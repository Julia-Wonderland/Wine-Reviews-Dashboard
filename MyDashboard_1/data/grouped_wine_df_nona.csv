100 Percent Wine,Red Blend,89.0,18.0,1,"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew."
100 Percent Wine,Sauvignon Blanc,84.0,18.0,1,"Soft, supple plum envelopes an oaky structure in this Cabernet, supported by 15% Merlot. Coffee and chocolate complete the picture, finishing strong at the end, resulting in a value-priced wine of attractive flavor and immediate accessibility."
1000 Stories,Zinfandel,90.0,19.0,1,"This wine from the Geneseo district offers aromas of sour plums and just enough cigar box to tempt the nose. The flavors are a bit flat at first, then the acidity and tension of sour cherries emerges in the midpalate, bolstered by some black licorice."
12C Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.6,92.6,5,"Oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated Pinot that hails from a high-elevation site. Small in production, it offers intense, full-bodied raspberry and blackberry steeped in smoky spice and smooth texture."
14 Hands,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,30.0,1,"As with many of the Erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. The notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. The fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes."
14 Hands,Cabernet Franc,90.0,30.0,1,"Syrupy and dense, this wine is jammy in plum and vanilla, with indeterminate structure and plenty of oak. Ripe and full-bodied, it has accents of graphite and leather."
14 Hands,Cabernet Franc-Merlot,91.0,30.0,1,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of barrel spice and cherry. The flavors are tart and elegant in style, with lightly gritty tannins backing them up. Best suited to the dinner table."
14 Hands,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,30.0,2,"There are intriguing touches to the nose of this bottling, with jasmine, sea salt, wet hay, quinine and rainy sidewalk. The structure on the sip is quite delicate, with golden apple and honey flavors."
14 Hands,Chardonnay,88.5,25.0,2,"A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this wine brings disjointed lightly volatile aromas of wood spice, vanilla and cherry. The plump cherry flavors are rounded out by woody barrel notes."
14 Hands,Gewürztraminer,85.0,22.0,1,"Big oak defines this robustly dense and extracted red, swimming in vanilla and cherry flavor. Full-bodied and gravelly in texture, it's a rustically pleasant wine for pizza nights and crowds."
14 Hands,Grenache,86.0,24.0,1,"Juicy plum, raspberry and pencil lead lead the way in this vineyard designate, a site that's 2,000 feet high. Tobacco and cedar meet a full-bodied hit of oak and puckering tannin, the wine still youthfully wrapped in its full-bodied boldness."
14 Hands,Malbec,87.0,24.0,1,This is the producer's first release of this wine. Fruity aromas of plum and tart cranberry add to its overall sense of lightness and understatement.
14 Hands,Merlot,90.0,30.0,2,"This is made from equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with small additions of Malbec. Juicy, it reveals a raisiny quality of ripeness around integrated oak and generous tannin."
14 Hands,Pinot Gris,85.0,22.0,1,"Some rosés are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine. Whether or not that is the case here, the wine has the simple pleasant lightly candied strawberry flavors one might expect from such a technique. It's fruity and undemanding. Drink up."
14 Hands,Red Blend,87.62,16.92,13,"A healthy addition of 13% Petite Sirah provides added weight and intensity to this wine, a soft, supple and richly conceived combination of smoky black fruit and mocha."
14 Hands,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,30.0,1,"Softened tannins surround a light-bodied, lean and herbal approach to this vineyard-designate, dotted in black pepper, leather and baked cherry."
14 Hands,Rosé,87.0,15.0,1,"This blend of Sangiovese, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and other varieties plays well to type. It shows a wealth of ripe, dusty black fruit that's richly round and soft on the palate, approachable and lightly oaked."
14 Hands,Sauvignon Blanc,85.5,22.0,2,"All red Bordeaux varieties are represented in this blend, except for Petit Verdot. Together, they offer a simple tannic structure that strengthens a chewiness of leather, tobacco and a touch of cedar. Full bodied, it's a ripe, bold and brawny wine."
14 Hands,Sparkling Blend,87.67,14.0,3,"Barrel notes are prominent, with aromas of Creamsicle and baking spice. The palate is broad and dry with stone-fruit and barrel flavors. It provides intrigue but the wood seems to get in the way at times."
14 Hands,Syrah,88.0,30.0,2,"This blends 20% each of all five red-Bordeaux varieties, showing grapy, plummy flavor that's juicy and soft on the palate. With a core of tobacco, tar and graphite, it complements the fruity with the savory, ending simply and elegantly."
14 Hands,Viognier,88.0,22.0,1,"Lots of spearmint, coyote mint, hot licorice, ginger snaps and Dr Pepper spice up the strawberry fruit of this wine that provides a very herbal take on the grape. Oregano, marjoram, thyme and dill all make a showing on the sip, against a backbone of sweet cherry and blackberry fruit, finishing on cedar."
14 Hands,White Blend,86.67,10.0,3,"This 100% varietal wine opens in a heady aroma of leather pouch, clove and marshmallow. Both herbaceous and tannic, it begs for more time in the bottle or substantial swirling in the glass."
18401 Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.67,75.0,3,"Tar, dried meat, olallieberry and sharp cedar aromas show on this blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon and 49% Merlot. Dried strawberries and plums mix with thyme and dried rose petals on the palate."
29 & Oak Wines,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,45.0,1,"The distinctive nose on this bottling is tight yet tropical, with mango, pineapple, pear skins, orange rinds, dried lime peels and a gin-like juniper all converging. The palate offers a balance between tightly woven texture and ripe tropicality, with lime rinds, mango and petrol touches."
29 & Oak Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,85.0,1,"Thick and brooding, this dark, sweetly tannic wine also offers higher-toned elements of cedar, dried herb and graphite. It finds its balance amid a full-bodied density of fruit concentration and girth of structure. Drink now through 2023."
29 & Oak Wines,Red Blend,90.0,45.0,1,"Cooked cranberry is spiced with anise, peppercorn and roasted beef slices on this bottling from a vineyard planted by three brothers who are longtime Salinas Valley farmers. The palate shows dark cranberry and raspberry, spiced up by chopped sage, thyme and bay leaf."
2Hawk,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,22.0,1,"There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas. The palate blends a gamy beef quality with oregano, marjoram, cooked strawberry, baked blackberry and a sesame-oil character."
2Hawk,Tempranillo,87.67,43.33,3,"Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties. It discloses a rich dark-chocolate sauce character on the palate as well as black-currant-jelly flavors, but most impressive is the lush, sexy and soft mouthfeel."
2Plank,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,52.0,1,"Smashed blackberry and blueberry fruit are enhanced by burned caramel, heavy slate and touches of soy and smoke on the nose. There's great depth in both body and flavors once sipped, with a layer of fine-grained tannins revealing teriyaki, black plum, boysenberry and touches of lavender."
2Plank,Viognier,88.0,34.0,1,"This wine shows off Yountville fruit at its finest, starting with a floral component to the nose. Spicy, bright and lifted, it coats the palate in ripe berry and cherry, ending with a snap of vanilla."
2Plank,Viognier-Chardonnay,84.0,25.0,1,"From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish."
3 Badge Beverage,Chardonnay,84.0,30.0,1,"Dark and thick in the glass, this wine shows strong but not bitter tar notes on the nose plus charred beef in a blueberry glaze, wet campfire, bourbon barrel and vanilla. The structure is massive now, gooey with thick tannins and flavors of espresso bean and condensed purple flowers. Judicious acidity ensures strong cellaring potential. Drink 2018–2027."
3 Horse Ranch Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,26.0,1,"A hearty blend of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this bottling packs a wallop of cinnamon-stick on the nose as well as strawberry puree, licorice and black pepper. Clove, allspice, and nutmeg arise immediately on the sip, backed by baked plum and bay leaf notes."
3 Horse Ranch Vineyards,Merlot,89.0,21.0,1,"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018–2034."
3 Steves Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,80.0,26.0,1,"A fairly elegant expression of the variety, this wine is bright in cherry kirsch and pretty aromas of rose petal and lavender, structured to age and enjoy with food. Rector Creek Vineyard is just north of Yountville and planted in rocky alluvial soils. Drink now through 2022."
3Fools,Pinot Noir,84.0,22.0,2,"This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table."
3Fools,Red Blend,82.0,22.0,1,"This is a soft, well-crafted wine from the eastern side of St. Helena that's both classic in its dried herb, tobacco and tea aromas and fruity with red currant and cranberry notes."
428 Wines,Red Blend,85.0,34.0,1,"This is a beatifully balanced, not-too-full-bodied wine from vines grown at 2,400 feet in the Sierra range. It has classic black cherry, black olive and anise aromas, harmonious fruit flavors accented with light oak spiciness and a firm, fine-grained tannic structure."
6 North,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,59.0,2,"This bottling belongs to a series of wines from the legendary Jerry Lohr emphasizing Rhône varieties. It shows candied blackberry, violets and potpourri on the fruity, flowery and inviting nose. The palate leads with savory black pepper, which accents its core of black plum, blackberry and purple flower flavors."
:Nota Bene,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.4,32.1,20,"Rich honeysuckle, marzipan and oak aromas meet bright lemongrass on the nose of this bottling, showing both the fresh and oxidative sides of the grape. Smoked chicken and brioche notes are prominent on the palate, leading to a tangy, botanical, juniper-laced finish."
:Nota Bene,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.67,36.67,3,"Juicy and austere in understated waves of cranberry and cherry fruit, this wine delivers subtle power and intensity in a leathery-textured package. True to its old vine heritage, it shows a dry dustiness of peppery spice."
:Nota Bene,Chardonnay,87.0,30.0,1,"This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, crème de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate."
:Nota Bene,Malbec,87.0,28.33,6,"This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone."
:Nota Bene,Merlot,88.5,33.0,4,"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne."
:Nota Bene,Mourvèdre,86.5,30.0,2,"This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice."
:Nota Bene,Red Blend,89.0,30.0,1,"Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors—tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins."
:Nota Bene,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.5,30.88,8,"Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment."
:Nota Bene,Syrah,88.91,36.55,11,"Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here. The wine's Zin almost tastes as if it has mountain tannins; the wine is overall herbal and earthy, ripe and sturdy with balanced fruit."
A Blooming Hill Vineyard,Pinot Noir,87.0,30.0,5,"Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels."
A Blooming Hill Vineyard,White Blend,87.0,19.0,1,"A good, clean, tart and lightly spicy all-stainless style. Cool climate fruit puts the accent on lime and lemon flavors, keeps the alcohol low (13.3%), and makes this a fine match to shellfish, white fish and light pasta dishes."
A to Z,Pinot Noir,90.0,28.0,1,"Plummy and hinting at black cherry, this wine is otherwise soft and simple, with a distracting, full-throttled descent into raisin cake and prune."
A to Z,Red Blend,88.0,20.0,1,"Citrus-kissed saltiness lies at the core of this incredibly delicious, deliriously crafted wine, from the great grape grower in the heart of the Russian River Valley. Beautifully crisp, it lingers in stony minerality and a freshness of apricot, memorable from first sip to last."
A.P. Vin,Pinot Noir,90.5,56.0,2,"A waft of smoky char and toasty oak provide a rich foundation and compelling entry into this one-acre vineyard-designate from the historic grower, before unleashing, slowly, a torrent of melon and fresh-cut apple with a length of intriguing nutmeg and cardamom. Medium-bodied and lush, it will remain on your palate memory a long time."
AVA Grace Vineyards,Chardonnay,86.0,9.0,1,"As impressive as the woman—a pioneer in the Napa Valley—was herself, this 100% varietal wine from the estate property high atop Diamond Mountain is powerfully elegant, intense yet refined. It begins with a high-toned, graceful entry that's rich in blueberry and chocolate, the oak smooth and integrated, with a suggestion of hand-rolled tobacco. Drink now through 2022."
AVA Grace Vineyards,Merlot,88.0,12.0,1,"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030."
Aaron,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,44.0,1,"Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry. Bone dry with excellent acidity, this somewhat tart wine is well made, and may be an ager."
Abacela,Albariño,87.0,18.0,1,"Fresh and delicate with floral and citrus overtones, this wine has an elegant character. Its dry, spicy flavors are subtle and refreshing, giving the wine food pairing flexibility. Ideally, though, think of spicy cuisine like Indian, Thai or Indonesian."
Abacela,Dolcetto,87.0,23.0,2,"All varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from top sites Ciel du Cheval, Conner Lee, Obelisco and Stonetree. The aromas are quite reserved, with notes of barrel spice that are followed by full-bodied fruit flavors with a spicy finish. It drinks well but the variety seems lost."
Abacela,Garnacha,88.0,29.0,1,"The light aromas suggest notes of star fruit and citrus. The palate is flavorful, with racy acids keeping the fruit in focus."
Abacela,Graciano,90.0,30.0,1,"This wine is dry and rather full bodied, starting with fruity aromas like banana and coconut then seguing to more nutty, oaky, complex flavors and a rich texture. It's a serious dinner wine with heft and substance."
Abacela,Grenache,88.0,15.0,1,"Aromas of coffee, barrel spice and dark-blue fruit lead to rich, full-bodied blackberry and spice flavors. It's not for the faint of heart but delivers a lot of enjoyment."
Abacela,Malbec,91.67,33.0,3,"Yellow pear, fresh-squeezed lime, light mint and wet-cement aromas show on the brisk nose of this bottling by veteran Adam Tolmach. A grippy texture and lively acidity frame the palate, where green apple and lime flavors show. It's clean, pure and easy."
Abacela,Red Blend,87.43,15.43,7,"This Tempranillo-based pinkie is quite inviting and tightly textured, with aromas of orange shave ice, strawberry cream, watermelon and cement. It is extremely zesty and lively once sipped, offering easy-to-drink raspberry and melon notes. It's great for all sorts of food, from spicy to rich."
Abacela,Rosé,88.0,17.0,3,"The aromas of whole lime, flowers, jasmine and watermelon Jolly Rancher pop. It drinks off dry, with floral flavors that carry through the finish."
Abacela,Syrah,89.2,31.6,5,"Smoky aromas and a bold apricot flavor give this dry and seemingly light-bodied wine a distinct personality. Fermented in small concrete egg-shaped vats, it's far from simple and fruity, and instead offers great acidity and a tangy, tempting, appetizing personality."
Abacela,Tannat,89.67,30.0,3,"Blended from all five Bordeaux varieties, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot almost equal in proportion, this is a lovely, well-crafted wine, softly concentrated with highlights of licorice, lavender, violets and black pepper. From three ranches farmed by the family, it's both seamless and structured."
Abacela,Tempranillo,90.0,38.83,12,"Berry crumble and licorice star in this full-bodied, hearty and smooth wine, blended with 4% Petite Sirah. Spicy oak and milk chocolate unleash further flavor and spice on the finish."
Abacela,Tinta Amarela,90.0,30.0,1,"Proving that exceptional wines can be (and were) made in this cool, light vintage, this estate-grown selection is both elegant and complex. Flavors of mixed wild berries, a streak of tea, a whiff of peach and compelling balance carry it through an extended finish."
Abacela,Viognier,85.0,25.0,1,"A marvelous Pinot Blanc, this combines aromatic hints of almond with mixed citrus fruit and rind, zippy acidity and a great wash of minerality. It cleanses and tickles the palate, lingering sensuously through a finish of surprising depth."
Abbot's Passage,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,85.0,1,"Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade."
Abbot's Passage,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,60.0,1,"This Stella Mae is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. It remains a rather lean wine in the Sparkman portfolio, despite having alcohol at 14.6%. Here are lightly earthy flavors of strawberry and herb, with a hint of green in the tannins."
Abeja,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.25,64.25,4,"This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through. Its acidity sings perfectly through the middle of the wine, lifting the flavors of apple and dried apricot as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish. This should pair with a range of midweek dinners."
Abeja,Viognier,90.0,30.0,1,"This wine has the variety's trademark notes of herb, green bell pepper, with a woodsy qulaity. This is a full-bodied effort, bearing a long, spicy finish."
Aberrant Cellars,Pinot Noir,91.36,43.09,11,A Verdelho with a taste of nuts—like Marcona almonds—it gets more fruity and aromatic after a good swirl. This is marked by a tangy sweetness on the finish.
Abiqua Wind,Gewürztraminer,88.0,15.0,2,"Medium bodied, this sharply defined wine brings in plenty of notes of herb, root and earth around its light berry fruit. It captures the defining flavors of Wahluke Slope Syrah in a somewhat muted style, reflecting the abbreviated growing season."
Abiqua Wind,Muscat,84.67,13.67,3,"This would be a straightforward Bordeaux red blend if not for the 5% Petite Sirah within. Together, it's 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec as well, sourced from Howell Mountain and valley floor sites. Dusty and herbal, the wine is thick and sizably tannic, with dense black fruit, leather and coffee."
Abiqua Wind,Müller-Thurgau,83.0,12.0,1,"Flint and smoke aromas show strongly on this bottling, alongside hints of lemon balm and a rustic apple cider vinegar savory kick. Tangy smoked tangerine flavors show on the energized sip, where a unique sandalwood smoky quality plays with more cider-like tang."
Abiqua Wind,Pinot Gris,86.0,12.0,1,"Big tannins support the layers of extracted, concentrated fruit that leans red into cherry, cassis and currant. Char and vanilla speak for the oak."
Abiqua Wind,Pinot Noir,83.0,25.0,1,"Delicate in cranberry and strawberry, this wine is highlighted in uplifted acidity and plenty of length and breadth within its medium-bodied structure. A pleasing streak of cardamom is consistent throughout, as accents of forest floor and cola figure in."
Abiqua Wind,White Blend,88.0,15.0,1,"This is a relatively thick and dense wine, grippy in tannin and oak at first, youthful and desiring of time and air. Beyond its strength, its shows the beginnings of delicacy and grace, commingling raspberry with clove and tea."
Acacia,Chardonnay,88.75,40.75,8,"This is a soft, smooth and earthy wine, still unraveling from its youth, that's crisp and fresh in acidity. Chewy still in texture, it offers a glorious celebration of red cherry, rhubarb, tea and clove."
Acacia,Pinot Noir,89.6,54.27,15,"Deliciously fruity but also well-structured, this full-bodied wine has excellent concentration and good balance. Effusive aromas of blueberry and black cherry lead to opulent but not overripe berry flavors that are lightly accented by clove and cinnamon nuances."
Ackerman Family Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon-Sangiovese,90.0,50.0,1,"Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff."
Acorn,Red Blend,93.0,48.0,2,"This is a delicate yet flavorful take on this grape, from a biodynamic, cool-climate vineyard. Light red plum and hibiscus aromas meet with sweet herbs and cinnamon spice on the nose. The lithe palate offers candied strawberry with thyme, anise and touches of garden herbs, with that red fruit flavor carrying deep into the finish. Would pair great with spicy food."
Acorn,Sangiovese,91.0,30.0,1,"The Sims is amped up in 2014, dark and thick and showing a roasted character. Mocha, black tea and Kahlua flavors push the palate into a gritty charred mode. It's delicious, liquorous, and suitable for smoky ribs or a juicy burger. Drink now through 2020."
Acorn,Syrah,90.5,35.5,2,"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish. Give it another year or two of bottle age and drink after 2019."
Acorn,Zinfandel,90.0,45.0,1,"Wood spice, cherry and herb aromas are followed by luscious cherry flavors. It keeps you coming back for more with a high yum factor."
Acquiesce,Rosé,90.0,24.0,1,"There's an expert balance between lightly melted butter, pithy Meyer lemon and toasted marcona almond on the nose of this bottling from the region's iconic vineyard. The palate is wound up tightly, offering good grip and lots of textural length while showing flavors of chamomile, saffron, sea salt and more Meyer lemon rinds."
Acquiesce,White Blend,90.0,26.0,1,"Just 8% of this reserve spent time in new oak, putting the emphasis on juicy jammy flavors of cranberry fruit. It rolls into sour cherry, some citrus and a most refreshing, clean and vivid mouthfeel. Drink now and into the mid-2020s."
Acrobat,Pinot Noir,88.33,13.67,3,"From the sought-after site on Westside Road, this wine delivers a nuanced, elegant expression of juicy red cherry, plum, pomegranate and light, compelling spice. With a depth of body and soft, integrated tannin, it's complex without being overpowering, finishing in a mix of sautéed mushroom and forest floor."
Acrobat,Rosé,89.0,14.0,1,"One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least."
Acumen,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,60.0,2,"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel. This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet."
Ad Vivum,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,130.0,2,"Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out."
Adair Bachman,Rosé,90.0,35.0,2,"Black plum, charred wood, coffee syrup and cracked black pepper show on the excellently bright nose of this bottling. The flavors are equally intriguing, with umami touches of charred beef along with rosemary, bay leaf, olie and more black pepper."
Adamant Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,27.0,2,"This is sourced from 30-year-old Wädenswil vines from a vineyard in the Elkton AVA. It's complex and compelling, showing layers of stone, strawberry, citrus, chocolate and sassafras. It's an elegant wine, well proportioned and modest in scope, but delicious."
Adamant Cellars,Merlot,88.0,42.0,1,"Bright pomegranate and dried strawberry notes start the aromas on this bottling and then descend into more brooding cola, smoked herbs, cinnamon and spicy hibiscus. There is herbal and mineral depth to the palate, with raspberry, cranberry and pencil lead flavors that evolve toward fruit punch, thyme and earth. It's light in body but full of grippy texture."
Adamant Cellars,Red Blend,89.0,25.33,3,"A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets. The palate is heavily spiced with clove, gingerbread, a touch of juniper, lots of earthy sagebrush and a strong cranberry fruit, all seasoned by an iron-powered minerality."
Adamant Cellars,Syrah,87.0,35.0,1,"From one of the more exciting and westernmost vineyards in the region, this bottling shows earthy, gamey aromas alongside ripe red and purple fruits, pairing plum and black cherry with minty, musky herbs. The palate shows dried olive, tart orange peels, red plums, baked figs and pine needles, proving deliciously savory and intense."
Adamant Cellars,White Blend,86.0,18.0,1,"Strong elements of black pepper and smoky oak beg for steak to be paired with this 100% varietal wine. It showcases sizable weight and a solid tannic structure, with supple expressions of black cherry and chocolate that linger long on the rich finish. This bold beauty should hold well through 2023."
Adams Bench,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,39.0,2,"From Paso's blending vanguards, this mix of 62% Syrah, 19% Petite Sirah, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Malbec offers an intriguing nose of sesame, soy, cracked pepper, fresh blackberry and raw beef. There is cedar and toasted pine on the palate as well as smoked meats, black pepper, teriyaki and an elderberry-blackberry base."
Adams Bench,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.83,51.67,12,"This is a gorgeous wine, blended with 8% Merlot, 1% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, and aged entirely in new French oak. Juicy waves of cassis and red currant are accented by dark chocolate, ultimately showcasing a lush, plush yet structured palate. It's decadent now, but should age well through 2022."
Addendum,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,95.0,2,"Crisp green apple is the star in this well-made, balanced and elegant wine, that's tangy yet smooth, with a voluptuous tease of anise. Approachably structured, the complexity of the texture and lurking layers of further flavor suggest letting this wine open slowly to unveil its true self, and allowing it to linger on the palate."
Adega Northwest,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,36.0,1,"Deep aromas of dried strawberries and blueberries meet with hot bricks, dried meats, purple flowers, a touch of smoke and secondary notes of truffle on the nose of this delicious smelling and tasting wine. The layers of flavor on the palate range from black cherry to milk chocolate, framed by chalky tannins."
Adelaida,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,75.0,1,"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site. It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper unveil to tremendous effect."
Adelaida,Chardonnay,88.0,40.0,1,"The estate-grown grapes for this wine come from some of the appellation's highest-elevation sites, at the base of Mount Veeder. Natural acidity is the star of the show, a nice surprise after a decadent honeyed color and bouquet. Serious texture and complexity give way to a touch of salted caramel and peach."
Adelaida,Mourvèdre,88.0,32.0,1,"From the gorgeous, mighty Pagani, planted in 1895, comes this powerfully rich and refined wine, a study in woodsy rusticity and layers of fig, blackberry and a stick of cinnamon. Full bodied and luxurious on the palate, a lithe jolt of acidity rears its head just before the finish, trying to compete with the licorice and leather. Drink now through 2020."
Adelaida,Pinot Noir,90.5,32.5,2,"Winemaker Dennis Martin puts grape grower Stephen Miller's signature on this wine, a nod to the importance of this historic vineyard. The wine shows bright strawberry and raspberry with touch of savory wood smoke as well as hibiscus-laced pastry and a pinch of thyme. Earthy sagebrush and wild herb flavors frame the palate, where cooked cherries and cranberries are spiced by cardamom and dried ginger spice."
Adelaida,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.67,28.67,3,"It's fun to rattle off a few of the numerous aromas and flavors in this exotic but subtle wine: tangerine, pastry cream, blanched almonds and a touch of honey. The wine is refreshing, dry and nicely braced with acidity, but at the same time rather broad and soothing in texture. In other words, beautifully balanced and wonderfully complex."
Adelaida,Rhône-style White Blend,89.75,30.0,4,"This mostly Syrah blends in 6% Grenache, combining the two grapes from the property's estate into an opaque, juicy expression of black licorice, tar, cigar, grilled mushrooms atop a meaty steak and plenty of black pepper. Big and bold in every sense of the word, it retains just enough acidity to maintain an inviting nature and beguiling floral backbone."
Adelaida,Rosé,90.0,20.0,1,"As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare. Plum, black cherry, leather and black pepper jump from the glass, slowly and with purpose, around a core of burly tannin and intensely floral aromatics. This is a great wine."
Adelaida,Viognier,90.0,35.0,2,"In the big, ripe and saturated school of winemaking, this wine has a deep color, oodles of black cherry and blackberry flavors and full body. It also has enough firm tannin and acidity to keep the structure lively and the finish fresh, so it's a lot of fun to drink and can take on all kinds of rich proteins at dinner."
Adelaida,Zinfandel,89.5,43.0,2,"Plump black plums and concentrated hibiscus fruit meet with cola, sarsaparilla and tart dried orange rind on the nose of this bottling. The palate is more earth-driven, with crushed rocks, pine needle and mint flavors spicing up the tart plum skins and berries. The texture is excitingly grippy."
Adelaida Cellars,Mourvèdre,90.0,50.0,1,"Spicy cracked peppercorns, light tar, fresh picked lavender and light purple fruits show on the savory nose of this bottling. More strong pepper notes show on the palate, as do tart elderberries, sesame, soy and hoisin elements, with a nice smoked meat character adding to the delicious complexity."
Adelaida Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,50.0,1,"There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas. The palate, framed by chalky tannins, offers more mushrooms and truffles in a black cherry-chocolate gravy, proving quite luxurious and interesting at once."
Adelaida Cellars,Syrah,88.0,60.0,1,"Softened by 6% Merlot, this lovely concoction opens with a waft of smoky cigar box, becoming a bold, loud expression of the variety dotted in classic notes of cassis and cedar. A luxuriously velvety texture is the standout, though, supported by great structure and length."
Adelsheim,Auxerrois,89.75,22.75,4,"This is a lovely wine, classically rendered in cedar, herb and red cherry. The dried herb and forest floor elements persist on the palate, with bursts of acidity giving it life and lingering persistence, the tannins well-integrated."
Adelsheim,Chardonnay,91.2,43.7,10,"The aromas are bright, with notes of barrel spice, vanilla, pineapple and lees. The palate is full bodied, with textured and richly flavored tropical fruit notes that lead to a warm vanilla-filled finish. The oak seems a bit heavy handed."
Adelsheim,Pinot Auxerrois,89.0,22.0,1,"Aromas of sea salt, olive brine, smoked meat, herb and earth lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that run warm on the finish. There are plenty of good things going on but they don't seem to entirely come together."
Adelsheim,Pinot Blanc,90.0,24.0,3,"This one-of-a-kind in the state wine was fermented on skins for 12 days, giving it a light-orange color. The aromas leap up from the glass, with notes of spice, lychee, orange peel and mineral. The palate is dry and textured, with a rich but still sleek feel. Put it on the dinner table to see it shine."
Adelsheim,Pinot Noir,91.51,77.09,43,"This incredibly zesty and fruity bottling shows raspberry, lavender and white pepper on the nose. It's fun to sip, with snappy red fruits and hibiscus most prominent. Complexity comes from touches of rooibos tea and potpourri. It's still extremely youthful."
Adelsheim,Syrah,89.33,45.0,3,"This is an expressive example of this variety, especially considering the stainless steel aging. The aromas are bright, with notes of apple, pear and melon. The cantaloupe flavors are broad and fleshy, lingering on the finish. It brings a lot of appeal."
Admirable Family Vineyard,Syrah-Merlot,88.0,59.0,1,"Purple fruit and wood spice intermingle on the aromas, along with clove, herb and baking spice, showing a touch of volatility. The fruit flavors are big and bold, bringing a sense of structure and liveliness. It's an intriguing example of the variety from an up-and-coming vineyard."
Admirable Family Vineyard,Viognier-Chardonnay,88.0,49.0,1,"Light and lively aromas of dried red berries, concentrated roses, cola and black plums show on the nose of this very accessible and pleasurable Sangiovese. The cohesive palate integrates cherry, cola and milk-chocolate flavors into an easy-drinking frame, perfect for barbecues or family-style Italian meals."
Aequorea,Pinot Gris,93.0,34.0,1,"It's rare to find a varietally labeled Grenache that comes in under 13% alcohol, but here you have it. Blended with 10% Syrah, it has notes of white pepper, smoked meat, savory spices and red fruit. What it lacks in terms of depth it makes up for in purity and elegance."
Aequorea,Pinot Noir,93.33,43.33,3,"Named after the blending of Steelhead Run and Ox vineyard blocks, this appealing wine is fresh and varietal with notes of ripe peach and herbs. Aged six months in stainless steel and coming in at a low 12% alcohol, the fruit concentration is lighter in style but still offers enjoyment."
Aesthete,Sauvignon Blanc,93.0,55.0,1,"Grüner Veltliner, though still rare, shows good promise in Oregon. This is a big, sappy, ripe version that's borderline syrupy, with big flavors of peaches and apricots. But the supporting acids, and a lick of mineral, keep it from crashing."
Aether Wine Company,Chardonnay,94.0,36.0,1,"Each year, this wine is intended to be an experiment. This vintage's creativity involves the addition of soil from the Santa Rita Hills to vineyards in the Russian River Valley. Yeasty on the nose, the result is rich and decadent, a wine that's juicy and velvety in black and red fruit and pillowy tannins. A warmth of spice lingers on the finish."
Aether Wine Company,Pinot Noir,94.5,57.5,2,"From a two-acre block within the amazing Maple Vineyard planted in 1910, this wine also contains 10% Petite Sirah and 10% mixed blacks. Baked berry pie comes to mind first, conjuring up all things good and right in the world, topped in bourbon whipped cream and nutmeg. Good acidity buoys the proceedings. Drink now through 2021."
Agate Ridge,Petite Sirah,84.0,26.0,1,"Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic. Aromas of browned toast, popcorn, Meyer-lemon pith, honey pollen and a mineral herbal chamomile character show on the nose. A vibrant chalkiness reveals itself on the sip, with lemon blossom and grapefruit pith keeping the palate tight, grippy and texturally zippy."
Agate Ridge,Pinot Gris,85.0,14.0,1,"Boosted by 5% Petit Verdot, this bottling shows lush aromas of fudge, black plum, black currant, soy and black pepper. The palate is dense and thick with more black fruit as well as caramel, purple flowers, milk chocolate and mint-chip ice cream, proving concentrated and decadent."
Agate Ridge,Pinot Noir,82.0,24.0,1,"Pommard and Wädenswil clones are combined here, yielding a stylish, well-defined wine with spicy berry fruit. Flavors punch through into a deep and detailed finish, with streaks of cola and caramel. The balance is spot-on."
Agate Ridge,Red Blend,83.0,38.5,2,"With a smidgen of Petit Verdot, this dark, tight and leathery wine is exalted in tobacco, graphite and tar, still youthfully awkward and shy. The flavors lean savory into meaty aspects of currant and clove, waiting to find companionship in fruit. Drink now after a decant, or cellar through 2023."
Agate Ridge,Syrah,88.0,24.0,1,"This is one of the best balanced and most elegant Zins around. Very fresh in aroma, it's slightly yeasty like freshly fermented wine, and with subtly gorgeous cherry and blackberry flavors layered with light cedar and cocoa spiciness. Not only is the finish lingering, but the wine still tasted great two days after pulling the cork."
Agate Ridge,Viognier,82.5,19.0,2,"This cuvée is made with the oldest Pommard clones in the estate vineyard. It's a sharp-edged, reserve-level wine with a defining streak of peppery herb. The black fruits and barrel flavors of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate promise further depth as it ages. Drink 2020–2030."
Agnitio,Chardonnay,90.0,55.0,2,"Syrupy thick at first, decadent enough for a king, this rich red is defined by vanilla French toast and blackberry jam aromas and flavors. It finds balance midway through on the palate, veering into crisper red tones of cranberry and rhubarb. Time will help mellow things out. Cellar through 2020."
Agnitio,Pinot Noir,86.0,70.0,1,"Ripe black cherry and vanilla swirl around notes of cedar and dusty tannins, combining seamlessly on the palate. From an appellation not known for the variety, it does justice to mountain fruit and power, finishing with substance."
Aiken,Pinot Noir,92.0,55.0,1,"All varietal, this wine offers unique aromas of toast, fig, dried herb and exotic spice. The purple fruit flavors are deft in style with a pleasing sense of balance, length and texture."
Airfield Estates,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.5,29.33,6,"Dark berry, herb and fig aromas lead to dense, full and palate-coating dark fruit flavors. It checks all the boxes for varietal correctness, concentration and value."
Airfield Estates,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.33,30.67,3,"From a knoll in Carneros, oft thought of as chilly for Cabernet, this wine exhibits cooler aspects of the variety, from pencil lead and cedar to dried herb. It is complemented by fruitier characteristics of cassis and plum, finishing in dusty, structured tannins. Cellar through 2017–2020."
Airfield Estates,Chardonnay,87.33,18.83,6,"Otis Harlan Vineyard in the Rattlesnake Hills provides the fruit for this wine. Distinctive aromas of lees, almond, toast and grass lead to creamy stone-fruit flavors that show persistence on the finish."
Airfield Estates,Merlot,86.0,18.0,1,"Brooding aromas of barrel spice, black cherry, coffee bean and herb lead to tart, focused fruit and barrel flavors that linger."
Airfield Estates,Red Blend,85.8,22.2,5,"All Syrah, this blend of Yakima Valley and Wahluke Slope fruit offers aromas and flavors of cocoa, vanilla, pepper and dark cherry. The pleasing interplay of fruit and barrel comes with a soft, pillowy feel."
Airfield Estates,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.25,25.0,4,"This wine is aromatically reserved with notes of milk chocolate, char, berry, barrel spices and high-toned herbs. It's silky and polished in feel, with richness and elegance to the coffee flavors."
Airfield Estates,Rhône-style White Blend,88.5,19.0,2,"This wine pushes the notion of low alcohol, giving soft and subtle an extreme definition. As such, it will not please everyone. Earthy spice and an exotic notion of orange blossom dance around a light, clear body and high-toned minerality. It hails from a foggy, shaded vineyard in Freestone."
Airfield Estates,Riesling,87.33,19.33,3,"Straw-yellow in the glass, this wine from organically grown, nearly 35-year-old vines shows iodine, citrus pith, yogurt and seared lemon peels in the restrained, minerally nose. The even-keeled, focused palate seamlessly integrates dairy elements with tangerine rinds and a mellow acidity."
Airfield Estates,Rosé,86.67,15.0,3,"This appealing wine displays aromas of cherry, plum, cocoa, pencil lead and Mounds Bar. It's reserved in style with tart cranberry and cherry flavors, showing a good sense of acid balance along with grainy tannins."
Airfield Estates,White Blend,87.33,14.33,3,"From vineyards in the high-desert Cuyama Valley comes this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Tempranillo, 20% Grenache and 15% Petite Sirah. On the nose, it shows chopped fresh mint, rose blossoms, fennel, black cherries and teriyaki beef jerky. Black pepper and soy mark the palate, along with blackberry juice and a slate-driven minerality."
Airlie,Chardonnay,84.33,15.33,3,"This deep-colored, full-bodied red gets a little swagger in its step from enticing smoky oak aromas and powerful black-fruit flavors that also carry that spicy oak streak. This is brash enough for slow-cooked barbecue but sophisticated enough for osso buco. The texture is fine-grained from supportive tannin, and the finish lingers. Best now through 2018."
Airlie,Gewürztraminer,90.0,16.0,1,"Aromas of dark chocolate, dried and fresh herbs, raspberries and black cherry predominate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Creamy, rich and focused, it has a pleasing sense of texture and vanilla flavors that carry across the finish. It's truly a standout wine at this price."
Airlie,Pinot Noir,86.0,35.0,1,"Only the second vintage of this vineyard-designate wine from an estate property, this bottling offers spicy cherry, black tea and dried herb, backed by oaky backbone and structure. Dark chocolate and leather play on the palate in subtle waves, hitting their strides on the finish. Cellar through 2020."
Airlie,Riesling,90.33,18.67,3,"Floral and herbal from the get-go, this medium-bodied white from a great vineyard offers a lot to like. Stainless-steel fermentation gives it a lean underbelly, rounded out by sharp Meyer lemon and tangerine, buoyed by mouthwatering acidity. Green apple and an accent of honey peak on the finish."
Albatross Ridge,Chardonnay,92.5,55.0,2,"Light in color and weight, this vineyard-designate conveys a wealth of rose petals, earth and bright, crisp red cherry. Compellingly layered and shy, it defines the term ethereal. The finish is medium in length and accented in spicy cardamom."
Albatross Ridge,Pinot Noir,92.8,52.0,5,"This wine combines fruit from both cool and warm sites, which in the vintage might have both leaned on the warmer side. Black fruit and licorice give it a burly character at first. Decanting or letting the wine open in the glass will help, but still it retains smooth, velvety tannins and resolved oak."
Alder Fels,Chardonnay,88.0,20.0,1,"Ripe plum and plenty of vanilla and cherry provide the perception of sweetness in this wine. That sensation may stem from the pushing-the-envelope generosity of the ripe fruit or from the oak. or both. It makes for a full-bodied, heady experience."
Alderbrook,Zinfandel,90.0,18.0,1,"A big burly Syrah from this Temecula producer whose goal it is to become the premier winery of Southern California, the wine is loaded with plummy black fruit and a peppery mouthfeel, its oakiness derived from the almost three years it spent barrel-aging in new French oak. Not for the meek at 15.6% alcohol, it finishes a tad sweet."
Aleksander,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.0,95.0,1,"The Lorna Marie is the winery's reserve, and it has exceptional concentration and depth. Berry and cherry dominate, spiced up with a pumpkin pie accent. Round, rich and full, yet moderate in alcohol, this is a fine expression of Oregon Pinot Noir in a challenging vintage."
Alexana,Pinot Gris,91.0,32.0,1,"All the 2010 Patton Valley Pinots are significantly lower in alcohol than the previous vintage, and it works to their advantage. Nuanced fruit flavors include rhubarb and tart cherry, with veins of cola and dark chocolate adding further complexity. Its length is excellent."
Alexana,Pinot Noir,91.33,47.33,3,"The Winderlea is perhaps the most unique in terms of style and flavor among all the 2010 Adelsheim single-vineyard Pinots. Its distinctive minerality accompanies tart cranberry and cherry notes, citrusy acidity with a splash of grapefruit flavor, and a finish that tastes of coffee and tea. Complex and long, this is a wine that will surely spark some heated discussion."
Alexana,Riesling,91.0,28.0,2,"Robust black fruit forms around a dense, leathery core of concentration and richness before allowing room for softer, intertwined tannins to add structure and more depth. Chocolate marks the finish of this big, bold wine."
Alexander Valley Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,65.0,1,"The variety is unmistakable, with notes of dried herb, dark cherry and espresso. The jammy fruit flavors are rich, with lightly grainy tannins and coffee notes on the finish. It shows a fine sense of balance."
Alexander Valley Vineyards,Cabernet Franc,86.0,28.0,1,"Just one barrel was produced from the own-rooted vines planted almost 50 years ago. It's earthy and scented with a menthol/eucalyptus note, that carries on through. Cranberry flavor reflects the rather low alcohol, but there is no hint of unripeness or any vegetative character."
Alexander Valley Vineyards,Chardonnay,85.0,18.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (66%), Cabernet Sauvignon (20%) and Syrah. The aromas are brooding, with notes of earth, toast, red fruit and spice. The palate brings tart tangy cranberry flavors that linger on the finish."
Alexander Valley Vineyards,Pinot Noir,84.0,28.0,1,"Made entirely from Syrah grown on its property across multiple vintages, and then cave-aged six years in American oak, this is a nice dessert wine, raisiny and brimming in Christmas spice. With plenty of body and acidity, it swims effortlessly and smoothly on the palate, a bite of decadence that will work well with rich cheeses."
Alexander Valley Vineyards,Syrah,91.0,20.0,1,"Aromas of savory herbs, mineral, exotic spice and red fruit are followed by fruit flavors that are surprisingly restrained considering the warmth of the vintage. Tart acidity livens it up. It's green for the variety but still brings enjoyment."
Alexander Valley Vineyards,Zinfandel,84.0,20.0,2,"The aromas of mineral, spice, toast, yellow apple and lemon pith are light but enchanting. The palate is medium bodied and refined, demonstrating judicious use of oak and a lengthy finish that shows some warmth."
Alexander the Grape,Red Blend,88.0,50.0,1,"Very smooth, almost thick, this is a rich wine in flavor and mouthfeel. It practically oozes over the palate, dripping with ripe pineapple, vanilla and cream, and coats every corner of the mouth before lingering through a long finish. It's full bodied, soft and concentrated."
Alexander the Grape,Sémillon,89.0,50.0,1,"All from Rosebud Vineyard, this moderately aromatic wine brings notes of herbs and pineapple, with Sémillon (15%) adding fig to the mix. The concentration doesn't seem all there and it needs a bit more acid to stand it up."
Alexandria Nicole,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.0,45.0,1,"Despite the abv listed, this wine does not seem especially ripe. Peppery highlights carry a whiff of onion, and between the alcohol burn and the green edges, the wine has not come together. Aging in 40% new oak adds some toast, but not grip or density."
Alexandria Nicole,Cabernet Franc,86.0,42.0,2,"Aged for 20 months in 40% new French oak, this remains a tough nut to crack. It's encased in a hard tannic shell, with little ripe fruit, and is strongly flavored with barrel notes of tobacco and vanilla. Decant it or put it through an aerator."
Alexandria Nicole,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,28.0,2,"Quite buttery and nutty on the nose, this wine shows Marcona almonds, seared pineapple, crème brûlée and vanilla custard. Those elements meet with smart amounts of acid and texture on each creamy, buttery, pineapple-laced sip, which then finishes on marshmallow flavors."
Alexandria Nicole,Chardonnay,88.0,14.0,1,"Fresh cracked peppercorn, dense black and purple fruit and a cedar tone carry through the nose of this lavish yet nuanced bottling from a South Coast winery that practices extended aging before release. The elderberry fruit is hung on a strong tannic structure, bolstered by woody cigar box, incense, juniper and espresso flavors."
Alexandria Nicole,Grenache,88.5,40.0,2,"Lighter bramble and red-currant fruits pop on the nose of this wine from the appellation's eastern end, as do baking-spice notes, crushed vanilla and hibiscus. It's airy on the palate, with tense cranberry and pomegranate, crushed oregano and dill, pencil lead minerality and a slowly simmering acidity."
Alexandria Nicole,Malbec,86.0,38.0,2,"Fresh fruit flavors suggest a bowl full of berries and cherries. Crisp acids help to focus the wine, with spot-on varietal flavors and balance. Both elegant and complex, it's a lovely bottle from an under-the-radar producer."
Alexandria Nicole,Merlot,89.33,25.0,3,"The most reserved of this winery's Grenache studies, this bottling shows baked red cherry, red currant, cola and slate on the nose. An iron-based minerality shows on the earthy palate, which also offers chipped slate, cranberry and tart cherry elements. It's a tad light but still intriguingly textured."
Alexandria Nicole,Petit Verdot,89.0,42.0,1,"A complex mix of wild berry, cherry and somewhat brambly fruits provides a substantial core to this wine. The fruit rolls on through a slightly chalky patch, then finishes with a flourish of toast and graphite."
Alexandria Nicole,Petite Sirah,90.0,42.0,1,"A riot of licorice, cassis, toast and berry, this 83% Cabernet Sauvignon/17% Petit Verdot Bordeaux-style blend is currently showing a lot of barrel flavors, with subdued but not insignificant fruit. Medium-grained tannins give the finish some gravitas."
Alexandria Nicole,Pinot Gris,87.0,14.0,2,"Aged a little more than two years in 90% new French oak and then in bottle, time has been kind to this wine, a Syrah of dark mushroom and baked blackberry, that's savory and silky with a slight hint of mint on the finish. Mighty and impressive."
Alexandria Nicole,Red Blend,88.57,35.57,7,"Dusty and tight, with a whiff of coffee and cocoa introducing an elegant wine with interesting streaks of metal and graphite. Young fruit and fine tannins are in perfect balance, and the wine has a lovely delicacy."
Alexandria Nicole,Rhône-style White Blend,91.0,20.0,2,"This light, refreshing rosé mixes fresh strawberry fruit with apple-flavored acids. It's finished bone dry, with an almost dusty mouthfeel (in a good kind of way)."
Alexandria Nicole,Riesling,88.33,16.0,3,"This is smooth and accessible, putting a light chocolate frame around rhubarb and strawberry fruit. There's a hint of pepper, and the wine is fresh and youthful, good sipping wine for late summer/early fall."
Alexandria Nicole,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,18.0,1,"Quite tart, the fruit here touches (just barely) on melon, with orange and lemon zest, a bit of lime, and plenty of acid. All stainless fermented, it went through full malolactic."
Alexandria Nicole,Syrah,88.0,25.0,1,"An earthy, nutty aroma and flavor come through the intense sweetness and full body of this dessert-style wine. It goes for earthy complexity rather than obvious fruit flavors, and tastes high in sugar and alcohol."
Alexandria Nicole,Viognier,88.5,24.0,2,"This full-bodied wine is in the classic mode, offering very ripe and even overripe aromas. Voluptuous berry flavors verge on sweet, and the rich texture comes without a lot of drying tannin."
Alexandria Nicole,White Blend,88.67,19.33,3,"This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the wood—31% new and 26% once-used—seems to show a bit of rawness. Give this another couple of years of bottle age before opening."
Alias,Red Blend,86.0,10.0,2,"This is a pleasant white wine, albeit rather generic, as Pinot Blanc is prone to be. Crisp apple flavors and a touch of grapefruit are the focus. Drink chilled and enjoy it while it's still young and fresh."
All About Red,Red Blend,89.0,13.0,1,"This wine puts jammy aromas, very ripe flavors, full body and deep, dark fruit flavors on a broad, soft texture."
Alleromb,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.67,66.67,3,"Sharply defined, this has piercing, penetrating high notes that are both floral and fruity. Its lemon and tangerine fruit is amped up with some alcoholic burn. Aerating it helps to smooth it out."
Alleromb,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,90.0,1,"Director's sources from vineyards across the county to offer an intensity of fruit flavor that tends lush and ripe. Melon and vanilla appear on the nose and palate, with a side tone of pineapple, nutmeg and even clove, finishing clean and with simplicity."
Alleromb,Chardonnay,90.0,44.67,3,"Small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah are blended within this wine, given 17 months in new French oak plus once and twice-used barrels. The oak is integrated within this otherwise leathery, tannic and mild-mannered wine, ripe in cherry and cassis."
Alleromb,Grenache,89.0,65.0,1,"This is a highly structured wine with an abundance of fine-grained tannins and firm acidity to support pure raspberry and blackberry flavors. It tastes as if it was made for aging, so wait and drink after 2019."
Alleromb,Malbec,91.0,60.0,1,"This new “i” series offering mixes brambly strawberry fruit with granular tannins. It's ready to drink, dappled with cinnamon, and leaves a slightly medicinal aftertaste in the back of the mouth."
Alleromb,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,40.0,1,"Full-bodied and smooth in texture, this generous-tasting wine has lots of ripe plum flavors and sweet-seeming oak accents."
Alleromb,Syrah,89.5,77.5,2,"The great Ritchie Vineyard, a renowned site for Chardonnay, also possesses highly sought-after Sauvignon Blanc. Here, it shows as grassy in pea shoots and thick, with a voluptuous texture and body weight."
Alloro,Chardonnay,92.75,31.0,4,"It's soft, slightly oxidized, and generic. It's pleasantly quaffable, marked in the finish by some rather bitter toast."
Alloro,Pinot Noir,93.4,54.0,10,"Aromas of cherry, spice and mint lead into tart pie cherry and wild berry fruit, dusted with cocoa and spiced up with 16 months in French oak barrels. Unusual for most high-end Pinots, this is sealed with a screwcap."
Allure,Moscato,84.0,13.0,1,"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole."
Alma Fria,Chardonnay,93.0,40.0,1,"This blend from a newer Westside Paso winery offers blackberry, charred pine and sour cherry aromas. The palate is driven by pine sap, charred game and sharp herbs such as oregano and rosemary, and would be a great way to spice up a steak dinner."
Alma Fria,Pinot Noir,90.6,55.2,5,"A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot. The creosote sense carries to the palate, meeting with black cherry, dried bouquet garni and quite grippy tannins."
Alma Rosa,Chardonnay,90.67,28.67,3,"Estate bottled, this assemblage of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot opens with a flurry of coconut flake and herb, followed by ripe, rich layers of dark berry and black tea. The wine has power yet also possesses an elegance that stands out, finishing with a taste of dark caramel."
Alma Rosa,Pinot Noir,91.67,54.58,12,"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex."
Alma Rosa,Sparkling Blend,91.0,61.0,3,"The pretty fruit flavors suggest relatively young vines, bringing light cherry to the front and center. Hints of marzipan, a flash of finishing heat and subtle chalkiness run through the finish. Another year or two of bottle age should continue to improve this one."
Alma Sol,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,90.0,38.0,1,"There's a substantial earthiness to this Chardonnay, grown in a relatively cool estate vineyard. Vibrant on the palate in ripe apple and lemon, it offers medium weight and body, with a crispness to the finish and a food-friendly nature."
Alma Sol,Tempranillo,86.0,34.0,1,"This wine offers notes of toasted vanilla bean, herbs and red fruit. It's broad in feel while the fruit flavors are elegant in style, with the supple feel bringing much of the enjoyment."
Alma de Cattleya,Pinot Noir,88.0,20.0,1,"Composed, complex and complete, this mellow wine is very comfortable in its skin. Touches of oak, tobacco, dried plum and cardamom fill the aroma, and ripe but not overripe black cherry, tamarind and cola flavors flood the palate, supported by fine-grained tannins and medium-full body."
AlmaTerra,Syrah,90.0,52.5,2,"With its distinctive black label, this reserve is set apart from the winery's expanding lineup of Pinots. It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit. Streaks of espresso, vanilla and chocolate come through, suggesting it will only improve with a hearty decant or additional bottle age. Drink now through the mid-2020s."
Almquist,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,32.0,1,"Sourced from the estate's original 1999 plantings, this is a chewy, majestic, earthy and deeply dark wine. Its black fruit is ribbed wtih iron, licorice, coffee and graphite notes and framed by earthy tannins that lend texture. It drinks bigger than its listed alcohol would suggest."
Almquist,Carmenère,89.0,30.0,1,"Always impressive in its grasp of power and grace, this white is memorable from start to finish, beginning with a dark golden-hay color that dazzles in the glass. A strong floral component of jasmine invites on the nose, while sparkling acidity maintains a freshness amidst the integrated oak and delicious flavors of honeyed pear and crème brûlée."
Almquist,Dolcetto,87.5,29.0,2,"Irresistably delicious and reminiscent of cru Burgundy, this laser-focused effort features bright Meyer lemon, tangerine and peach flavors, with plenty of juicy acidity. It grows deeper and richer as it breathes—and seems to disappear way too quickly once opened."
Almquist,Malbec,85.0,30.0,1,"This winery is earning a place among Oregon's best with its top tier wines, like this one. Complex and loaded with bee pollen, crisp apple, lime zest, seabreeze and toasted cracker notes, it leaves you breathless the longer it breathes."
Almquist,Merlot,86.0,28.0,2,"As characterful as the dry version but with lower alcohol and a slight hint of sweetness, this boasts powerful tangerine, quince and Meyer lemon fruit. Its electric acidity keeps it vivid and beautifully balanced. Delicious now, it's also cellar-worthy."
Almquist,Nebbiolo,86.0,30.0,1,"More tart than sweet, this delicious wine is packed with lemon drop, candied pineapple and tangerine fruit. The acidity is in perfect proportion with the slightly sweet palate, giving it a vivid mouthfeel that extends into the finish and offers versatility for food pairing."
Almquist,Petit Verdot,87.0,30.0,1,"Lighter in color, this wine is aromatic and expressive, with notes of fire pit, blood, black olive tapenade, sea salt, black pepper, cured meat, nori, crushed flowers and umami. The palate brings soft, lithe, focused notes of earth and savory flavors that shimmer on the salty finish. It's all about delicacy but the aroma and flavor expression is compelling. Give it some time in the cellar or decant."
Almquist,Pinot Gris,85.0,20.0,1,"From dry-farmed 40-year-old vines perched along the Rutherford Bench, this impressive offering is sanguine and elegantly balanced, a showcase of cranberry, raspberry and milk chocolate. Refined acidity contributes to an overall lightness, with dried herb and dust lingering on the finish."
Almquist,Red Blend,88.5,27.5,6,"Smoky, with bursts of sage and celery root, this is a wine that is unabashedly earthy, spicy, bold and juicy at its core. Light-bodied and delicate, the palate shows beautiful floral undertones. This is a complex and beguiling bottling that should hold well for years to come."
Almquist,Riesling,85.0,20.0,1,"The aromas of this wine leap from the glass, with notes of orange peel, potpourri, smoked meat, spice, fresh herb, stem, ash and plum. It's expressive, but still wound up. The flavors are focused, concentrated and savory, bringing a sense of intensity and richness but also lightness. The balance is exquisite."
Almquist,Sangiovese,90.0,30.0,2,"From a three-acre spot known to get a hearty dose of fog, this wine speaks to cool-climate character, unveiling crisp floral layers of dried sage and white pepper from the get-go. Those aspects are joined by rose, lavender and cranberry-rhubarb on the palate, finishing with subtle offerings of mushroom and forest floor."
Almquist,Shiraz,87.0,25.0,1,"From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular."
Almquist,Syrah,88.0,35.0,3,"This reserve-level wine from the Roserock vineyard, Domaine Drouhin's recent Eola-Amity Hills planting, is compelling. Dense and fragrant, it boasts a beguiling mix of rose, cocoa powder and Asian spice, like a magic carpet ride of flavor. A finishing note of chocolate-covered orange peel is the pièce de résistance."
Almquist,Tannat,86.0,30.0,1,"This super-smooth late harvest effort is perfectly balanced among sugar/alcohol/acid components. Lively and rich, it offers concentrated flavors of limoncello, apricot and candied peaches. Drink it chilled for best effect."
Almquist,Tempranillo,86.0,30.0,1,"With the scent of watermelon chapstick leading the way, this is a fruit-forward wine you want to kiss. Other aromas on the sweet-and-spicy nose include stewed plums and a dill-led herbal element. The flavors of red fruits and brown spice make for a completely delicious experience."
Almquist,Touriga Nacional,86.0,30.0,1,"There's a ying-yang of rich crème brûlée, lemon curd and toasted oak amid good acidity and fresh apple and pear fruit, with inviting aromas to boot. Creamy and crisp it'll serve well aside all manner of seafood, like fresh-caught trout."
Almquist,Zinfandel,85.5,29.0,2,"Boushey and Red Willow are the vineyards that contribute to this 100% varietal Cabernet Franc. There's excellent concentration to the brambly, bright, blackberry fruit, and some sharp acidity to underscore it. It's pure varietal and should continue to improve 2019–2021."
Alpha Omega,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,96.5,205.0,2,"Fresh, gushing fruit flavors such as raspberry, red cherry and boysenberry fill out this expressive and well-balanced wine. It is sweetly fruity in aroma, full-flavored, full-bodied, firm and dry in texture but not heavy. It craves ribs or wood-fired pizza."
Alpha Omega,Cabernet Sauvignon,97.29,250.0,7,"Distinct crushed lava rock aromas meet with dust, cinnamon, cola and Dr Pepper on this blend of 28% Syrah, 22% Grenache, 17% Cinsault, 17% Mourvèdre and 16% Carignane. Light red fruits of cranberry and slight strawberry show on the palate that dives into serious tannins quickly."
Alta,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,54.0,1,"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this is an aromatic offering, with notes of pineapple, kiwi, herbs and oak spices (40% barrel fermented). It's creamy in feel, but with tart, vibrant acidity that keeps the palate fresh and lively."
Alta,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,75.0,2,"Rich cherry and spicy black pepper introduce the nose to this wine from the Adelaida district. The flavors explore the more nuanced, not overly jammy side of the grape, with tart acidity and a good tannic backbone ensuring a long life. Decent now, but better to drink 2018–2022."
Alta Colina,G-S-M,92.33,44.0,3,"Red apple, spice and honey aromas lead to medium-sweet fruit flavors. It brings some appeal but the concentration doesn't seem all there."
Alta Colina,Marsanne,88.0,35.0,2,"This wine is an unusual blend of Touriga (38%), Tinto Cão (20%), Tempranillo (18%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Souzão. Alcohol aromas show prominently along with dark fruit. The fruit flavors seem dried out, juxtaposed by the sweetness of the wine, with the tannins having a real sense of grip."
Alta Colina,Petite Sirah,92.0,55.0,1,"This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored. Full bodied in style, it shows plenty of oak influence, aged in entirely French oak for 16 months, 42% of it new. Cranberry and sour cherry dominate in terms of fruit, with an underlying agenda of clove and tea."
Alta Colina,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,48.0,1,"This is a challenging mix of substantially puckering tannins and herbaceous notes, dotted in black peppercorns. The fruit is elusive."
Alta Colina,Syrah,92.4,46.0,5,An uncomplicated combination of red and black berry bramble with an overlay of coconut shavings provides a ripeness of fruit atop sweetened tannins and dull oak in this wine. It's made to be medium bodied and enjoyable now.
Alta Colina,Viognier,88.0,35.0,1,"This is spicy and sharp, with high-toned fruit flavors of berry and currant. Acids are strong and provide good focus, with a spicy/peppery note resonating through the finish."
Alta Maria,Pinot Noir,92.0,28.5,4,"In keeping with the winery's other red wine releases, the Cedarosa matches tart berry fruits to lush barrel flavors of butter and toast. It's approachable and somewhat monolithic."
Aluvé,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,48.0,1,"This wine is very good in a ripe, almost-sweet style. It smells and tastes like blackberry pie, has full fruit flavors and a smooth, rich texture without noticeable tannins."
Aluvé,Chardonnay,87.0,36.0,1,"There's a touch (17%) of new oak here, which adds flavors of caramel and vanilla to the rather tart and simple fruit. It falls into the generic yellow/green apple style, with hints of arugula."
Alyris,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,85.0,1,"Black in color, this heavy concentrated wine is thick in black pepper and clove, with underlying streaks of cedar. Well structured, it unfurls depths of black cherry, currant and vanilla as it develops in the glass, finishing a full bodied as it started."
Alyris,Chardonnay,87.0,45.0,1,"This blend works in commingling 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 4% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot, all from the producer's vineyard. Caramel sparks a richness against which herbal, woody tannins speak. The body expansive and full, and the finish awash in spicy clove."
Alyris,Zinfandel,92.0,35.0,1,"Dark purple flowers and tart boysenberry paste show on the nose of this intensely concentrated wine, alongside pencil shavings, bay lead and a lot of iron minerality. More bay leaf and pine needle show on the herbally full and texturally grippy palate, giving minty spice to the dark fruit flavors."
Alysian,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,20.0,1,"Complex and composed, this vineyard-designate wine is brightly decorated in flavors of grapefruit pith and lemon zest, with zippy acidity. As it develops in the glass, richer elements of peach and apricot flesh out the palate with succulent aplomb."
Alysian,Viognier,93.0,32.0,1,"From the Barton family's estate vineyard, this is a very dark Syrah with aromas of blackberry, balsamic, lavender and thyme flowers. There's a rich blueberry flavor at the core of the palate, where cocoa shavings, tense tannins and a lilac florals combine for a multi-layered wine."
Amador Cellars,Barbera,90.0,32.0,2,"Scott Sampler's experimentation with extra long macerations seem to imbue even more of a sense of place to his wines. In this case, that translates to very purple aromas of grape Jolly Ranchers, violet oil and warm black licorice. An exotic Indian-candy spice shows on the tip of the sip, leading into rich blueberry and fresh purple-flower flavors, with coffee and cocoa on the finish."
Amador Cellars,G-S-M,86.0,28.0,1,"Lilacs and wisteria combine for a floral and approachable nose in this clonal study, which is also loaded with clove, peppercorn, rosemary and elderberry aromas. It's soft and lush on the palate, with rich plum and black cherry flavors leveled by notes of anise, potpourri, fresh mint and Earl Grey tea."
Amador Cellars,Red Blend,87.0,18.0,1,"After three years en tirage, this well-evolved wine is heady and floral, made to highlight and celebrate diversity. Creamy and lush on the palate, it has a rounded richness of stone fruit. Made predominantly from Pinot Noir, it has an accentuated taste of strawberry shortcake."
Amador Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,86.0,32.0,1,"Dark gold in color, a strong note of apple skin gives way to tight acidity on the entry of this wine. As it develops in the glass, it becomes plush and fleshy, imparting complex elements of candied quince and orange blossom."
Amador Cellars,Sangiovese,89.0,24.0,2,"Marc Piro continued to hone his craft under Jim Clendenen at Au Bon Climat, and that expertise shows in this bottling, which combines Presqu'ile and Bien Nacido Vineyards to produce a wine that's both zesty in the underripe style yet full of fruit as well. Aromas of wild oregano, thyme, tapenade and red cherry lead into a palate full of tantalizing acidity, with tart Montmorency cherry, tangy tomato and fennel spice."
Amador Cellars,Zinfandel,87.0,31.67,3,"This elegant bottling by two service-industry veterans shows tons of potpourri, dried lavender, black raspberry and red plum on the nose. The flavors are quite broad and inviting, with hibiscus and ripe tomato meshing into juniper and clove. It's light in mouthfeel and weight, but well structured."
Amador Foothill Winery,Grenache,89.0,19.0,2,"Elegant and beautiful aromas of Montmorency cherry, tart orange peel and balsamic fig reduction sauce prove precise and show some mature vine age. Roasted fig flavors meet with salt and pepper seasonings on the palate, which is well structure and full of bright acidity."
Amador Foothill Winery,Sangiovese,86.0,18.0,1,"Extreme concentration combined with a velvety texture make this inky-dark wine made from Tannat and Dornfelder compelling to taste. The color is black with a thin ruby rim while black cherry, cedar and tobacco fill the aroma and crème de cassis meets espresso on the palate. The mouthfeel is polished as very fine-grained tannins blend with a rich viscosity."
Amador Foothill Winery,Zinfandel,88.0,18.5,4,"With a fruity exuberance of crisp cranberry and red cherry, this wine delights in touches of nuanced herb and earth. Light bodied and refreshing, it maintains elegant complexity and depth, a lovely example of site and winemaking."
Amalie Robert,Chardonnay,90.54,32.77,13,"Very roasted notes of coffee, warm leather, tobacco leaves, sagebrush and stewed blackberries show on the nose of this blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Grenache and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. The roasted quality carries through the sip, with more coffee and char tones alongside dried plums, crushed gravel and dusty tannins."
Amalie Robert,Pinot Noir,88.84,47.0,19,"This new project focusing on specific blocks of the historic Cambria Vineyard on the Santa Maria Bench starts with very subtle and restrained aromas of nectarine, lemon cream and a hint of grapefruit pith. The palate is fresh with lime and toasted coconut flavors, held up by a backbone of strong acid that keeps it from spilling toward overripe qualities."
Amalie Robert,Red Blend,88.0,25.0,2,"This superpremium effort from Precept Brands is loaded with fruit, and crafted with winemaker Charlie Hoppes' trademark style—lush oak, giving generous barrel flavors of butterscotch and toast. The barrel flavors dominate, complemented by bold black cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit."
Amalie Robert,Rosé,90.0,20.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, the blend also includes about one third Merlot and a splash of Syrah. Tight and somewhat reductive when first opened, it slowly unwraps into a substantial effort, dense with berry, cherry and cassis concentrate. Some not-quite-integrated green tannins remain, and the buttery finish also wants more bottle age. But a good effort overall."
Amalie Robert,Syrah,86.86,63.86,7,"Definitely a step up from the regular Chardonnay; this is more substantial, bringing in some mineral, citrus rind and spice along with apple and pear flavors."
Amalie Robert,Viognier,89.6,28.0,5,"Whoa... need... water. Michael David's Earthquake is all about impact, no bones about it. And this one won't disappoint people who like their wine like finely aged Scotch, high in alcohol. For them, its bold smoky chocolate, savory bacon on toast notes will be delightful."
Amavi,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,33.0,1,"This complex, flavorful wine walks on the wild side with a bit of funky barnyard in the aromas and flavors. It's dry, moderately tannic, rather light in body, and brings spicy black pepper, grilled beef and ripe plum flavors."
Amavi,Syrah,92.0,37.5,2,"Light, tart cherry fruit beckons for further exploration. The ripeness is there, and the wine comes across as clean and elegant in its modest proportions. As it breathes open there is a slight hint of volatility which, for most tasters, will be a plus."
Amavi,Sémillon,89.0,24.0,1,"This Zin speaks to compelling red fruit, plum and vanilla, with light oak presence. It's balanced yet still plenty big, showing off its well-worn roots within an historic vineyard. Before veering into syrupy territory, it pulls back, letting leathery cinnamon and black pepper have their say."
Ambassador Vineyard,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,35.0,1,"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, 8% Petite Sirah and 5% Cabernet Franc shows aromas of sweet plum, cherry jam, grape candy and chocolate spices. The palate presents a medium level of density, with flavors of Bing cherry, ollallieberry and dried oregano, thyme and marjoram."
Ambassador Vineyard,Cabernet Franc,87.0,75.0,1,"Floral, this medium-bodied white is creamy and touched by richer notions of pear, pineapple and vanilla, reflective of its warmer appellation in a warm year. French oak (40% of it new) aged the wine for under a year. With a touch of honeysuckle and nutmeg, the minerality is subtle."
Ambassador Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.14,55.86,7,"A bright, floral fragrance invites one to further explore this softly structured wine. It's layered with ripe red fruit, leather and pepper flavors that are carried into the finish by tight, grippy tannins."
Ambassador Vineyard,Grenache,87.67,36.0,3,"This lightly built wine is fully expressive, with floral aromas and bright layers of black cherry, peppery clove and toasted oak. Balanced and unhindered, it will work well at the table."
Ambassador Vineyard,Merlot,89.0,38.0,1,"Made from 100% estate grapes, this wine is shy in aroma but happily light and bright on the palate. It's delicate yet framed by firm tannins, showing blueberry and toasty oak flavors and nuanced acidity."
Ambassador Vineyard,Petit Verdot,86.0,75.0,1,"Tangy boysenberry and elderberry fruit shows on the nose of this sultry bottling, along with thyme, potpourri and licorice. The flavors are more cooked than fresh, recalling charred blackberry, dried blueberry, leather and licorice. It's a hearty wine that consumes the entire palate."
Ambassador Vineyard,Red Blend,88.0,39.0,5,"Woodsmoke, bramble and sharp raspberry sorbet aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend from winemaker Kevin Law and actress Challen Cates. Sour cranberry and tart plum skin flavors show on the palate, along with darker nutmeg-like spices."
Ambassador Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,22.0,1,"This perennially delicious blend brings together 53% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 12% Mourvèdre. It lets each variety speak, offering a structured expression of juicy strawberry, mint and balanced ripeness. Despite its nuances, it's not afraid to be bold."
Ambassador Vineyard,Syrah,87.86,35.43,7,"Damp chaparral, dried blueberry, beef and pencil lead scents show on the nose of this blend of 54% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 11% Mourvèdre. Rounded blueberry and black plum flavors meet loamy soil, anise, thyme and marjoram spice, with a savory touch of smoke."
Ambrose,Rosé,83.0,25.0,1,"This mix of 62% Pepper Bridge Vineyard Syrah and 38% Klipsun Vineyard Malbec has not entirely come together. The grapey fruit flavors and slightly stemmy tannins may ultimately complement each other, but that will require more bottle age. For the moment, give it a good decanting, or wait a couple more years before opening."
Amici,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.8,109.0,5,"This austere and lightly herbal Cabernet is balanced and varietal, but at first seems a bit dull, as if tasted through a screen. That said, it actually improved after 24 hours, with more presence to the tart red and black fruits. It's an elegant style that will probably show best with food."
Amici,Chardonnay,87.0,40.0,2,"Cola, black cherry and crushed purple flowers show on the nose of this bottling, one of the first reds to emerge from the 2014 vintage. It's light and energetic on the palate, with tangy cranberry juice and a touch of licorice."
Amici,Pinot Noir,89.5,42.5,4,"Rare to find on its own, as it's mainly used in sparkling-wine blends, this Pinot Meunier is earthy in dark truffle and herb, more savory, dry flavors that are wrapped in tightly woven tannins and oak. The muted fruit that's there recalls sweet raspberry."
Amity,Pinot Noir,86.62,33.25,8,"This is an unusual commingling of mostly Rhone varieties, a mix of 75% Viognier, 12% Roussanne and 12% Marsanne, with the addition of 3% Sémillon. Honeycomb and Nilla wafer rise from the nose before a medium-bodied swirl of sour lemon, grapefruit and yuzu give it tartness on the finish."
Amity,Riesling,86.0,20.0,1,"This big but balanced wine has melon and apple aromas, lots of fruit and toasty oak in the flavors, and a super-smooth and rich texture. The finish lingers."
Amity Vineyards,Pinot Noir,88.0,35.0,2,"The sixteenth edition of Dunham's benchmark Cabernet Sauvignon bears a strong scent of new oak—it's aged in 70% French and 30% American. The wood is dominant, which is not surprising in a wine built for long term aging. Given plenty of time to breathe, bright red fruits, citrusy acids and a lovely mix of toast, caramel and clove accents emerge."
Amity Vineyards,Riesling,91.0,20.0,1,"Richly aromatic, on the strength of the nose alone this could pass for something from Napa's Rutherford Bench. The blue and purple fruit notes and dusty tannins all say California, but the laser-like definition, minerality and natural acidity prove it's Washington fruit all the way. Strikingly dense and complex, with decades of life ahead."
Amizetta,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,75.0,1,"The 85% of Cabernet Sauvignon is upfront, with Syrah providing an accent. It's tightly wound, with notes of dusty cherry, sautéed herbs and spices, and tart cranberries supported by chewy, firm tannins that need time in the cellar to come into their own. Best after 2017."
Ammunition,Red Blend,89.0,20.0,1,"This brings bracing minerality into the forefront, in a terroir-driven wine with excellent penetration and depth. A fresh mix of citrus and stone, this elevates Viognier into the top echelons of Washington white wines."
Amor Fati,Chardonnay,90.0,60.0,1,"The 2010 Bello Rosso sticks to the 50-50 Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon formula, with a full, round, ripe and balanced palate. Fruity and forward, with citrus-accented cherry fruit, it pulls together the strengths of both grapes, with taut acidity and firm tannins."
Amor Fati,Grenache,91.0,60.0,1,"This sources grapes from the oldest (1972) blocks at Sagemoor, yielding a deep, rich and intense wine saturated with black cherry, cassis, licorice and barrel flavors. It's perfectly balanced, drinking beautifully, and fit for cellaring over a decade or longer."
Amor Fati,Syrah,91.5,60.0,2,"This is the first vintage for Upright—100% Klipsun Vineyard and 100% varietal Merlot. Thick and syrupy, it's a full throttle wine, with deep flavors of berry, cherry and cassis. Red licorice lightly streaks through the back end, and the wine makes a smooth landing on a strip of Bourbon barrel notes."
Ampelos,Grenache,90.0,36.0,2,"Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens. Rich and lavish on the palate, it has fine tannins that frame its blueberry, cassis and mocha flavors. It's firmly structured, with a lingering acidity."
Ampelos,Pinot Noir,89.17,36.67,6,"A partnership between the Delicato Family and country musician Zac Brown, this well-made wine shows a wealth of flavor and complexity, from dusty saddle and earth to black cherry and berry. Muscular and dense, it reveals plenty of underlying structure and grace, with a bright sprinkling of spicy pepper on the finish. Drink ideally between 2020 and 2023."
Ampelos,Syrah,90.0,27.8,5,"2014 proves another banner year for this delightful blend of Sémillon from Monte Rosso Vineyard, Muscadelle from Pagani Ranch and Palomino and Muscadelle from Saitone Ranch. High-toned in tart, refreshing acidity, it offers hints of vanilla biscuit with its lime, apple and melon flavors, lingering in memory for days."
Ampelos,Syrah-Grenache,87.67,28.0,3,"The winery's characteristic dense style is immediately apparent in this blend of 54% Syrah, 21% Mourvèdre, 16% Grenache and 9% Petite Sirah. It offers black licorice, smoked meat, baked black cherry and graphite aromas, needing time to breathe before unleashing black coffee, elderberry jam, asphalt and charcoal flavors through tarry tannins. Drink 2018–2028."
Ampelos,Viognier,92.0,25.0,1,"From a 22-acre site in the middle of the appellation, this is an impressive wine, softened by the addition of 6% Merlot. It boasts crushed rock, black currant and licorice flavors, with an attractive sanguine note. Pencil shavings, black pepper and cigar accents are present throughout."
Anaba,Chardonnay,92.0,36.57,7,"This wine from Rick Grimm and winemaker Paul Lato shows stunning potential for this new vineyard. Blackberry, thyme, black pepper and crushed slate aromas lead to a tremendously savory, umami-packed palate, where bay leaf and stewed mushroom notes envelop a core of blackberry and black currant fruit. The structure is solid, and the finish is long and strong."
Anaba,Grenache,90.0,28.0,1,"This is a standout, showing Napa Valley's true potential for the variety. Steely and light bodied in approach, it offers a lively complement of apricot and juicy green-apple flavors, finishing on a fresh fig note and feeling balanced and complete."
Anaba,Picpoul,90.0,28.0,1,"A top-of-the-line effort and a departure from the producer's single-vineyard, 100% varietal bottlings, this blends 4% Malbec and 3% Merlot. Spicy with clove scents, it showcases deep cassis and cranberry flavors, with a lift of red fruit and supportive acidity."
Anaba,Pinot Noir,90.2,46.4,5,"Plump but sour cranberry fruit aromas meet with sweet sandalwood, clove and forest floor on the nose of this San Francisco-made bottling from the historic property. Sanguine touches on the palate lead to raspberry, cherry, cinnamon and juniper flavors, ending in a menthol finish."
Anaba,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.5,31.5,2,"From an estate vineyard, this impressive wine is earthy with tobacco leaf and juicy cherry and cassis notes. Soft, supple and lengthy, it lingers on the palate as a well-integrated, balanced and beautifully crafted expression of the grape."
Anaba,Rhône-style White Blend,89.0,26.0,2,"Extremely luscious on the nose, this bottling is redolent of baked black cherries, vanilla, smoke and wet riverstones. That fruit-forward style carries over to the palate, with cherry pie and baking spice flavors, backed by a solid and an expertly balanced acidity that holds those rich flavors in check."
Anaba,Syrah,91.0,46.0,1,"This varietal Cabernet Sauvignon hails from the producer's organic Chiles Valley estate. It's muscular and lushly layered, with spicy leather and tobacco notes accented by a delicate touch of violet and supported by firm, grippy tannin. Drink now through 2033."
Anaba,Viognier,89.0,32.0,2,"The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit. It's concentrated and deep, with appealing purity of flavor and the structure to age for over a decade."
Analemma,Chardonnay,89.0,36.0,1,"The mysteriously named Inchinnan offers a flavorful mix of mint, berry, cherry, milk chocolate, Asian spice, cedar and cola. It's harmonious, with subtle power and excellent length."
Analemma,Gewürztraminer,89.0,27.0,4,"A huge step up from the previous vintage, this ripe, round and wonderfully fruity effort is a juicy, mineral-soaked bottle of joy. Luscious cherry fruit is topped with a dollop of butterscotch."
Analemma,Pinot Noir,90.25,43.0,4,"A new addition to Steven Kent's lineup of exemplary Cabernets, this is 100% Cabernet from Ghielmetti Vineyard, one of Kent's favorite pieces of Livermore ground. The wine is concentrated and rich, with heady notes of dark cherry, cinnamon and clove, plus a trace of mint hiding in the background. This will please fans of California and Bordeaux wines."
Anam Cara,Chardonnay,87.8,26.4,5,"A stunning Pirouette—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. A streak of iron and a hint of citrus keep the wine evolving through a long, beautifully balanced finish. Retasted after being open for 24 hours, the wine was as fresh and thrilling as on the first day."
Anam Cara,Pinot Noir,89.44,53.48,25,"Certainly the finest Grand Ciel Syrah to date, this is a full-flavored, complete wine, loaded with pure fruit flavors of berry and cassis. The details pile on—a whiff of stone, a hint of chocolate, suggestions of spice, all in perfect proportion."
Anam Cara,Riesling,89.0,22.0,6,"Waxy apple and lemon pith open this wine, followed by crisp, candied grapefruit. Robust, it finishes dry and balanced. The whole sums up into a full-bodied, rich and lush experience."
Ancestrale,Pinot Noir,92.0,25.0,1,"This wine is equal parts Syrah and Merlot (43% each), with the balance a smattering of other varieties. The coffee and berry aromas seem faint while the palate delivers all of the plush fruit flavors this vintage has to offer."
Ancestry,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.6,33.0,5,"Smoothness, complexity and a great price are the strong points of this medium-bodied wine. It has wonderful raspberry, cedar and red-cherry flavors, light tannins, a polished feel on the palate and lingering finish."
Ancestry,Chardonnay,87.0,25.0,1,"Perfumed aromas offer notes of white flowers, mineral and pink grapefruit. The flavors are dry and elegantly styled with a lingering finish. It will drink well at the dinner table."
Ancestry,Chenin Blanc,86.0,20.0,1,"The aromas of flowers and freshly cut pear, melon and starfruit are bright and fresh. This wine is dry and thick in feel with abundant citrus-rind flavors. There's enjoyment to be had but it gets bogged down in the middle."
Ancestry,Riesling,88.5,18.0,2,"A light earthy, toasted aroma and mostly savory rather than outright fruity flavors mark this medium-bodied, dry wine. The texture is smooth and rich enough to complete a good picture."
Ancestry,Sangiovese,88.0,25.0,1,"This is a neutral, papery white wine, with a flat, rather than lively mouthfeel. The apple flavored fruit is there, along with a touch of licorice, but the freshness seems to have been lost along the way."
Ancestry,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,18.0,1,"Roughly equal portions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot go into this tannic blend. It may be a little too far along the aging curve, at least for showing much fruit. It's drying out—displaying a touch of leather—and should be consumed as soon as possible."
Ancien,Pinot Noir,91.25,53.0,4,"This wine seems overtaken with scents and flavors of tree tar and resin. The impression of pine resin cuts out the fruit, leaving some woody flavors in the finish."
Ancient Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,28.0,1,"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year. Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills. Black cherry fruit is wrapped in woody tannins, a yin-yang combination that works by dissonance rather than harmony."
Ancient Cellars,Pinot Gris,87.67,18.0,3,"Coming from an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria, this cool-climate study offers aromas of blistered cherry tomatoes, Eastern European goulash spices and crushed peppercorns of all colors. It's fresh and lively on the palate, with hints of rose and tart raspberry. At the same time, it's quite vegetal, with green notes that will evolve into more balanced umami flavors from 2017 to 2022."
Ancient Cellars,Pinot Noir,87.0,30.0,2,"From a vineyard 1,700 feet above the small town of Corralitos comes this tasty wine that begins with aromas of smoked apple, lemon zest, honeysuckle and sea salt, as well as a struck-match element. The palate shows flavors of fresh apple, chamomile and a dusting of crushed vanilla, all set against a chalky grip."
Ancient Oak Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.67,75.0,3,"A blend of fruit sources used for the winery's three single-vineyard wines, this bottling saw no new oak and is light golden in color with reserved notes of mineral, almond, pineapple and lees. Full bodied, rich and layered with a creamy feel, it's appealing now but should have a long life ahead."
Ancient Oak Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,45.0,1,"This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight. It's fruit laden, focused and supple, with a feel that dazzles the senses and pure fruit flavors that just won't quit."
Ancient Oak Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,89.0,75.0,1,"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish."
Ancient Oak Cellars,Chardonnay,90.0,60.0,1,"Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time."
Ancient Oak Cellars,Pinot Noir,87.0,41.0,2,"This is an extremely rare beast—a single-vineyard, single-varietal (Pinot Noir), single-vintage sparkling wine. Aged sur lie for 42 months, it draws you into the glass with notes of smoke, raspberry, mineral and nutty spices. The flavors are light and lively with tart, racy acidity and a long, lingering finish."
Ancient Oak Cellars,Zinfandel,91.0,35.0,1,"A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin. It's not very tannic or astringent, but the body is so rich and the alcohol relatively high that it oozes power and concentration. This will be great after a meal with cheese or chocolate."
Ancient Peaks,Petit Verdot,91.0,36.0,1,"This barrel-fermented wine has opulent aromas of nougat, butterscotch and pear tart. Equally interesting flavors stress the spice and pastry notes rather than straightforward fruitiness. It is attractively rich in mouth feel, dry, full-bodied and grand in style."
Ancient Peaks,Red Blend,92.22,40.67,9,"This is a straightforward quaffer. Aromas of herbs, jasmine and stone fruit lead to sugary-sweet fruit flavors."
Ancient Peaks,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,15.0,1,"This wine is a field blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache from Bishop's vineyard. Aromas of herbs, berry, cumin and wet copper penny are followed by smooth-feeling dark berry flavors with a tart, mesquite-filled finish."
Ancient Roots,Red Blend,89.0,9.0,1,"All Merlot, this pale-pink wine offers aromas of herbs, grass and cherry. Though the label suggests otherwise, it drinks off dry, with pit-fruit flavors."
Andis,Barbera,90.33,26.67,3,"Dark, dry and puckering with a stewed plum aroma and flavor, this wine offers a depth of tannin and herbal notes. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot, it spent 20 months in French oak."
Andis,Cabernet Franc,88.5,26.5,2,"This Southern Rhône-style blend is roughly half Mourvèdre, 31% Grenache and 17% Cinsault. It's a delicious match-up, with the Mourvèdre underscoring the minerality, and providing grip and texture around the racy red berry flavors of the other two grapes. The wine has a spine of steel, suggesting it will age through 20206–2022."
Andis,Chenin Blanc,88.0,20.0,1,"Savory aromas and flavors combine with a soft texture in this full-bodied wine. It smells smoky and roasted, tastes like pomegranate and cherry juice and has a streak of acidity but not much tannin."
Andis,Meritage,90.0,32.5,2,"The Blanc de Noir name would suggest it's a sparkling wine; it is not. The label also reads Estate White Wine. It is not. Rather, it is a rosé of Pinot Noir, lightly orange in color. Flavors recall a Pop Tart sort of pastry, simple and slightly sweet."
Andis,Petite Sirah,89.0,32.0,1,"Vanilla and maple aromas lead to overtly fruity red cherry flavors with a touch of sweetness and a soft texture. It's pleasant to drink for those looking for a soft touch, with very mild acidity and no tannin to speak of."
Andis,Primitivo,90.0,25.0,2,"From the winery's estate Bell Mountain ranch, a stretch of vineyard that reaches through Alexander Valley to the Russian River Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Tight in cranberry and puckering oak, it needs to air before enjoying."
Andis,Red Blend,88.5,22.25,4,"With aromas like sweet vanilla and candied cherries, and similarly syrupy flavors, this might make a better after-dinner wine than a table wine. The acidity and tannins are very subdued, so the overt fruitiness and oaky sweetness take over."
Andis,Rosé,87.0,18.0,2,"An overpowering aroma of cured meat on the nose recalls walking into an Italian deli, something one associates more readily with Cal-Ital varieties. Super tannic on the palate, the wine is slightly bitter and perhaps underripe."
Andis,Roussanne-Viognier,89.0,20.0,1,"This GSM blend is soft and muted. It falls flat, with dull fruit and a wash of chocolate."
Andis,Sémillon,88.75,19.75,4,"A stunning Syrah with 4% Viognier that's almost black in color and aching with deep, dark cherry and black licorice surrounded by a lush, dense herb garden. This is a heavy, rich California Syrah, practically a velvet curtain, that will appeal to Rhône aficionados and anyone with a taste for something big, accentuated by a smoky finish."
Andis,White Blend,89.0,30.0,1,"Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato."
Andis,Zinfandel,87.75,25.0,4,"The Doyenne Métier generally drinks very well right out of the chute, and this 2009 is no exception. Supple and concentrated, this blend of 51% Grenache, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is an absolute riot of mixed berry fruit scents and flavors. Full, lush, dense and quite long in the finish, it's a spicy, brilliant bit of winemaking. Can it age? Undoubtedly. But good luck keeping your hands off it!"
Andretti,Chardonnay,90.0,53.0,1,"This ups the percentage of Cabernet to 60%, with 25% Syrah, 14% Petit Verdot and just 1% Cabernet Franc. Released almost a full year later than the other Long Shadows reds, it is well-integrated and focused, with high-toned black cherry fruit set in dusty tannins. Scents of sandalwood drift through, along with cocoa and spice. As good or even better than the outstanding 2006."
Andrew Januik,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.83,43.33,6,"An outstanding Hellion, 44% Primitivo, 31% Petite Sirah and 25% Zinfandel. It's a complete wine, with a full array of superbly rich berry fruits, a hint of chocolate and fine-grained tannins. Delicious right out of the bottle, but it could be cellared for at least another five years."
Andrew Murray,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,36.0,2,"This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more. Crisp and detailed, this offers a classy mix of citrus and apple, wet stone and light baking spices. Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish."
Andrew Murray,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,28.0,2,"There is a creamy, leesy mouthfeel to this estate-grown Riesling, whose residual sugar is masked with acidity. Tart apple and pear fruit flavors finish with lighter notes of candied orange and citrus."
Andrew Murray,Rosé,91.0,22.0,1,This is a rare beast from Washington—single vineyard Tempranillo aged in neutral oak coming in at less than 13% alcohol. It's soft and light with notes of red fruit and refreshing acidity that drops off on the back half.
Andrew Murray,Syrah,92.0,18.67,3,"Aged in 68% new French oak, the barrel notes take center stage here with aromas of toast and spice. The palate is creamy and full with a viscous feel, tapering in concentration toward the finish."
Andrew Rich,Gewürztraminer,88.0,28.0,1,"This is a fine, all-purpose red blend, mostly Cabernet, with time in one-third new French and American oak. Heavily charred, smoky and earthy, it's got a fair amount of dark cassis fruit to carry all the barrel toast and finishes with some notes of bark and stem."
Andrew Rich,Grenache,88.0,40.0,1,"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through."
Andrew Rich,Mourvèdre,88.0,40.0,2,"Sporting a much-improved label design, the 2009 Natasha brings pungent, assertive scents of tomato leaf, pepper and moist earth. Sharp and focused, the fruit is there, though it's the leaf and earth components that stand out. For its earthy style, it's a well-made and complex offering."
Andrew Rich,Pinot Noir,90.83,30.5,6,"This is the most complete of the four Prince Hill clonal selection bottlings. It has flavors of cherry, Dr. Pepper, cherry candy and a hint of incense. It's a pleasant, easy-drinking wine best consumed while still young."
Andrew Rich,Red Blend,90.0,22.0,2,"Despite its single-vineyard designation, this watery effort could be from anywhere. Thin, dilute, barely ripe strawberry fruit vanishes quickly once in the mouth, and there is little trace of any barrel flavors from aging in 20% new French oak."
Andrew Rich,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,45.0,1,"This is soft and easy in texture, light in flavors and slightly sweet. Light to medium bodied, it has very little tannin or astringency, is low in acidity and quiet on the finish."
Andrew Rich,Sauvignon Blanc,91.5,22.0,2,"Sourced from a single vineyard, this spent 17 months in French oak, 38% new. It's light and spicy, with pleasant fruit flavors of apple and pear."
Andrew Rich,Syrah,89.0,40.0,1,"Tangy berry/black cherry fruit is backed with lots of acid and hints of earthy funk. It's not vegetal but it is definitely herbal, a complex and flavorful reserve that falls right between Balboa's regular Syrah and the Sayulita."
Andrew Will,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.36,62.57,14,"Opulence is the reserve Syrah, a firm and juicy wine with dark, smoky, wild berry flavors. It's gamy and brambly, chewy and tart, and it has the length and polish to sustain your interest through glass after glass."
Andrew Will,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,50.5,4,"A nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blend—two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah—is becoming a classic in Walla Walla. This wraps delicious caramel around bright berries and plums. It's nicely focused, smooth and compact, but feels like a wine that will flesh out with a bit more bottle age."
Andrew Will,Red Blend,93.4,57.7,10,"This Cab/Merlot/Syrah blend is very much in a Washington style, with crisp acids and tart berry and currant flavors, wrapped in chocolate and showing a few specks of pepper, presumably from the Syrah. It's solid and well-made and a good example of how Oregon vintners are breaking out of the Pinot box."
Andrew Will,Sangiovese,89.0,23.67,3,"Tart and juicy, this nicely balanced Riesling mixes fruit flavors of orange, Meyer lemon and tangerine. The acids are natural and tangy, and the overall balance is just right."
Angel Vine,Petite Sirah,89.0,23.0,2,"A blend of approximately 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot making up the remainder, this barbecue-ready wine is scented with dried herb and forest floor components. Brambly berry fruit and tart acids work to balance out the earthy tannins."
Angel Vine,Primitivo,88.0,24.0,1,"This is 75% Merlot, with Cabernet, Malbec and Syrah comprising the other 25%. Despite all of the components, it tastes like there is a bit of a hole. The fruit is soft and plummy, and the overall balance is excellent."
Angel Vine,Red Blend,90.0,24.2,5,"Light aromas of red fruit, game and vanilla are followed by quite tart puckering fruit flavors. It needs food to counteract the screaming acid."
Angel Vine,Zinfandel,89.25,22.25,8,"This light-colored and light-bodied wine combines an earthy, metallic aroma with mildly fruity, candied flavors. Its texture is mild and smooth."
Angel's Cup,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,12.0,1,"The aromas are light, with notes of white flowers, green herbs and peach. The flavors are tart and elegant in style, seeming quite watery in concentration."
Angel's Cup,Chardonnay,85.0,12.0,1,"High-toned aromatics complement aggressive, unintegrated flavors of raw wood. It's lumber, not toast, that you taste, along with bitter tannins and little evidence of ripe fruit."
Angel's Cup,Pinot Grigio,88.0,12.0,1,"Strawberry and watermelon highlight a light, creamy palate of vanilla and lemon peel, the freshness maintained by moderate acidity."
Angel's Cup,Pinot Noir,86.0,12.0,1,"This 100% varietal wine brings lightly styled aromas of green grass, herb, snap pea and whiffs of green pepper. The palate is full bodied and textured, bringing a sense of richness but never losing its balance. It lingers on the finish."
Angeline,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,18.0,1,"Medium in build and lengthy with layers of flavor, this vineyard-designate offers a wealth of rhubarb, pomegranate, cherry and black tea, the background built around strong notions of forest floor."
Angeline,Chardonnay,86.0,14.0,1,"Don't let the playful label fool you, this is an impressive, dry wine. Big, very ripe and fruity, it also has a good grippy texture due to firm tannins and acidity that make it appetizing. The color is quite dark, and the black cherry, blackberry and raspberry flavors run deep."
Angeline,Merlot,86.0,15.0,1,"Slightly sour Meyer-lemon-pith aromas meet with honeysuckle and yellow pear on the nose of this bottling by veteran Bob Lindquist. There is a strong sizzle of acidity on the sip, where green-apple flavors meet with tart nectarine and lime-peel zip. It's very fresh and food-friendly."
Angeline,Pinot Noir,85.5,18.0,2,"Black-cherry-cola aromas along with lots of licorice and Dr Pepper spice show on the nose of this bottling from a relatively new winery in northeast Paso Robles. There is slight sweetness to the palate, with baked cherry and baking-spice flavors. Accents of dried blackberry, leather, dried meat and purple flower add complexity."
Angeline,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,15.0,1,"Boisterous blueberry, black cherry and black-currant aromas make for a hedonistic nose on this bottling that also offers a sultry line of cocoa, espresso and clove spice. The palate shows similar layering, from black-cherry compote to herbs to black olives, proving unique overall."
Angelo Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.25,80.0,4,"This wine is a unique in the state blend and features Cinsault (35%), Grenache (35%) and Mourvèdre. Pale peach in color with a slight bronze tinge, the aromas are light, with notes of strawberry, citrus zest and mineral. The flavors are dry, sleek and high acid. It's a perfect summer wine."
Angels & Cowboys,Red Blend,87.0,23.0,3,"Fresh-squeezed lemon and jalapeño open the bouquet of this wine, kosher-made in Berkeley by Covenant. With the right pairing, it'll sing, offering medium texture and a lengthy finish, the acidity balanced and in keeping with the fresh elements of tropical fruit and citrus."
Anglim,Mourvèdre,91.33,38.0,3,"Floral aromas like lilac and lavender, then dry and substantial flavors like blueberry and boysenberry give this full-bodied wine an interesting personality. It tastes well structured with acidity and tannins, so it's well balanced and has an appetizing sense of reserve that will be great at the table."
Anglim,Pinot Noir,90.0,42.0,1,"Rich aromas of black cherry, anise seeds and buttered violets greet the nose on this dense bottling of a grape that rarely gets solo treatment. The palate is tarry and grippy, with dried sour cherries, boysenberry, black pepper and tightly grained cedar flavors that approach pine sap."
Anglim,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.5,35.0,2,"This solidly good block selection shows shy aromas of dark red and purple fruit with a touch of earth and asphalt. The palate is tart and tight, with a bit of sagebrush nuance."
Anglim,Syrah,92.0,50.0,2,"A blend of predominantly Merlot and Syrah, this wine offers aromas of raspberries, herbs, plum and vanilla. The flavors are sweet, plump and juicy, delivering a lot of bang for the buck."
Anglim,Syrah-Mourvèdre,91.0,42.0,1,"With 58% Mourvèdre, 20% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 2% Counoise grapes from the dry-farmed, head-pruned Old Oak Vineyard (formerly Sheep Camp Creek), this wine shows dried black cherries, pencil lead, uncrushed cloves and nutmeg on the nose. The palate is flatter, with cooked cherries as well as other dried purple and red fruits."
Animale,Petite Sirah,91.0,26.0,1,"Concentrated in toasted marshmallow and juicy blackberry, this is a large, full-bodied wine marked by puckering tannins that still need time to resolve. Powerfully built, it's big on flavor and intensity, with vanilla on the finish."
Annabella,Pinot Noir,83.0,18.0,1,"Lime pith, sharp gray slate, steel and a warmer lemon-curd aroma show on the nose of this wine from a region between Morgan Hill and Gilroy. Apples and pear-skin bitterness mark the palate that grows riper through the sip."
Anne Amie,Pinot Noir,85.0,27.33,3,"The toast, freshly ground coffee, dark chocolate and cherry aromas pop. Plum and chocolate flavors are smooth in feel and linger on the finish."
Anthony Road,Chardonnay,83.0,12.0,1,"This meaty, oaky Sauvignon Blanc, with a trace of Semillon, is slightly bitter with grassy and lemony aromas and flavors coming to the fore."
Anthony Road,Red Blend,84.0,18.0,1,"The fruit scents explode from the glass, showing raspberries, blueberries, cherries and plums in profusion. There is more stuffing, especially apparent in the nose and also in the mouth, than in the winery's varietal blends. The back end of the wine suggests bread and chocolate, light hints of toasted almond and cinnamon spice."
Anthony Road,Riesling,83.0,16.0,1,"This big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State. There is a generous streak of vanilla cream, a soft and very buttery mouthfeel, yet the fruit has enough precision and focus that the wine does not lose definition. Delicious now, this is a wine to drink over the next three or four years."
Antica,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,110.0,1,"Lemon and herb aromas suggest a lean, crisp wine but the flavors are fairly ripe and the texture is rich and soft. Appley, floral and not at all tart, this is pleasant to sip."
Antica,Chardonnay,92.0,35.0,1,"This airy confection has aromas of lemon and vanilla, then almost sweet flavors of butterscotch and lemon cream on a fairly soft texture. It is light to medium bodied."
Antiquum Farm,Pinot Gris,91.2,24.8,5,"Herb, currant, vanilla and tire-rubber aromas are at the fore. The blackberry flavors drink off dry, sweetening toward the finish."
Antiquum Farm,Pinot Noir,92.0,58.67,6,"Perfumed in cinnamon-flowery aromatics, this well-valued Zin is softly spiced, lush and smooth, drinkable with black cherry flavor and plenty of personality."
Antler Hill,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,50.0,1,"Spicy red currant fruit comes up quickly, backed with the grape's signature accents of stem and earth. There's a residual flavor of slightly bitter tomato leaf."
AntoLin Cellars,Chardonnay,88.0,19.0,1,"This is the winery's Left-Bank-Bordeaux-style blend, three quarters Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a pleasing mix of red and black fruits, licorice, toast and smoke, and spent two and a half years in French oak, 60% new. The wine is quite tasty and drinking well, though the blend lacks focus."
AntoLin Cellars,Malbec,86.0,22.0,1,"Don't let the label mislead you; this is not a dessert wine. It's off-dry, with a pretty suite of lemon, orange and citrus peel flavors. A whiff of tea runs through the aromas, and a bit of lemon oil in the finish."
AntoLin Cellars,Riesling,89.5,14.0,2,"The top cuvée from Mercer Estates, this reserve is a Bordeaux-style blend based upon 64% Merlot, the rest a mix of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A firm entry introduces a solid mid-palate with a mix of black fruits, coffee and toast. The finish is clean and gentle, with moderate persistence."
Aperture,Cabernet Franc,94.0,95.0,1,"This young, stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay has a beery hoppiness to the aromas, leading into a tart, juicy and crisp palate of lime and grapefruit. The acids taste of wet stone, and that vivid minerality brings dimension and lift to the finish."
Aperture,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,85.0,1,"Quite sweet and quite delicious, this ripe and fruity wine has lots of black plum, dried cherry and raisin flavors, a soft texture and a lingering, berry-pie finish."
Apex,Grenache,87.0,40.0,1,"This late release sourced from several vineyards dating back to the 1970s and 1980s is thin on the palate, with tart plum, herb, orange peel and of pineapple hints. Low alcohol reflects the cool vintage."
Apex,Merlot,88.0,60.0,1,"Made in the style of a southern Rhône blend (half Viognier and one quarter each Marsanne and Roussanne), this is lightly lemony, with a bit more fat in the middle. None of the three grapes overpowers the others, but the flavors feel a bit generic. Though fermented in stainless steel, it's gold in color and shows some hints of toast."
Apex,Mourvèdre,88.0,40.0,1,"Exceptionally light, this acid-driven wine is all flowers and green apple, with just the slightest reach out to honeycomb-like texture and weight. It'll do well at the table in its unfussy approach and crispness."
Apex,Red Blend,87.75,15.75,4,"Tart and dry, this has a broad flavor that does not express much varietal specificity, with some notes of caramel and butter. Not yet knit together, this could improve significantly with further bottle age."
Apex,Riesling,91.0,20.0,1,"The Dion is a new entry in the long list of Erath single-vineyard wines. It doesn't show much in this difficult vintage. Short and intensely herbal, it has strong scents and flavors of tomato leaf, which override any hint of ripe fruit flavor."
Apex,Sémillon,87.0,16.5,2,"It's difficult to understand what this is trying to be. Pinot Gris can show some light blush color, but this wine is almost pink. The result is tannic and tart, with a rhubarb-like flavor."
Apolloni,Chardonnay,88.0,20.75,4,"Soft and sexy, this small-production Pinot is made from Swan-clone grapes exclusively, which provides an intriguing spiciness to the wine. Amid the spice is a brambly taste of blackberry and blueberry, layered and juicy on the palate, the tannins well-ingrained through the finish."
Apolloni,Muscat,90.0,35.0,1,"This very approachable and likable wine puts the typical dried-grass aromas atop stone fruit scents. The palate is very herb-tinged, with parsley, thyme and rosemary finding a nice symbiosis with the riper nectarine and melon flesh."
Apolloni,Pinot Blanc,86.0,15.0,1,"Supple and accessible, this Cabernet is bright in acidity and soft in tannins, yet amply structured. The palate is layered with flavors of cherry and cranberry, with a hit of nuanced oak on the finish."
Apolloni,Pinot Grigio,86.67,16.0,3,"There's an earthy intensity to this reserve wine, generous in oak and cedar notes with complicated, concentrated mix of plum, cherry and berry. Nonetheless, the wine intrigues and delights."
Apolloni,Pinot Gris,88.67,18.67,3,"This wine delivers on richness of flavor without being overwhelming or overdone. Refined in soft tannins and a core of expressive, juicy blue and black berry fruit, it is seductive and smoky on the finish, sourced mainly from vineyards in the Dry Creek Valley."
Apolloni,Pinot Noir,87.0,31.62,8,"Serious and concentrated, this is a big and bold wine packed with ripe fruit flavors and firm tannins. It smells oaky and smoky, tastes rich with blackberry and dark chocolate and feels appropriately astringent, dry and full-bodied. Drinkable now, it will be best after 2017."
Apolloni,Red Blend,86.0,27.0,1,"Cola, dark red fruit, black pepper and oak greet the nose on this blend of 77% Grenache, 19% Syrah and 4% Mourvèdre. The palate is quite structured with firm tannins that could use some mellowing, with flavors of roasted pork, blackberry and prevalent cedar."
Apolloni,Viognier,91.0,22.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Upland Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Double Canyon Petit Verdot (38%) and McKinley Springs Malbec. It's aromatically reserved, revealing fresh and dried herbs, green pepper, vanilla, cocoa and dark cherry. The dark fruit flavors show a very pretty combination of richness and restraint."
Apothic,Red Blend,86.75,14.0,4,"You'd swear this 100% varietal wine had some Viognier in it, but the orange-peel aromas and flavors are just a hallmark of Yakima Valley fruit. It also features abundant cranberry, mulberry, rose hip and savory notes. The supple feel with light meat accents is where this wine really shines, showing purity, texture and a lot of elegance. Those looking for big fruit, look elsewhere."
Apriori,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,75.0,1,"Aged for 30 months in French and American oak (90% new), this wine brings pleasing notes of café au lait, pencil lead, cashew and woodspice. Rich coffee and chocolate flavors are backed by a silky feel, with the wood playing prominent role."
Apriori,Pinot Noir,88.0,43.0,2,"This strikes a good balance between spicy oak, fruitiness and firm texture. It smells lightly spicy from oak barrels, and also fresh like red cherry and sweet plums. Rich and layered in feel, it finishes dry and full bodied. Not overblown, it has just the right mix of elements for the dinner table."
Apriori,Red Blend,88.0,28.0,1,"This energized white wine has a German accent. Aromas recall honey, honeysuckle, tart apple and pineapple, and the flavors are like orange zest—tart, crisp and slightly bitter in a good way. This blend of Kerner, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Bacchus grapes should be brilliant with rich shellfish. It was barrel-fermented in 60% new oak, which one can't so much taste as feel subtly."
Apriori,Rosé,88.0,24.0,2,"The color of decades-aged Chardonnay, medium-to-dark straw, this dessert wine is rich in toasted almonds and hazelnuts, with secondary flavors of baked apple and stone fruit. Mouthfillingly rich, it remains balanced and complex, lingering on the finish in baking spices."
Apsara,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.33,76.67,3,"Coming from one of the appellation's most consistent producers, this offers a tight, restrained nose of blackberry and licorice. It's also tight and bright on the palate, with refreshing flavors of black cherries and crushed rocks. An expert balance of tannins and acidity gives the mouth a clean wash."
Apsara,Sauvignon Blanc,87.75,26.0,4,"Extra dark in color, this has equally attention-getting dark chocolate and espresso aromas, rich black currant and blackberry flavors, and a firm, generously tannic texture. Although tempting to drink now, this will improve in complexity and smoothness through 2017."
Apsara,Syrah,86.0,37.5,2,"A fairly dark and dense nose of boysenberry and smashed graphite entertain the nose on this blend of 50% Syrah, 45% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre, which is named after San Jose-based winemaker Adam Comartin's daughter. The palate is very iron-driven and minerally, with more boysenberry fruit and some concentrated violets giving nuance."
Aquas,Sparkling Blend,83.0,12.0,1,"From a 10-acre site called Scopus farmed by Ulises Valdez, this wine is rich and golden in color, given time to barrel-ferment and develop layers of fulsome complexity. Oaky, it has weight and depth, veering into ripe tropical notes and vanilla as it develops in the glass."
Aratás,Petite Sirah,92.0,53.0,5,"Blackberries, violet and black-slate aromas mix with a bit of soy sauce on this blend of 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Mourvèdre and 18% Grenache, grown in what today is known as the San Miguel District of Paso Robles. Juicy flavors of black raspberry and licorice combine for an easy-quaffing palate."
Arbor Bench Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,48.0,1,"Syrah (51%) makes up most of this wine with the balance Merlot (35%), Cabernet Sauvignon (10%), Malbec (2%) and Petit Verdot. Vanilla, baking spice and plum aromas are followed by sweet blue-fruit flavors that go down easy."
Arbor Brook,Pinot Gris,90.0,20.0,4,The aromas of lime leaf and peach are bright and appealing. It drinks medium sweet with a finish that lingers.
Arbor Brook,Pinot Noir,90.13,46.13,15,"This Cabernet Franc (70%) and Merlot blend brings aromas of green herbs, dark chocolate, flowers and a mixture of red and black fruit. It's soft in feel with polished fruit and barrel flavors that linger."
Arbor Crest,Cabernet Franc,90.0,20.0,2,"The aromas offer barrel spices, toast, black licorice and red fruit while the palate brings dark fruit flavors with a grainy feel. The oak (100% new French) juts out a bit and overrides the fruit."
Arbor Crest,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.8,24.6,5,"The Nashville-based R.S. Lipman Company, formerly just a Tennessee distributor, comes west for this deal of a wine, with lime blossoms, pink grapefruit and Gala apple slices on the nose. The palate is clean, crisp and rounded with lime spritzer and green-apple flavors."
Arbor Crest,Chardonnay,87.6,18.0,5,"A blend of 58% Cabernet Sauvignon with 21% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Malbec and 3% Syrah, the Frog Prince offers juicy blackberry and cherry around dusty, softened tannins and oak. Approachable now, it finishes awash in dried herb."
Arbor Crest,Merlot,90.2,16.4,5,"A tight nose of boysenberry and pepper shows on this wine from a boutique, artistically labeled SoCal wine project by Ian Sergy and Zach Jarosz. The palate is light and texturally intriguing, with flavors of squeezed berries and crushed oregano, showing bright energy on the sip."
Arbor Crest,Petite Sirah,87.0,28.0,1,"Purple fruit aromas of blueberry, blackberry and boysenberry are given complexity with Indian spice, hot asphalt and beef char on the nose of this blend of 88% Syrah and 12% Grenache. The palate is full of crushed herbs, from oregano to thyme to marjoram, with just a tiny shred of cranberry fruit and lots of pine sap and even bell pepper."
Arbor Crest,Red Blend,92.0,45.0,1,"Sunflower-gold in color, this heady, hedonistic Chardonnay brims with aromas of toasted brioche, lemon and herb. Bright and completely balanced, it invites sip after sip until there simply is no more. Concentrated and complex it finishes dry, lingering in beautiful layers on the tongue."
Arbor Crest,Sangiovese,90.0,16.0,1,"Sourced from the best barrels made at the winery in 2013, this off-dry reserve checks in with roughly 30 g/L residual sugar, and plenty of acidity to more than balance it out. It's sweet, tart and sappy, with concentrated, juicy flavors of Meyer lemon, grapefruit and tangerine. It feels full-bodied and roundly fruity, then continues to extend itself with concentrated details of mineral and acid. A wine of exceptional power and length."
Arbor Crest,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,10.0,1,"Fresh in mouthwatering minerality, this is positively bright, balanced and layered in lingering notes of lemon curd, green apple and just-picked vanilla bean. It is a gloriously delicate wine that's named for one of Marimar's beloved Springer Spaniels, made from one block planted to a selection of the See clone."
Arbor Crest,Syrah,89.5,21.0,2,"The producer travels to Stagecoach Vineyard on Atlas Peak to source 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 38% Syrah and 7% Malbec, making for a softly layered wine with plenty of structure. Crisp red currant and plum dance around savory specks of cedar and toasty oak."
Arcadian,Chardonnay,93.0,50.0,1,"Nearly equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this dusty red also makes use of 26% Syrah, 3% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% unidentified as other. A straightforward wine, it's juicy in blackberry and chalky chocolate."
Arcadian,Pinot Noir,94.5,57.5,2,"A single vineyard expression from this winery's newish vineyard, this shows pressed purple flowers, deep blueberries and a touch of tar on the nose. The flavors are dense, dark and framed by strong tannins, with elderberry, pencil lead and deep lilac syrup gaining intrigue from white sage, white pepper and raw beef tones."
Arcadian,Syrah,93.0,45.0,1,"Lots of fresh apple flavors, a crisp balance and smooth mouthfeel make this light-bodied wine refreshing and fun to drink. It has some richness on the midpalate and finish, but basically keeps its lively, tangy personality going."
Archery Summit,Pinot Gris,92.8,48.0,5,"Sharp aromas of peach blossoms, honeyed nuts and lemon balm make for a fruity yet biting nose on this blend of 58% Grenache Blanc from Happy Canyon and 42% Viognier from San Luis Obispo County. Ripened stonefruit flavors are cut with a sizzle of acidity and warmth of sea salt and candied Meyer lemon on the palate."
Archery Summit,Pinot Noir,91.31,87.21,42,"A clear, light-bodied wine that's slightly reduced on the nose, this Spring Mountain site provides a tightness of black tea and cherry cola, with a leanness that's hard to miss. Leather, currant and baked bread add additional complexity and intrigue."
Archeus,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,54.0,1,"Simultaneously light yet earthy, this shows cherry pie, concentrated pomegranate, whole nutmeg, buttery crust and intriguing brown spices on the nose. There is a bit less action on the palate, but still plenty of tart cherries, tobacco and brown spice elements."
Archeus,Syrah,89.0,38.0,1,"Blueberry, grapeseed, leather, cigar box and concentrated lavender combine for an elegantly intriguing nose on this bottling from a winery between Morgan Hill and Gilroy. The palate is fresh and rather light, with plums, figs, crushed peppercorns and a forest floor/pine needle intrigue."
Archgate Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,15.0,1,"Fresh and tempting, this has a hot-pink color and flavors like watermelon and cherry. With medium body and even a light touch of tannin, it's more meaty than many rosés, so you can serve it with the meal as well as for an apéritif."
Archgate Cellars,Pinot Grigio,85.0,12.0,1,"Sanguine in cedar, pencil lead and tea, this wine's elegant opening gives way to ripe black fruit and thick, burly tannins. The finish is marked in vanilla oak and a taste of cigar."
Archgate Cellars,Zinfandel,88.0,15.0,1,"Lightly smoked stone fruit and apple blossoms greet the nose on this bottling of 50% Marsanne and 50% Grenache Blanc. The palate is much more interesting, with lemon sorbet and ripe apples clinging to a steely centerline that shows flashes of flint and gunmetal."
Archium,Grenache,89.33,42.0,3,"This long-aged blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Petite Sirah is plump on the oaky nose with condensed rose petal, chocolate cake and violet aromas. The palate starts with ripe black cherries but then settles into an asphalt-laden midpalate, finishing with chocolate-chip cookies and a graphite tension."
Archium,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.5,34.0,2,"Playful and nearly effervescent on the nose with lemon-lime soda notes and a sparkling pear-cider character, this bottling also shows aromas of pink grapefruit and pink lemonade sorbet. Tart lime and lemon verbena pop on the palate as does melon pith, with a slight herbal character on the finish."
Archium,Syrah,89.0,40.0,3,"This wine could be labeled a Cabernet Sauvignon, which makes up 83% of the blend, with the rest Merlot. The aromas of fruit leather, dried blackberry, black licorice and medicine cabinet are bright, though they seem considerably more evolved than the wine's age might indicate. The black-fruit flavors display a sense of balance that carries through the finish. Drink now."
Archium,Syrah-Grenache,91.0,34.0,1,"Aromas of blue and purple fruit mix with notes of dried thyme and black pepper. The flavors are tart and elegant, showing a good sense of balance and restraint, with a finish that lingers."
Archival,Chardonnay,91.0,32.0,1,"Half Cabernet with the rest Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot, this wine opens with aromas of sweet barrel spices followed by dried red and black fruit. The palate is fruit-forward and flavorful, bringing you back for another sip."
Archival,Petite Sirah,85.0,32.0,1,"Mourvèdre and Syrah each make up a third of this wine with the rest Grenache and Viognier. The latter (12%) shows itself prominently on the aromas, with perfumed notes of purple flowers and orange peel that are followed by purple fruit, vanilla, coffee and spice. The palate offers elegant, yet sweet and flavorful pomegranate and cranberry flavors with pleasing spice accents."
Arcudi,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,150.0,1,"A mountaintop vineyard in a cool year delivers the expected lighter elegance, offering a complicated and fascinating array of aromas, from incense and white pepper to patchouli and potpourri. The palate starts with sour cherries before the herbal lift of fennel and dill arrives, proving a light, curious and tasty wine."
Ardenvoir,Sémillon,93.0,22.0,1,"Merlot (55%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) make up the majority of this wine with the balance Malbec. Vanilla, barrel spice and dark-fruit aromas are followed by saturated black-fruit flavors that linger. The oak gets a bit out-front but the wine still has much to offer."
Ardiri,Pinot Noir,87.0,20.0,1,"Blue-fruit aromas intermingle with vanilla and other barrel spices. The coffee and plum flavors are full and supple in feel, followed by a tart finish. The wood seems a bit primary but the fruit and feel is still hard to ignore."
Ardiri,White Blend,87.0,21.0,1,"Bright aromas of freshly roasted coffee beans, brown stems, dried herbs, purple flowers, mineral and black pepper are followed by ethereally light fruit and savory flavors that focus on elegance. This wine provides plenty of interest but the finish seems a bit clipped. It might lengthen out with aging."
Ardor,Grenache,90.0,60.0,1,"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this warm-vintage wine seems aromatically quiet, with light aromas of funk, earth, red berries and coffee. Flavors are generous and ripe, with the alcohol occasionally poking out."
Ardor,Mourvèdre,90.4,34.4,5,"The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing. The stone-fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, pulling up ever so slightly on the finish."
Ardor,Rosé,89.0,19.0,2,"Examples of this variety are rare in the state. Aromas pop with heaping amounts of fresh flowers and orange peel that are reminiscent of freesia in their intensity. The coffee and blue-fruit flavors are smooth and sultry, showing pleasing depth."
Ardor,Syrah,91.71,50.71,14,"Single vineyard, 100% varietal Malbec can be spot on, and this succeeds with a balanced flavor profile of mixed berries and earthy tannins. There's a hint of volatility, that quickly blows off. Decanting for an hour or so is advised."
Ardor,White Blend,88.25,26.5,4,"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style."
Argot,Chardonnay,86.0,50.0,1,"This is a blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Willow and Dineen, respectively. Though it falls on the lighter side for Washington Syrah, it's proportionate and pleasing, with strawberry fruit, mocha and toast. Tannins are fine and slender; though drinking well now, this could be cellared for awhile longer."
Argot,Pinot Noir,89.25,51.25,4,"All black cherry and blueberry jam, this South Coast Syrah is fruity and spicy, full and fleshy with pepper and cinnamon spice and a teaspoon of black tea playfully showing through. Consistent throughout, a wine that's easy to like and complex at the same time. It spent close to two years in French oak, 30% of it new."
Argyle,Champagne Blend,88.0,32.5,2,"Broadly fruity, this dark and smooth Merlot is loaded with a luscious mix of black fruits. The flavors play out in forward, accessible fashion, flecked with a pleasing minerality."
Argyle,Chardonnay,89.86,29.71,7,"Spicy and bright, with an almost-too-ripe note to the fruit. Sweet ripe berries are joined by hints of sweet tomato and fecund, autumnal flavors, suggesting that this Syrah should be consumed sooner rather than later."
Argyle,Pinot Noir,88.85,48.31,13,"Conflict is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, and 8% Cabernet Franc. Smoke wreathes around deep cherry candy flavors, leading into some chewy tannins dusted with savory herbs."
Argyle,Riesling,89.0,26.0,3,"This lush Chardonnay has a certain oiliness to the aromas, along with dusty, toasty components that ride through a soft, plush mid-palate. The fruit is a rich mix of peach and apricot, highlighted with toasted hazelnuts, vanilla and coconut."
Argyle,Sparkling Blend,90.86,47.14,7,"This is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot and 3% Syrah. It's toasty to the max, with scents and flavors of coffee and smoke as much as berry and cassis. There is great acid/tannin balance and some additional years of bottle age should help to bring out more of the fruit."
Arista,Chardonnay,94.0,66.67,6,"This wine is mostly Sémillon, with Sauvignon Blanc filling in the rest. It's one of the rare white wines from the Walla Walla AVA, graceful, full-bodied and tasting of fig and green banana. Just recently bottled, it still carries a bit of yeast in the nose and in the finish. Give it another few months to pull itself together."
Arista,Pinot Noir,94.1,73.5,10,"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance of Merlot, Syrah and Malbec, is immediately accessible with notes of char, roasted coffee bean and cherry. The palate is rich, chocolaty and seamlessly stitched together."
Armanino Family Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,95.0,1,"In many ways, this is a fascinating sip, but the components are a bit confusing altogether. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper. It's a little too overpowering."
Armanino Family Cellars,Pinot Noir,86.83,55.0,6,"This medium-bodied wine is very fruity in aroma, and exudes ripe pear and fig flavors. Add in creamy vanilla accents and a very soft texture and the effect is almost sweet."
Armida,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,48.0,2,"This is a juicy and formidably tannic version of the variety, from a famed vineyard known also for Zinfandel. Dry oak and intrusively harsh texture need mellowing before the more gentle notions of dried herb and black cherry can shine."
Armida,Chardonnay,89.0,42.5,2,"Fermented entirely in stainless steel, this is a simple, tropically sweet wine, characterized by mango, pineapple and juicy melon."
Armida,Pinot Noir,87.5,47.5,4,"This full-bodied wine has earthy, woodsy aromas, ripe and mature fruit flavors and a broad, almost soft texture. It's very mouth-filling and smooth, and will please people who like a little rusticity in their wines."
Armida,Red Blend,91.0,48.0,2,"Rather vegetal aromas of jalapeño and bell pepper mix with red fruit on the nose of this bottling. Those same bell peppery notes carry through the palate, which is intriguing but will likely confuse many drinkers."
Armida,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,23.33,3,This is a simple representation of the variety: medium in acidity and weight and a roundness of appropriate apple and pear that finishes flat.
Armida,Zinfandel,90.25,47.0,8,This crisp Chardonnay has a disjointedness about it. Its aroma and flavor is most akin to Lemonheads candy.
Armitage,Pinot Noir,92.0,55.0,1,"This unusual wine offers aromas of nori, dried flowers, bittersweet chocolate and cherry cola. It's full flavored with a lightly tacky feel."
Armstrong Family,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.5,31.0,4,"Cherry, raspberry and vanilla combine for an inviting mix of ripeness and sweet bouquet. A fruity component also sits nicely atop this structured wine marked by soft, fine tannins. The finish is robust in black pepper and clove."
Armstrong Family,Cabernet Franc,87.5,30.0,2,"This wine displays generous aromas of white pepper, woodspice, raspberry and cherry. The flavors are elegant with a peppery finish."
Armstrong Family,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,32.0,1,"Robust and brawny, this substantial offering features concentrated layers of smoke, leather and sage-inflected tannins. It finishes in a wrapping of bittersweet chocolate."
Armstrong Family,Riesling,84.0,18.0,1,"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah shows a somewhat uneasy mix of woodspice, green herb and cherry aromas. Flavors are pleasant, lighter in style and easy drinking, with a refreshing finish."
Armstrong Family,Syrah,84.0,28.0,1,"This is Provence pink in color—light and just slightly shaded with copper. It smells floral and fruity, like watermelon, canteloupe and cucumber. The balance is on the sweet side, lending a softness in texture."
Armstrong Family,Viognier,87.0,22.0,1,"A 100% varietal wine, this opens in floral violet perfume, delicate notions that are soon overpowered by the chock-a-block blackberry and plum. The tannins are robust and still integrating, giving the wine a somewhat harsh feel."
Armstrong Family,White Blend,84.0,18.0,1,The flower and peach aromas are quite subdued for the variety. The stone-fruit flavors provide more generosity while still displaying elegance.
Arndt,Red Blend,88.0,32.0,1,"Dark in color, intense in fruit flavor and firmly packed with tannins, this blockbuster Bordeaux-style blend feels massive and grippy. It tastes like cranberry and blackberry, leaving astringency on the palate that will match up to the richest foods. Age a few bottles through 2019 to see how it matures."
Arndt,Zinfandel,90.0,34.0,1,"This wine is made in a ripe forward style, with lightly volatile aromas of apple, plum and dark raspberries. It's full bodied and pulls no punches as generous red and black-fruit flavors with cocoa accents show some warmth on the finish."
AronHill,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,54.0,1,"A mild current of cinnamon, clove and tobacco provide a spicy entry into this wine, backed up by a fruity mid-palate. Medium weight and body give it some power and substance, while on the finish, it comes under an herbaceous light."
AronHill,Primitivo,89.0,40.0,1,"One of the best Stoller Vineyard designates from anywhere, this bright and spicy effort is bursting with flavors of red currants, accented with smoky chocolate. Tannins are fine tuned and the wine has excellent balance throughout."
AronHill,Red Blend,85.0,43.0,2,"This is done in an open, palate-friendly style, with rich, generous black fruits accented with cocoa, coffee and caramel. There's a streak of vanilla custard also, and the fruit has enough depth and mass to hold up through a satisfying finish."
Array,Chardonnay,90.25,33.0,4,"A faint hint of pink shines on this sparkler named after the winery owners' dog. Aromas of fresh melon and slight peach lead to a faint cherry note upon sipping and creamy mouthfeel, followed by plum skin tartness and a yeasty, sour bitterness."
Arrowood,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,50.0,1,"Vibrantly fruity, it offers aromas of currant, raspberry, celery stalk and spice. The palate has tart cranberry flavors, finishing a bit short."
Arrowood,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,85.0,1,"Soft and supple, this has a heavy streak of spearmint and an herbal finish that also offers dark black cherry and ripe, leathery tannins."
Arrowood,Viognier,90.0,30.0,1,"This is a fairly light, bright Pinot Noir with the marks of a ripe year and time spent in oak. It is crafted under the guidelines of a certified sustainable grape growing program. Medium-bodied and juicy, it's fairly priced and ready to enjoy now."
Artesa,Cabernet Blend,91.0,75.0,1,"This vineyard has proven it can ripen good Malbec, but here it seems as if something has gone sideways. There is a gluey scent underneath the blackberry fruit, and the wine seems chalky and disjointed in the mouth, with more of the band-aid flavors in the finish."
Artesa,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,60.33,3,"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now. In the mouth it falls away quickly with a slightly oxidized character that suggests an early fade is on the way. It's gentle and drinks well enough right now, with some barrel notes of caramel and coffee beefing up the finish."
Artesa,Chardonnay,90.2,47.0,5,"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam. There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola. It's an interesting bottle that could develop further or fall off a cliff; it turns a little funky in the finish. More than 12,000 cases were made."
Artesa,Pinot Noir,90.0,62.5,6,"A light entry holds flavors of strawberry and tomato leaf, then turns tannic. Chewy and earthy, with more than a hint of seed and stem, this wine comes from biodynamically farmed grapes that add some earthy nuances, but put too much emphasis on green tea, stemmy flavors."
Artesa,Tempranillo,88.0,45.0,2,"This thick, concentrated wine offers complex notions of sandalwood and soapstone, savory in pleasant ways. Clove accents the warmth of strawberry compote laced in rhubarb."
Artesa,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,90.0,1,"An attractive, oaky perfume and melt-in-the-mouth fruit and dark-chocolate flavors make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. It has a luscious, mouth-coating texture, beautifully ripe blackberries and cherries, and a lingering finish."
Artezin,Zinfandel,90.0,30.5,2,"Although one of the cheaper Zins in the winery's line-up, it is showing the best right now, so drink up. Black cherry, licorice, smoked beef and a deep hibiscus note make for a very heady nose. There is a dense yet soft character to the well-structured palate, where strong flavors of blueberry, crushed slate, tobacco, leather and wild herbs make a tasty convergence."
Ascencion,Syrah,90.0,56.0,2,"This sensational effort was fermented and briefly aged in neutral oak. The striking package sets it apart from all other Rex Hill wines, and the rich, complex flavors add to the impression that this is something truly special. Red berries, blood orange, a touch of Grand Marnier, impressive body and spicy highlights all combine in a darn near irresistible rosé with the power to be a four season wine."
Ascension Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.5,60.0,2,"This rich, rewarding wine pleases in baked blueberry pie and a taste of raisin cake, its texture underlined in soft, integrated oak and a velvety density. Cinnamon, black pepper and toffee weave within the waves of ripeness."
Ascension Cellars,G-S-M,92.0,56.0,1,"The vineyard source for this tasty wine is farmed by a fifth-generation Japanese-American originally from California's Central Valley. Tightly wound in oak and tannin, it opens pleasantly to reveal a wealth of rose petals, earth and youthful ripe, dark cherry. With moderate acidity and body, it lingers on the palate."
Ascension Cellars,Primitivo,85.0,36.0,1,"A fresh-baked bread aroma and flavors like butter and baking spices make this full-bodied wine very attractive. It has ample acidity to balance the rich texture, and a lingering finish that completes the classic profile."
Ascension Cellars,Red Blend,91.0,66.0,1,"Pamplin's admirable focus on its pair of Bordeaux-style blends is rather rare. This is the more expensive of the two, and a fine, fat, forward bottling in this warm vintage. It's three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, with lovely fruit that's compact upon opening, fleshing out with air time. Clean, dense and focused, it is bright with berry and cassis flavors, plus subtle barrel notes."
Ascension Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,56.0,1,"This is pure single-vineyard Syrah, dark and tasting of cassis and blackberry, with a slightly briny, oyster-shell undercurrent. As it breathes, it displays a cured meat flavor, with a lively, citrusy finish accented by espresso."
Ascension Cellars,Rhône-style White Blend,86.25,38.0,4,"This Merlot-dominated blend features juicy berry flavors and tart, citrusy acids. It has gentle details of pepper, herb, lemon verbena and orange peel. It's a pleasure to see more elegant complexity in these latest Spring Valley reds."
Ascension Cellars,Rosé,88.0,32.0,1,"“Rhône times three” seems to be the code name for this classy blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah. It takes the best from each grape, creating a rich, pure, high-acid wine with a zingy berry flavor, plus a mineral underpinning and earthy, coffee-soaked tannins."
Ascension Cellars,Viognier,85.0,38.0,1,"Styled after the great white wines of Bordeaux, this is fresh and clean, with luscious mixed fruit flavors that emphasize apple and melon. A cooler vintage has produced a wine of low alcohol and real finesse, with a light dusting of toasty oak. Given its impeccable balance, it could be cellared for another 6–8 years."
Ascension Cellars,White Blend,85.0,36.0,1,"A blend of 58% Syrah, 38% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Mourvèdre, this combinins power with a big yum factor. Potent and rich, with woody, spicy highlights, the juicy fruit flavors favor blackberry and black cherry. A whiff of smoke runs through the finish."
Ash Hollow,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,20.0,1,"This wine offers perfumed aromas of clove, blue fruit, orange peel, toast and wild flowers. The flavors show restraint, with fruit and barrel flavors lingering on the finish."
Ash Hollow,Red Blend,86.0,18.0,1,"Aromas of raspberry and herb intermingle on the nose, which also shows a touch of reduction. The palate offers soft tart fruit flavors that provide appeal."
Ashan,Chardonnay,90.67,38.89,9,"Aromas of mineral, flowers and freshly cut green apple are followed by a just off-dry, lightly spritzy palate full of stone-fruit flavors."
Asuncion Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,91.0,58.0,1,"Warm yellow apple, light custard and white peach combine for a creamy nose on this bottling from the Riboli family's new estate vineyard. The sip starts with a sizzle of acidity and then shows flavors of caramelized green apples and a touch of banana, proving both a tad tart and a tad rich."
Asuncion Ridge,G-S-M,89.0,38.0,1,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec is a steal, offering a robust touch of char on the front end aromatically before unleashing bright red fruit and soft tannin. Ultimately light bodied, it retains just the right amount of grippy tannin to give it some bite."
Asuncion Ridge,Pinot Noir,92.25,54.75,4,"This perfumed expression of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot shows a great depth of complexity and deliciousness for the price. Firm, grippy tannin stars alongside dark cherry, currant, clove and tobacco, all along a softened layering of texture."
Asuncion Ridge,Red Blend,88.0,48.0,2,"The aromas are light, with notes of freshly cut apple and spice. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It shows a very pretty styling."
Asuncion Ridge,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.8,47.2,5,"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor."
Atalon,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,30.0,1,"Consistent year after year, this blend of 67% Sauvignon Blanc and 33% Sémillon is modeled after top-flight white Bordeaux. Deep gold, toasty and scented with olive oil, walnuts and loam, it hits the palate full-on with a rainbow of flavors: citrus, stone and tropical fruits, all accented with toast, oil and nuts from barrel aging. Riveting, delicious  and unique."
Atwater,Meritage,84.0,25.0,1,"Another stellar effort from this terrific new winery. Luscious aromas—stone fruits, candy, wax, peel, honey, cumin, allspice—it just keeps on going. Firm in the mouth, with the same exotic and refined blend of interesting spices and fruits. A tour de force."
Au Bon Climat,Chardonnay,93.0,33.33,3,"A super-structured, incredibly textured Syrah from the Sierra Foothills, this is Bill Easton's best of the best lots, aptly named Ascent, that he puts out every year to showcase his deft handling of age-worthy Syrah. This one will continue to develop its earthy, dusty, bacon fat and cigar box qualities over time. A truly beautiful bottle of wine."
Au Bon Climat,Pinot Noir,93.14,43.57,7,"Supple, dark, and laced with licorice, cassis, and clove, this well-crafted Bordeaux blend does not scream high alcohol, though it tops 14.6%. What keeps it focused and precise are the vivid acids and sculpted tannins. It's the work of a young winemaker who is improving dramatically with each new vintage, even as his vineyard puts out better and better fruit."
Au Bon Climat,White Blend,93.0,35.0,2,"This particular bottling belongs with the very best Syrahs from this Syrah-infatuated state. A broad, toasty, full-bodied and fully realized wine, it has begun to smooth out from the extra years in bottle, but has a long life ahead. Berries, cherries, chocolate, coffee, mocha, tobacco, fungus, graphite… the flavors go and go."
Au Contraire,Chardonnay,92.0,45.0,1,"Tapteil, Ciel and Cara Mia vineyard fruit, a blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 28% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Young and tight, with the characteristic Cadence chalk and stone undertone. The fruit is pretty strawberry, with a peppery herbal streak, good length and fine balance."
Aubichon Cellars,Pinot Gris,90.71,31.43,7,"The fruit flavors never get past light, tart cranberry in this wine, and there is an earthy tinge that runs through the palate and into the finish. It's thin and tannic in style."
Aubichon Cellars,Pinot Noir,91.09,50.0,11,"A scent of fusel oil mixes into this lightly fruity wine, along with citrus rind and hints of almond."
AuburnJames,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.4,57.2,5,"Coeur d'Alene Cellars does a fine job with Syrah. This has much the same satiny, sexy black fruit as the more expensive Opulence bottling, but it is more accessible and forward, with less power in the back end. Still, it's quite delicious, and the smoky tannins add some extra authority."
AuburnJames,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,125.0,1,"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mélange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating."
AuburnJames,Chardonnay,85.0,38.0,2,"At first this shows some earthy, volatile aromas. The mineral-driven palate has tart, slightly bitter fruit flavors, suggesting crabapple and wild berry."
AuburnJames,Pinot Noir,88.0,48.0,1,"This is an estate-grown blend of 61% Malbec, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Petit Verdot and 3% Syrah. It sizzles in a mix of huckleberry and blueberry, full-bodied and dusty in tannin. Its juicy and lifted by moderate acidity, with oaky accents of vanilla, nutmeg and clove."
AuburnJames,Red Blend,90.0,42.0,1,"First made during the Reagan-Gorbachev years, this blend of 74% Pinot Noir and 26% Chardonnay tastes of hazelnut torte and almond paste, offering richness interwoven with moderate acidity. On the lusherside of the sparkling spectrum, it offers a sweetness of peach, brown sugar and lemon meringue."
Auclair,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.33,37.67,12,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up over 70% of this blend with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It shows aromas of dark cherries, licorice and brooding black fruit that at times seems slightly dried out. The palate shows elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
Auclair,Bordeaux-style White Blend,87.0,18.0,2,"Full bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture. Having spent 15 months in French oak before bottling, it tastes a bit dense and muted at this point, and should be best after 2018."
Auclair,Cabernet Franc,91.0,42.0,1,"This wine is big in tannin, extracted and full bodied, with dense blueberry and maple syrup at its core. For fans of a rich style, it will impress for  its ripe, dark fruit and sizable yet velvety mouthfeel."
Auclair,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.5,50.0,2,"Golden caramelized oak supports a fleshy, full-bodied sensation of pear and fig in this bold, rich wine. Resolved on the palate and possessed of moderate acidity, it finishes in a plume of nutmeg."
Auclair,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,19.0,1,"Creamy, lush and somewhat robust, this dry sparkler offers a thick mousse and touch of richness in its mix of nutty bread dough, green apple, pear and lime."
August Briggs,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,55.0,1,"Sourced from dry farmed, organic vines planted in 1918, Carol Shelton's Monga is a mouthful of a wine, layered with cinnamon spice, blueberry, chocolate and oak, and still very concentrated and dry, with room to grow and mellow."
August Briggs,Charbono,90.0,38.0,1,"This fine-honed Chardonnay hews to the Eyrie house style. It may seem austere at first, but the green and yellow fruit flavors are ripe, not vegetal, and the firm acidity makes it a fine food match. Give it plenty of time to breathe before serving."
August Briggs,Chardonnay,88.0,32.0,1,"A blend of grapes from several vineyards, this is named for a famous jazz tune. The blending both softens and expands the mid-palate, and seems to have boosted the aging curve. It's ready to drink, with strawberry fruit, a dusting of cocoa, a hint of wet cement, and a finish with cola and sassafras."
August Briggs,Pinot Noir,90.0,40.0,2,"A mix of Sauvignon Blanc (77%) and Sémillon, this wine comes from three separate vineyards in the Columbia Valley. It shows plenty of Sauvignon's herbal character while also displaying the ripeness of the vintage, with lightly spritzy tropical fruit and fig flavors that possess a fleshy feel."
August Briggs,Zinfandel,90.0,35.0,1,"This wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with green, reedy aromas along with notes of cranberry and cherry Jolly Rancher. The full-bodied palate delivers more but seems disconnected with tart, tangy cranberry flavors."
August Ridge,Nebbiolo,90.0,26.0,1,"This lightly colored wine blends Grenache (43%), Syrah (32%) and Mourvèdre. It brings aromas of red raspberries, currant and flowers. The palate is fresh and lighter in style, with the emphasis on fruit."
August Ridge,Red Blend,88.0,40.0,2,"This tradition-bucking blend of 61% Chenin Blanc, 31% Viognier and 8% Roussanne offers soft aromas of sweet apple blossoms and peach, with a hint of barrel smoke. The palate offers a similar blend of peaches, pears and apples, warmed up with some oak influence."
August Truth,Chardonnay,90.0,32.0,1,"A strong oak influence dampens the varietal character in this full-bodied, spicy wine. It smells like cinnamon and cedar, tastes slightly sweet and smoky, is full bodied and rich in texture. Nice and smooth, it shows only mild varietal character."
August West,Chardonnay,91.0,38.67,3,"This is a substantial wine, concentrated in dark red berry color and flavor, from cherry to wild strawberry to more savory rhubarb compote. Muted on the nose, it has an underlying woody, herbal character that balances the vibrancy of the fruit."
August West,Pinot Noir,93.67,48.0,3,"Flavors of berry, vanilla and tar form around thick, rich tannins, giving this wine a puckering quality that may benefit from opening before enjoying. The finish is sturdy and robust in leathery black pepper."
Auriga,Sangiovese,86.0,20.0,1,"Grown in the southern section of the valley in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, this rare varietal bottling from this appellation shows aromas of cranberry, raspberry and citrus, along with some hints of oxidation. It's tart and full in feel, not seeming entirely varietally correct."
Austin Hope,G-S-M,95.0,75.0,1,"This is an aromatically brooding wine with notes of herbs, pepper and brown spices. It drinks quite sweet with a lightly chalky feel."
Austin Hope,Syrah,93.0,42.0,1,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this offers aromas of raisinated cherries, herbs, bittersweet chocolate and a whiff of barnyard. Medicinal flavors are backed by chalky tannins."
Authentique,Pinot Noir,89.5,46.5,2,"This wine made from Muscat Canelli grapes is slightly spritzy and sweet, pungent in apricot fuzz and grass, a mélange of tropical goodness from there on out. Mango, kiwi and pineapple fill the medium-weight waves of viscous texture, concluding in a vanilla-tinged, light, fresh finish."
Avaler,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,25.0,1,"This is 100% Syrah from an excellent vineyard. It's chewy and even a bit salty in the mouth, with a mix of bell pepper and black pepper over streaks of berry and cassis. Most of the flavor is front-loaded, and the wine fades away into an earthy, fairly tannic finish."
Avalon,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.5,16.5,2,"Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak."
Avant,Chardonnay,89.0,17.0,1,"There's pineapple and sharp dill on the nose of this wine from a Gilroy-based producer. Once sipped, apple cider and a tinge of petrol flavors emerge."
Avant,Red Blend,88.0,17.0,1,"Complicated, at times confusingly dank aromas of mushrooms, hops, dill and other wet herbs emerge from this bottling. Those atypical varietal characters find their way onto the palate as well, with olive and stewed mushrooms leading the way."
Avelina,Merlot,88.0,15.0,2,"Dusty in tannins and planky in wood, this chewy red blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec into a mouthful of black olive, black currant and leather."
Avelina,White Blend,83.0,10.0,1,"This is a rich, peppery and generously tannic and full-bodied expression of the grape, both powerful and brimming in grace. Soft and mellow on the midpalate, it builds up ripeness and texture toward the finish, ending with a satisfying bite of graham cracker and chocolate."
Avennia,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.71,52.14,7,"This full-bodied wine has a big impact on the palate due to smoky, meaty flavors, very firm tannins and an overall huge personality. It starts with aromas of charcoal and charred oak, goes to ripe, rich but not sweet fruit flavors, and finishes with all that grip as well as lingering smoky nuances."
Avennia,Red Blend,93.0,42.5,2,"Planted in 1965, these are the oldest examples of this variety in the country. Jason Lett showcases this special fruit in this natural wine with no sulfites added and no cold stabilization. Light gold in color, the crisp apple flavors are forward, the balance is spot on and the finish polished. Drink now through 2020."
Avennia,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,39.5,4,"In this inaugural release, winemaker James MacPhail travels to the far reaches of Annapolis to source grapes from the true wilderness, the site next door to Goldrock Ridge Vineyard. Made in a full-bodied style, this wine is intriguing in dried herb, black pepper and forest floor, with a healthy, lengthy seasoning of savory black tea."
Avennia,Sauvignon Blanc,89.67,27.0,3,"This bone-dry and floral wine will taste great with simple appetizers like toasted nuts or fresh cheeses. It is very well concentrated and has medium to full body. An opulent texture helps carry the floral, appley, grapefruity flavors into the finish."
Avennia,Syrah,91.86,47.14,7,"With a pronounced sensibility of caramelized apple and toasted brioche, this wine opens with a memorable lushness and richness that finds its balance in stony minerality. The highlights of flavor lean into golden pear compote and lemon zest, with a delicate seasoning of ginger."
Aver Family Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,45.0,1,"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah vineyards, this wine wins over fans by its brains rather than its brawn. High-toned aromas of dried herbs mix with notes of raspberry, blue fruit and iron. The flavors are fresh and layered, bringing a sense of vibrancy and deliciousness."
Aver Family Vineyards,Carignane,88.0,29.0,1,"From century-old vines, this wine is potent and focused, with powerful, ripe fruit flavors and a texture that feels polished and precise. The aromas favor black cherry and black pepper, the flavors are fresh and mouth-filling, and the wine has firm acidity and tannins that make the texture appetizing."
Aver Family Vineyards,Petite Sirah,89.33,51.33,3,"The winery's flagship wine, Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over half, with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Despite its age, it starts tight as a drum, with light aromas of spice, dark cherry, coffee and dried flowers. It's full flavored, with a dazzling richness to the textured fruit and barrel notes. Best after 2021."
Aver Family Vineyards,Red Blend,88.5,39.5,2,"From a different block of the same vineyard as the “Whale label” Memorista, this is drinking much better at the moment. It's smooth and supple—a pretty wine with honeyed minerality around fruit flavors of citrus and peaches."
Aver Family Vineyards,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,45.0,1,"The aromas jump up, with mesmerizing notes of fresh herbs, green olive, violets, orange peel, smoked meat and huckleberry. The palate shows a light but pillowy texture alongside flavors that carry on the finish. It's all about subtlety."
Aver Family Vineyards,Syrah,91.0,50.0,2,"From the producer's Old Vineyard Block, and blended with 20% Petite Sirah and 5% Syrah, this wine has a rustic barnyardy quality. It offers a tightness of dried herb around broad, sweet tannins, strawberry jam and chocolate."
Axis Mundi,Mourvèdre,87.0,20.0,1,"Meant to provide value, this wine also offers big oak, smoke and a bittersweet taste of black-tea tannins. Shy in fruit, this has a slightly reduced effect on the finish."
Ayoub,Pinot Noir,93.07,56.64,14,"Apple skin and guava rise out from a more buttery aroma that leads to oak on the palate. Light bodied, the wine finishes tart in lemon and lime."
B Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,79.0,1,"This somewhat indistinctive wine has a wealth of minty aroma on the nose, a characteristic that doesn't shake off on the palate, the body full and a touch hot."
B Cellars,Cabernet Blend,92.0,51.0,1,"There's something mushroomy and feral about this wine, which finishes with sour cherry."
B Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.14,123.29,7,"Balsamic aromas and strong pruney flavors combine for a heavy-handed taste in this full-bodied wine. It seems to be well-aged already, so drink it soon if you like this style."
B Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,93.0,65.0,2,"Aromas of blueberries, beef roast and fudge give way to a light, straightforward palate of purple fruit. It's a clean wine, but not very complex."
B Cellars,Chardonnay,91.5,54.5,4,"This wine also contains 25% Zinfandel and is wildly savage in herb, baked plum jam, tobacco and a strong arm of oak. Midpalate, it takes on more savory peppercorn and herb over fruit, finishing mildly."
B Cellars,Pinot Noir,93.5,68.0,2,"Similar to the winery's regular Pinot Noir, this is moving quickly along the aging curve. Hints of strawberry fruit are cloaked in barrel flavors of mocha and cracker. Drink soon."
B Cellars,Red Blend,92.0,72.0,2,"Red plum compote is at the center of this wine, a 100% varietal, with hearty bursts of herb and green pepper, as well as savory spice. From the cooler Coombsville appellation, it is soft, round and on the paler, thinner side of Napa's ripeness spectrum, more restrained."
B Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,38.0,1,"The inaugural vintage of this wine, named for a water goddess, this offers herb, grass, lemon and peach around a medium body influenced by some oak. As it develops in the glass, tropical fruit unfurls in a refreshing spritz before settling down to a tart finish."
B Cellars,Syrah,91.5,62.0,2,"The aromas are light, with notes of freshly cut apple and spice. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It shows a very pretty styling."
B Cellars,White Blend,92.5,39.0,2,"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor."
B. Leighton,Grenache,93.0,45.0,1,Aromas of vanilla and cocoa mix with red fruit. The fruit flavors are full and palate coating but the oak seems a little too intense at times.
B. Leighton,Petit Verdot,94.0,55.0,1,"Though a reserve bottling, this shows a very fresh and sprightly side of the grape rather than its dense face. Squeezed blackberries, just-picked thyme and a touch of burnt caramel show on the nose, while the palate offers Concord grape, boysenberry and iced-coffee flavors."
B. Leighton,Rhône-style Red Blend,94.0,45.0,1,"Candied black cherry and fresh boysenberry aromas meet with darker touches of soy, teriyaki and burnt caramel on the nose of this bottling. The palate is mineral-driven, with light tar, asphalt and peppercorn flavors leading into dusty elderberry fruit."
B. Leighton,Syrah,92.0,45.0,1,"Aromatics of rose and mint give this wine prettiness on the nose before getting into darker, richer components on the palate. Medium in build, it retains a sizable tannin presence in its youth, complemented by dark cherry and a char on the oak."
B.R. Cohn,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.25,28.75,4,"A mix of clones and vineyard sources, this is a bit rough and tumble, as the name might suggest. Hard cherry candy carries a touch of rubber, and some rugged tannins. That said, it's got plenty of punch and power."
B.R. Cohn,Chardonnay,87.25,25.0,4,"This is a very good, medium-bodied wine. It has lightly oaky aromas, lots of fruit flavor, a smooth texture and an almost-sweet finish."
BKB,Pinot Noir,90.0,35.0,2,"From a relatively cool site for the variety, this white shows an abundance of green olive and Meyer lemon. Moderate body and acidity allow for a touch of lemongrass spiciness and black licorice amid the textured mouthfeel and length."
Babcock,Chardonnay,92.4,45.0,5,"Nuances of vanilla and toasted baguette add flair to this full-bodied and textural wine. It has straightforward crisp apple and grapefruit flavors, a dry balance, and a taut, almost astringent finish."
Babcock,Grenache,91.0,18.5,2,"A fragrant start brings raspberries and rose petals, along with traces of Dr. Pepper and cinnamon spice. In the mouth the wine fades a bit, not showing the depth that the aromas seem to promise. Good flavors, just a little light."
Babcock,Pinot Gris,90.0,25.0,1,"A tannic Sierra Foothills Sangiovese that's plenty earthy, exhibiting swathes of licorice and berry too."
Babcock,Pinot Noir,93.3,60.0,10,"This frankly sweet sparkler smells like toasted almonds and pistachios, and tastes rich, round, floral and nutty. It has a good, fine bead, nice balance from the wine's acidity, and feels smooth and broad in texture."
Babcock,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,40.0,1,"Beautifully smooth, this medium-bodied and easy-drinking wine seems to melt in the mouth. Black cherry, blueberry and light smoky aromas segue to more cherry and chocolate flavors on the palate, where the texture is soft and appealing. It's a harmonious blend of Zinfandel, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah."
Babcock,Syrah,92.0,35.0,1,"Candied black cherry, crushed thyme, marjoram, peppercorn and smoked meat show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is very sweet, nearly treacly by sip two, showing concentrated strawberry juice and hoisin spice against a thick mouthfeel."
Bacigalupi,Chardonnay,90.0,56.0,1,"Soft, layered and reasonably complex, this red blend showcases juicy black cherry, cassis and a wealth of dried herb. A good value for the quality, it'll serve a gathering well, or do its job as a weekday wine."
Bacigalupi,Petite Sirah,90.0,44.0,2,"Strong scents of cola and chocolate come up quickly from the glass, and those flavors notes override the light strawberry and cherry fruit. With a bit of breathing time they all combine gracefully, crafting a full forward wine with a pleasing creamy texture."
Bacigalupi,Pinot Noir,90.0,65.0,1,"This is high-octane and boldly ripe wine from the wilds of Calistoga, offering bacon char, cranberry, plum and a richness of milk chocolate."
Bacigalupi,Zinfandel,91.0,48.0,1,"Soft, supple and floral, this wine is full-bodied and moderately structured, offering bold swathes of compost, sage and cola spice."
Bacio Divino,Cabernet Blend,92.0,100.0,1,"Bright aromas of raspberry, herb, cigar box and dried cranberry are followed by full-bodied cranberry and raspberry flavors. It delivers enjoyment but seems a bit dried out."
Bacio Divino,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,80.0,1,"Herbal in a shock of dusty sage and black tea, this is a layered, robust wine, deep in raspberry and vanilla flavor with a mineral-laden belly of stone. The finish is tannic and lengthy, showy in oak."
Bacio Divino,Chardonnay,91.0,50.0,1,"A field mix of seven varieties, this is a sanguine, thick and rich wine, softly layered in licorice, fig and cranberry, with a big presence on the palate. Dusty and leathery, it begs emphatically to be paired with pizza."
Bacio Divino,Pinot Noir,88.0,60.0,1,"This GSM pink wine offers very inviting notes of fresh watermelon, strawberry, pink rose and slight bubblegum on the nose. With ripe strawberry flavors and a slight orange bitterness toward the finish, this is a perfect wine for sunny afternoons and beach days, if the slightest bit sweet."
Bacio Divino,Red Blend,90.0,32.0,1,"A good sense of concentration and depth make this medium-bodied wine taste big and satisfying without overdoing it. It has a very dark color, fruity and lightly spicy aromas, rich plum and black cherry flavors and rather mild tannins."
Backstage Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,150.0,1,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced from one of Washington's most iconic vineyards, is aromatically appealing with barrel notes of toast, chocolate, and spice alongside earth and dark cherry. It's wound up at present with tart acids and tightly coiled tannins, showing impeccable restraint and elegance."
Badger Mountain,Chardonnay,86.5,10.0,2,"By far the best Dewpoint to date, this tastes bone dry, yet it's succulent, concentrated, and lightly honeyed. The deep flavors of ripe Meyer lemon and citrus just keep on going and going."
Baehner Fournier,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,42.0,1,"This single vineyard Malbec belongs with Washington's best. The mix of purple fruits and intense barrel flavors of clove, cocoa and dusty mocha inspires an impromptu “wow” once in the mouth. Smooth, satiny and seamless, it has a gentle hint of earth and herb threaded through the finish."
Baehner Fournier,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,34.0,1,"Gamay is still fairly rare in Oregon but ripens well into a style more reminiscent of Zinfandel or Grenache than of Beaujolais. Robust and fruity, this has tart and spicy cranberry and cherry notes, with a nice acid/tannin balance that keeps the flavors moving along nicely through the finish."
Baehner Fournier,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,25.0,1,"Very focused and deep aromas of boysenberry, violet, rose petal and anise make for a heady rich entry into this Grenache. There's a touch of caramel to the sip, where black cherry, clove, dried ginger and leather also show. It's a good example of how Grenache can ride the heavier side of the scale with style."
Baer,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.18,38.71,17,"This well-made blend aged in 20% new French oak showcases red fruit, with cracker, coffee and earth suggestions. A hint of alcoholic heat comes through on the finish."
Baer,Chardonnay,88.0,25.0,1,"At five years old, this is soft and supple, with well-integrated plum, cherry, spice and cola components. It's smooth and seamless and should be drunk soon."
Baer,Merlot,89.0,35.0,1,"From a biodynamically-farmed vineyard, this frames its cola and black cherry flavors with gravelly minerality The dark, earthy components come up through the finish, and the tannins have a slightly herbal edge from 10% whole-cluster fermentation."
Baer,Red Blend,89.83,35.33,6,"Pungent and spicy, with a sulfurous opening. Once the SO2 blows off, the minty, licorice flavors poke through."
Bailarin,Pinot Noir,93.0,48.0,1,"The new oak barrel flavors stick out aggressively, and help to create a strong impression of drying tannins. The fruit is light and chalky, with young vine flavors of generic red berries."
Baileyana,Chardonnay,91.5,28.5,4,"This southern Oregon Syrah has red-fruit aromas, with notes of perfume and plastic."
Baileyana,Pinot Noir,90.62,32.38,8,"Sagemoor's old Cab vines comprise 79% of the blend. The rest is a mix of Merlot, Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, melded into a deep and satisfying whole. Beautifully mixed cassis, berry and cherry fruits are dotted with dried herb. There is plenty of caramel and toast in the lingering finish, and this wine combines hedonistic power with depth and character."
Bailiwick,Cabernet Franc,90.0,28.0,2,"A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment."
Bailiwick,Pinot Noir,89.38,37.5,8,"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also."
Baily,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,35.0,1,"This has so much raw, rough oak flavor when first opened that the fruit is nearly invisible. Tempranillo may well have a real future in the Walla Walla Valley, but first it has to be freed from the woods. Give this plenty of breathing time."
Baily,Meritage,90.0,65.0,2,"Planted in 2001 above the Laguna de Santa Rosa near Sebastopol, Baranoff Vineyard is tightly spaced to mostly Calera-clone Pinot, providing the wine's bright raspberry and cherry overtones atop a layering of earth and spice. Thickly structured, it finishes with tart cherry."
Baily,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,90.0,23.0,1,"An amazingly vivid nose of cherry, eucalyptus and morning dew on wild fennel promises a stunning wine in this clonal combo from Morgan. The flavors aren't quite so mind-blowing, though, as basic fruit-punch elements meet with touches of peppercorn and nutmeg."
Baiocchi Wines,Grenache,91.0,39.0,3,"Warren Dutton planted the first vineyard block of this Russian River Valley producer, the Pinot a combination of Dijon and Pommard clones. In the hands of new winemaker Jerome Chéry, the wine is exotic in spicy cinnamon and cardamom, earthy and herbal with layers of dark cherry."
Baiocchi Wines,Grenache Blend,86.0,24.0,1,"Already drinking nicely, this offers generously ripened peach, candied lemon and pineapple fruits. The lush flavors are balanced against fresh, natural acidity, with little or no time in new oak apparent."
Baiocchi Wines,Grenache-Syrah,87.5,24.0,2,"Perfectly capturing the AVA's signature mix of herb, leaf, wild berry and white pepper in a compelling nose, this rolls into a full midpalate that is flush with tangy pie-cherry fruit. Some tasters may find it pushes a bit too far toward the herbal flavors. The overall balance is lovely."
Baiocchi Wines,Mourvèdre,92.0,39.0,1,"There is a strong underpinning of mineral in this wine, supporting crisply defined flavors of melon, pineapple and citrus peel. A medium-ripe, medium-weight, supremely well-crafted and balanced Roussanne."
Baiocchi Wines,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,24.0,1,"Soft and buttery, this medium-bodied Chardonnay smells like lemon meringue and tastes lightly sweet like marshmallows and bananas."
Baiocchi Wines,Rosé,90.0,18.0,1,"This is a sweeter and fruity take on the grape, beginning with a nose of fresh and vibrant boysenberry fruit and wet-asphalt minerality. The palate is tasty in a hedonistic way, but very primary, with flavors of fruit punch."
Baiocchi Wines,Syrah,91.0,48.0,1,"Now for something completely different. Wild strawberry leads the way aromatically on this lean, high-toned Cabernet, lower in alcohol than most of its peers. The fruit is tight and structured, the wine angular and soft, with a seasoning of herb on the finish."
Baiocchi Wines,Syrah-Grenache,91.0,39.0,1,"This was fermented from dried Barbera, Sangiovese and Nebbiolo grapes, concentrating the flavors yet retaining an elegant lightness that belies its high alcohol. Mixed fig, raisin, soy and chocolate components lend extra complexity. It's drinking well and is perfect for near-term consumption."
Baiocchi Wines,Syrah-Tempranillo,88.0,39.0,1,"Well-made in an opulent, hearty style, this vineyard-designated Chardonnay is barrel-rich and full-bodied. Floral on the nose, and tasting of oak, crème brûlée and vanilla extract on the palate."
Baiocchi Wines,Tempranillo,93.0,48.0,1,"This is all estate-grown from the original (2004) planting. Tannins are smooth and the wine has a pleasing chocolate streak upon entry. Peppery and herbal highlights come into play through the finish, which firms up nicely."
Baiocchi Wines,Tempranillo Blend,85.0,39.0,1,"There's a pleasant sweetness to the nose, a mix of white flowers and fragrant apples. On the palate, green banana, apple juice and papaya rise to the occasion. A strong minerality holds through the finish."
Baker & Brain,Chenin Blanc,91.0,24.0,1,"Vivid fruit flavors light up this extroverted Viognier, starting in the aroma and lasting through the long finish. It tastes like apricot, orange, pineapple, vanilla and cream. Good acidity keeps it lively and fresh, balancing the full body."
Baker & Brain,Grenache,91.0,35.0,1,"Spicy and assertive, this young, cellar-worthy Pinot Noir just hints at the complexity within. Give it plenty of air time and it opens aromatically with allspice, sandalwood, perhaps some cola and pine needle. The tart and tangy berry fruit is still compact and primary, but fully ripe and nicely sculpted into a well-defined wine from start to finish."
Baker & Brain,Grüner Veltliner,89.5,25.5,2,"A field blend ice wine—don't see that very often—it's full-bodied, almost lush, and packed with mixed slightly candied fruits—tropical, stone fruits and citrus. Concentrated and poised, it balances on fresh acidity. Just a hint of plastic in the back of the finish."
Baker & Brain,Pinot Noir,92.0,49.25,4,"A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style—grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss."
Baker & Brain,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,35.0,2,"Smooth as silk, all estate-grown, this classy Pinot lists five Dijon clones, Pommard, Wadenswil and “Suitcase clone La Tache” on its tech sheet. Vibrant and spicy, with cherries galore (sounds like a James Bond heroine) and a round, full, lush and satisfying mouthfeel. This is the one to drink now, while you cellar the Cuvée Giselle."
Baker & Brain,Syrah,94.0,40.0,2,"This red wine, named for the chef at the winery restaurant, is fruity and high-toned, with lots of cherry and berry flavor. All neutral oak, soft tannins, ready to drink."
Baker & Brain,Syrah-Grenache,92.0,35.0,1,"Barrel-fermented in neutral wood, this gives a quick whiff of buttered croissant, then dives into a moderately ripe palate with lime, pineapple and lemon rind. It's an all-purpose and appealing wine that is drinking nicely right now."
Baker Lane,Pinot Noir,92.0,37.5,2,"Thick, rich and ripe in vanilla, the American oak in this wine is pronounced and intense, wrapping itself around notes of candied apple and toffee-caramel."
Baker Lane,Syrah,92.0,37.5,4,"This is a tangy, not entirely varietal wine that's dense in black tea and black fruit, with layers of tobacco and dried herb. Give it time in the glass to open."
Balboa,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,45.0,1,"Law enforcement veteran-turned-winemaker Cindy Cosco named this brand for her Italian roots, and presents violet, red cherry and pencil-lead aromas in this bottling. A wild-herb character powers the palate, with bay leaf most prominent, followed by tart elderberries and orange-peel sourness. The grippy palate will open more with age."
Balboa,Malbec,89.0,34.0,1,"This Bordeaux-style blend is 25% Merlot, the rest an even split between Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Stiff, tannic and earthy, it delivers robust flavors of herb and bark more than ripe fruit. With its assertive tannins, it should stand up well to a grilled tri-tip."
Balboa,Merlot,87.33,23.33,3,"Lavender and lilac are just part of the floral bouquet that emerges from this wine, which also shows a blackberry vinaigrette element on the nose. Once sipped, it's like sucking on a purple-flower candy, with more lavender as well as plum and a pencil-lead edge that cuts through the palate."
Balboa,Red Blend,91.25,37.0,4,"This is a thick, rich and very ripe wine, with a charred back note making its way against higher-toned tastes of red raspberry and blackberry. The oak is integrated and the wine softly varietal, but it packs a punch on the palate."
Balboa,Roussanne,89.0,30.0,1,"Funky with prune and tobacco overwhelming any fresher fruit, this Livermore Zin is high in alcohol (15.8%), which coats the tongue for a long time after the wine goes down."
Balboa,Syrah,89.0,18.0,1,"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish."
Balboa,White Blend,88.0,22.0,1,"Light and fruity with pineapple, melon and apple. This fruit forward, food-friendly wine has natural acids and a delicate balance. For the money it is a fine choice to accompany seafood, poultry and pasta salads."
Baldacci,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.5,100.0,2,"This is very soft upon entry, with remnants of penetrating spicy and herbal flavors that might have punched up the intensity if they hadn't been somehow smoothed over. It's difficult to assess, because many of the right pieces are all here, but somehow they have not jelled. The wine tastes acidic and sharp, with pineapple and citrus dominating, and a chalky, tannic finish. Perhaps it's just a matter of time?"
Baldassari Family Wines,Syrah,90.0,32.0,1,"Roughly half stainless-fermented Sauvignon Blanc and half barrel-fermented Sémillon, this has noticeable sweetness that puts a sugary edge on the flavors. Pineapple and Meyer lemon fruits are round and full-bodied. This should be chilled to cut down some of the sugary flavors."
Balderdash,Syrah,85.0,45.0,1,"On the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge, the Celilo Vineyard is an exceptional site for Chardonnay. This was sourced from the 1983 planting, and the relatively old vines and cool vintage deliver a wine with excellent minerality, lift, drive and focus. The fruit is tangy and yellow/green, but perfectly ripe; the acid underpinning is fresh and lively. This has every chance of cellaring until 2024 or later."
Ballentine,Cabernet Franc,88.0,50.0,1,"The 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend adds extra muscle to this toasty, sleek wine. It's light but polished, with pretty scents and flavors of rose water and raspberries. The generous acidity of the grape keeps it lively and fresh."
Ballentine,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,85.0,1,"Aromas of cherry syrup, cola and cinnamon emerge from this bottling, which features artistic labels that always impress the eye. The palate shows dark red fruit and baking spice, as well as a minerality that combines rust and gravel."
Ballentine,Chenin Blanc,88.0,26.0,2,"The aromas are light with notes of herb, citrus and tropical fruit. The palate is a bit more generous, showing pleasing herb and tropical fruit notes accented by tart acidity."
Ballentine,Merlot,90.5,32.5,6,"Aromas of herb, pear, apple skin are followed by spritely fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
Ballentine,Petite Sirah,90.0,35.0,1,"Lemberger has become something of a signature variety for this winery. Aromas of orange peel, leather and red fruit are followed by plentiful Band-Aid and red-fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
Ballentine,White Blend,86.0,28.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Grenache (46%), Cinsault (31%) and Counoise. A very pretty pale peach color, it offers quite light aromas of strawberry and watermelon. The flavors are sleek and light, capped off by a tart finish."
Ballentine,Zinfandel,89.0,31.67,3,"Hot pink in color, this wine offer plentiful aromas of cherry and watermelon. It drinks off dry, with sugary sweet-fruit flavors that provide appeal."
Balletto,Chardonnay,90.19,29.38,16,"The oak is at the fore of the aromas, with notes of vanilla, toast and spice along with cream. The flavors are full bodied with a lightly creamy feel."
Balletto,Gewürztraminer,90.5,18.0,2,"One of the Chronic brothers' most beloved bottlings, this blend of 46% Syrah, 27% Grenache, 22% Petite Sirah, 3% Mourvèdre and 2% Tannat shows vibrant and fresh aromas of boysenberries, cola and lavender on the nose. It's easy to enjoy once sipped, with red currant, red plum and cranberry flavors gaining depth from oregano and marjoram herbs."
Balletto,Pinot Gris,90.67,18.0,3,"Crisp in citrus, with noticeable tension that softens in the glass, this wine offers tremendous value and elegance. Medium bodied and well integrated in terms of oak and power, it has a lovely note of preserved lemon on the finish."
Balletto,Pinot Noir,89.92,38.0,26,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, this wine is aromatically brooding, with notes of pencil lead, barrel spice, herb, medicine cabinet and cherry. The flavors are rich and full bodied, showing concentration and depth."
Balletto,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,19.0,1,"This is a nicely blended mix of 37% Zinfandel with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. The kitchen-sink effort rewards in juicy red fruit, herbal, cedar accents and medium-bodied weight and tannin strength. The finish is lengthy in vanilla and smoke."
Balletto,Sparkling Blend,91.33,42.0,3,"Like a genie released from the bottle, this wine rises up with aromas of violets, herbs, cranberry and bittersweet chocolate. The palate has tart, vibrant acidity along with a silky feel with little apparent new-oak influence to interfere with the fruit and savory flavors. It's a pretty wine that needs to be paired with food to be fully appreciated."
Balletto,Syrah,88.0,28.0,1,"Knights Valley continues to be a fine spot for this variety, as evidenced by this wine, which is extremely vibrant in grassy lemon zest and melon. A pure expression of the grape, it offers enough oomph to remain consistent and textured, ending with a succulent suggestion of apricot."
Balletto,Zinfandel,88.0,24.0,2,"Here is a hefty, concentrated, satisfying wine to pair with big proteins. A dense red-black color, with aromas of blackberry jam and dried plums lead to bold fruit flavors, full body and a thick, nicely tannic texture. The intense plum and blackberry character lasts through the lingering finish."
Balverne,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,33.0,1,"Leather and cooked meats open the nose of this wine from Southern California that also shows aromas of blackberry extract. Once sipped, it offers dark and dense flavors of sweet tar, concentrated violets and a pinch of lavender, all held together by grippy tannins."
Balverne,Chardonnay,86.67,27.33,3,"Several varieties figure into this blend, from 26% Zinfandel and 21% Syrah to smaller amounts of Merlot, Petite Sirah, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Big and powerful in smoky leather and black currant, it offers a rich softness on the palate, with a tightly wound savory, peppery aspect to the finish."
Balverne,Pinot Noir,86.0,40.0,1,"Herb, dark raspberry and flower aromas take the lead on this young wine that saw just five months on neutral French oak. The cherry flavors are plush in feel, lingering on the finish. It's a very understated wine that appeals to the senses."
Barbed Wire,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,14.0,1,"A 60% majority of Zinfandel plays nicely with 40% Petite Sirah, blending into a happy union of big, ripe blackberry and thick tannins. Smooth on the palate, with a touch of vanilla, it highlights red and black fruit in complementary waves, staying juicy throughout."
Barbed Wire,Red Blend,90.0,14.0,1,"This powerful blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc by longtime urban winemaker Benjamin Silver comes together in a big way. Aromas recall rosemary-crusted beef, boysenberry, sweet tar and, thanks to the oak-aging, both caramel and vanilla. The rich palate shows black cherry, black raspberry and a pinch of tarragon."
Barber,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,22.0,1,"This wine makes a big impression with wild, earthy aromas and dense, fruit-laden flavors. It blends ripe plum, smoke, tart blackberry and rich black cherry notes on a base of firm tannins and fresh acidity. These are rich, complex and carry through to the lingering finish. It's made from 85% Mourvèdre, plus Syrah, Grenache and Counoise."
Barber,Zinfandel,86.0,26.5,2,"Just-cracked, yeasty sourdough bread and dried lemon-skin aromas float off of this bottle-aged sparkler from an esteemed, longtime producer. Her winemaker son named this wine in honor of her birth year. An oxidative warmth gives bready depth to the palate, which shows lots of toast and lemon marmalade flavors."
Barbieri,Grenache,93.0,48.0,2,"Cocoa, vanilla and baking spice aromas lead off this wine, along with plum. On the palate rich, textured dark fruit flavors intermingle with barrel spices. The fruit and oak have equal footing."
Barbieri,Syrah,92.0,45.92,13,"Mint and tarragon come to the fore aromatically in this vineyard-designate, a soft, approachable mix of juicy plum, red berry and chocolate. Fuller in style and ripe, it'll do well on a table of grilled and roasted fare, finishing with a kick of black pepper."
Barden,White Blend,92.33,36.0,3,"Similar to the winery's regular Pinot Noir, this is moving quickly along the aging curve. Hints of strawberry fruit are cloaked in barrel flavors of mocha and cracker. Drink soon."
Barefoot Bubbly,Sparkling Blend,86.0,10.0,1,"Red plum compote is at the center of this wine, a 100% varietal, with hearty bursts of herb and green pepper, as well as savory spice. From the cooler Coombsville appellation, it is soft, round and on the paler, thinner side of Napa's ripeness spectrum, more restrained."
Barefoot Cellars,Pinot Noir,86.0,15.0,1,"The inaugural vintage of this wine, named for a water goddess, this offers herb, grass, lemon and peach around a medium body influenced by some oak. As it develops in the glass, tropical fruit unfurls in a refreshing spritz before settling down to a tart finish."
Bargetto,Chardonnay,90.75,30.0,4,"Cranberry and strawberry rise to the top of this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend in terms of aroma and flavor, the color and weight of the wine light ruby red. Dry tannin and herb intermingle around a soft texture before becoming puckering on the finish. Small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc are within the blend."
Bargetto,Merlot,90.0,40.0,1,"Jammy and ripe, this is a concentrated, extracted wine rich in blackberry and plum. Approachable, it offers a kick of heat and black pepper on the finish."
Bargetto,Nebbiolo,89.0,40.0,1,"This wine has been in bottle a while, perhaps to round out its flavors components, which tend toward candied cherry and spice. Aged in American oak, the tannins remain tight-grained and the aromas focused, but the wine falls somewhat flat on the finish."
Bargetto,Pinot Noir,92.3,44.0,10,"From Charlie Chenoweth's own vineyard site comes this tiny-production white, thickly textured in caramelized apple and pear with an oaky imprint at first. Dense and intense, it takes time to unwind in the glass to show more nuanced aspects of corn mash and clove."
Bargetto,Red Blend,92.0,60.0,2,"Shy and reserved on the nose, this wine is invitingly smooth and velvety in texture, with an intensity at its core. Anise, black tea, rose petals and cherry pie all figure in, with a juicy succulence making it pleasurable from first sip to last drop."
Bargetto,Zinfandel,83.0,20.0,1,"This wine combines 42% Merlot with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Malbec and 5% Cabernet Franc. It is inviting in juicy red berry and currant, with accents of lavender and herb. Full figured, it offers additionally compelling layers of subtle spice before a focused finish."
Barking Frog,Barbera,86.0,32.0,1,"An almost sweet oakiness rounds the corners of this full-bodied, lavishly flavorful wine. It wafts vanilla and chocolate in the aromas, ripe black cherry and dark chocolate on the palate, and a lingering baking-spice character on the finish."
Barlow,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,50.0,1,"Vivid, tangy cherry and raspberry flavors practically light up this medium-bodied, polished and complex wine. It pours out red cherry, cranberry and raspberry in refreshing bursts with each sip, with a lightly astringent, lip-smacking finish."
Barlow,Merlot,86.0,35.0,1,"This medium-bodied wine walks its own path, smelling like flowers, honey and ripe peaches. It tastes fresh, nicely tart, lightly tannic and floral, making for an adventurous and energizing path to take."
Barnard Griffin,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,60.0,1,"Deep and concentrated, this full-bodied wine has a noticeably dark color, big aromatics like cedar, black cherries and tobacco, and mouthfilling flavors that combine savory, peppery elements with very ripe fruit. It is rich enough to coat the mouth and linger on the finish."
Barnard Griffin,Cabernet Merlot,84.0,14.0,1,"A very agreeable, satisfying blend of ripe fruit and firm texture makes this full-bodied wine a winner. It has enough concentration to drench the palate with blackberries and linger on the finish with cinnamon accents."
Barnard Griffin,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.67,24.67,3,"This proprietary red combines equal portions of Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah with smaller amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. Altogether, they form soft, spicy waves of full-bodied flavor, showing off characteristics of leather, black pepper and clove, with the tannins intrusive and lengthy."
Barnard Griffin,Pinot Gris,87.0,13.0,1,"Strawberries, red currants and root beer come out at first, with cherry soda bringing up the rear. This forward, fresh and fruity wine is drinking well right now, and should be consumed through 2019."
Barnard Griffin,Sangiovese,90.0,12.0,2,"This chocolatey sexy wine tastes of cherries and sandalwood, with a strong dark chocolate note. A hint of pine needles comes out in the bouquet, and although it's already drinking well, it will surely improve with a few more years of bottle age."
Barnard Griffin,Sauvignon Blanc,87.67,10.33,3,"Bright red fruits like raspberries and cherries light up the aromas and flavors of this deeply colored, nicely concentrated and velvet-textured wine. It has great fruit that wells up, fills the mouth with flavor and then hangs on for a long finish."
Barnard Griffin,White Blend,89.0,9.0,1,"Baked black plum, dark strawberry and baking spice show on the well-integrated and elegant nose of this bottling by New Zealand-raised winemaker Fintan du Fresne. A chalky mouthfeel carries forth flavors of bright boysenberry fruit, loam and more brown spice, elements that are sure to gather more power with extended bottle age."
Barnard Griffin,Zinfandel,87.0,25.0,1,"From a vineyard that's actually west of the already coastal Sta. Rita Hills, this wine offers rounded red fruits of strawberry, plum and even watermelon on the nose, along with cinnamon and graphite touches. The palate combines cherries, hibiscus, rose petals and tangy cranberry, sailing through herbal touches into a dried mint flavor that carries deep into the finish."
Barnett,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,135.0,2,"This wine is a blend of fruit from Bacchus, Phinny Hill and Loess vineyards. Brooding aromas of black cherry, herb and barrel spice are followed by pitch-black blackberry and game flavors, backed by tightly coiled tannins. It comes off as a bit richer than the norm for this winery but still delivers the goods. Best after 2022."
Barnett,Pinot Noir,90.0,45.0,1,"This juicy wine feels substantial, with a concentrated palate of blueberry and blackberry fruit. It's got grip and detail, with threads of coffee grounds and smoke. It finishes with a hint of metallic earth. All is in balance, and the highlights are gently applied."
Baron Cooper,Zinfandel,83.0,32.0,1,"This full-bodied, quite ripe red has a classical edge in its grip of pencil led, black currant and dense blackberry fruit. Despite its heft and youthful tannins, it shows promise of aging in its backbone of structure and subtle grace. Enjoy best 2023 through 2028."
Baron Herzog,Zinfandel,80.0,13.0,1,"This bottling exhibits all of the classic aromas expected from Nebbiolo: tar, rose, dried cherry, sandalwood and cola. The palate offers much of the same, with dried mulberry and rooibos tea touches. The acidity is strong and the tannins are polished but still very structural. Drink now–2023."
Barons,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.5,22.0,2,"Cinnamon red hots and a depth of forested pine greet the nose in this compelling, medium-bodied wine, which is wholly exotic in approach. Asian spice and a nutty character form flavor and texture amidst a light, delicate ripeness of fruit and tannin."
Barrack,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.0,78.0,1,"Black licorice and compost add life and breadth to this roundly tannic, richly layered wine. Huckleberry and dark cherry give it a welcome fruitiness that's ripe and lush, as vanilla and cardamom complement the fruit."
Barrack,Merlot,93.0,46.0,2,"This blend of 70% Syrah, 25% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre is a beautiful shade of purple in the glass, and offers aromas of black plum and milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is silky, with zesty acidity that rises through blueberry and boysenberry flavors toward the caramel-layered finish."
Barrack,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,36.0,1,"This imposing and extremely ripe tasting wine has an inky dark color, aromas of ripe black cherries, flavors of cassis, espresso and bitter chocolate and a very firm, tannic texture to support all that opulence. Made from half Petite Sirah and half Syrah, it's a no-holds-barred feast of fruit and power."
Barrage Cellars,Cabernet Franc,90.0,35.0,1,"Lavishly, densely ripe and fruity, this big, juicy wine has everything in spades, from the nearly black color to the jammy, dessert-like aromas to the saturated blackberry and black fig flavors to a full, opulent body and richly tannic texture. It sure packs a lot of power into each sip."
Barrage Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,35.0,1,"Floral aromas of gardenia meet with crystalline peach notes and roasted macadamia nut pastry on the nose of this excellent bottling. The entry to the palate is soft, with rounded flavors of caramelized nectarine, vanilla and caramel, culiminating in a mouthwatering sea salt finish."
Barrage Cellars,Chardonnay,92.0,24.0,1,"This wine is textbook New World Viognier—bright, focused and balanced, with sassy fruit flavors of citrus and apricot. The aromatics conjure up subtle notes of citrus rind and jasmine flowers, and the overall length and concentration are as good as it gets."
Barrage Cellars,Malbec,86.0,40.0,1,"Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, the aromas start out quiet, with notes of cherry, wood spice and dark fruit. The flavors are reserved and polished, showing an exquisite sense of balance and a lingering finish."
Barrage Cellars,Merlot,87.0,28.0,2,"Big and tannic, but tempting and tasty at the same time, this wine tastes ripe, full bodied and fruity, wrapping a blanket of fine tannins around the richness to keep it from being too sweet or overripe. It's half Merlot and half Petite Sirah."
Barrage Cellars,Syrah,90.0,42.5,2,"This wine opens with aromas of vanilla and baking spices that are followed by broad, silky-feeling fruit and barrel flavors, finishing on a somewhat bitter note. The oak holds a prominent role but still plays its part well."
Barrel Road,Red Blend,88.0,17.0,1,"Tightly tannic, this 100% varietal wine comes from the producer's family estate. It's big in blackberry fruit and oak, the tannins generous on the palate. Ripe, plush plums figure into the finish, the wine bound to appeal to fans of Zinfandel for its robust nature."
Barrister,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.67,33.5,6,"Dark, brooding tones of oak, caramel and hazelnut form around medium acidity and a full-figured body of voluptuous texture in this Blanc de Blancs, a combination of 95% Chardonnay and 5% Pinot Grigio."
Barrister,Merlot,90.0,25.0,1,"A blend of Cabernet (70%) and Merlot, it offers aromas of dried herbs and rasinated dark fruit along with a kiss of vanilla. The fruit flavors are plump in feel with a sweet finish."
Barrister,Petit Verdot,88.0,39.0,1,"Salty, briny and tart, this was aged mostly in stainless steel, with 25% or so barrel-fermented. Ripe in melon and pear, the light-bodied quaff finishes crisp and clean. Hi Vista Vineyard belongs to the longtime owner of the Cliff House Restaurant in San Francisco and is farmed by Ned Hill."
Barrister,Red Blend,89.0,21.0,2,"The nose on this affordably priced wine from the historic winery is shy, though graphite and purple-fruit aromas slowly emerge. The palate shows lots of iron and condensed purple flower flavors."
Barrister,Sangiovese,90.0,29.0,1,"A bit light and tight on the nose, this shows condensed strawberries and dried beef aromas before diving into a palate of purple berries. It's an easy-drinking, well-made wine for everyday sipping, just not showing much extra pop."
Barrister,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,19.0,1,"Barrel aromas of vanilla, toast and woodspice are at the fore. The palate brings a full feel, with the wood taking over."
Barrister,Syrah,89.33,26.33,3,"This wine is lightly layered and linear, with stony green apple notes over a backdrop of toasted brioche."
Barrymore by Carmel Road,Pinot Noir,90.0,18.0,1,This behemoth of a wine grabs your attention with its deep color and late harvest aromas then coats the palate with superripe cherry and baking spice flavors. It comes across as Port-like despite its dryness and very firm tannins. Best after 2022.
Bartholomew Park,Zinfandel,90.0,45.0,1,Dried purple flower and candied Concord grape aromas lead the nose of this approachable bottling. The palate offers blackberry fruit and a touch of graphite-like minerality. It's pleasant but not overly complex.
Barton,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,62.0,1,"Aromas of exotic spice, game, cherry and medicine cabinet lead to plush fruit and savory flavors. The overt gaminess seems distracting, with the flavors tapering off toward the finish."
Barton,Chenin Blanc,88.0,22.0,1,"Well composed with a steely palate of green apple and lemon complemented by apple blossom aromas, this is a medium-bodied white that's easygoing and not overly complex."
Barton,Grenache,91.5,43.0,2,"This wine is full bodied and rich on the palate, with a woody reminder of oak. Spicy apple notes are lifted by spritzy acidity."
Barton,Grenache Blanc,88.0,24.0,1,"Bright acidity translates to the aromas in this bottling: laser-sharp lime zest, squeezed grapefruit, dewy grass and wet gravel. Those scents grow riper as the wine warms, while the palate seems sweeter—more lime candy than fresh lime. It finishes tart, with a wet metal freshness."
Barton,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,55.0,1,"Delicious and easy to drink, this is medium bodied and moderately fruity, with fresh spice and just-baked bread aromas. A perfect house wine to keep in stock."
Barton,Rhône-style White Blend,89.0,24.0,1,"This vineyard designate is 100% whole cluster fermented, an interesting study on the grape. Floral and earthy with lavender and black licorice aromas, it imparts substantial oak and tannin beneath its light rendering of black cherry fruit."
Barton,Rosé,88.0,26.0,1,"Bright aromas of peach, lime leaf, jasmine and flowers lead to off-dry mandarin orange and floral flavors. It provides a lot of appeal, though the concentration at times doesn't seem all there."
Barton,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,22.0,2,"This wine is two-thirds Sémillon and one-third Sauvignon Blanc. Aromas of toasted grapenuts, lemon and spice are followed by broad-feeling fruit flavors that show a lightly creamy feel."
Barton,Syrah,93.0,50.0,2,"This wine is nutty, with a pronounced aroma of stone fruit and preserved lemon. These characteristics follow through on the palate, buoyed by crisp acidity. The finish offers more voluptuous mouthfeel and weight."
Barton,Tempranillo,92.0,40.0,1,"A rich taste of caramel wraps around toasty charred oak in this young estate wine. Dense and chewy, it shows its youth and vintage signature, a sizable presence of tannin."
Barton,Zinfandel,92.0,40.0,1,"From a highly sought-after vineyard site, this wine is intense in tannin and weight, making the fruit work to express itself. Red berry and cherry are given additional richness by a taste of coconut macaroon, with a mellowed finish."
Basalt,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,22.0,2,"Hailing from Tudor Hills Vineyard, the aromas offer notes of padded butter, toast and spice. On the palate, the oak (70% new French) plays prominently, juxtaposed by full-bodied stone-fruit flavors that show some warmth."
Basalt,Cabernet Franc,87.0,32.0,1,This wine has mild flavors and a full mouthfeel. The aroma is light and vanilla-like while soft pear and nutmeg accents lay low on the palate.
Basalt,Sémillon,90.0,24.0,1,"One of the few red dessert wines with obvious new-oak flavors, this wine smells smoky and toasty. It tastes sweet and black peppery, and is very full bodied."
Basel Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.67,38.33,6,"The smoky, spicy aromas and richly oaked flavors of this medium-bodied wine are tempting and delicious. While the wine's personality comes mostly from new oak nuances, good fruit flavors lie underneath."
Basel Cellars,Cabernet Franc,87.5,36.0,2,"Hailing from the winery's estate vineyard, this wine offers aromas of baking spice, wood spice, milk chocolate and herb. The flavors are quite reserved in style, showing a sense of elegance, with barrel notes lingering on the finish."
Basel Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.67,34.67,6,"Toast, savory herb, vanilla and dark cherry aromas are followed by lush, full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. Vanilla and dill notes are speckled throughout and at times intrude."
Basel Cellars,Malbec,86.75,35.5,4,"Full bodied and stuffed with fresh fruit flavors, this dry wine made from grapes from three North Coast California counties smells and tastes like dark grape juice and ripe black cherries. The texture is lively but smooth, and the wine has a light tangy quality to balance its richness."
Basel Cellars,Merlot,87.5,30.0,4,"This dry, puckering wine driven by 76% Cabernet Sauvignon also contains 11% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 3% Cabernet Franc. The flavors tend toward the dried cherry, cranberry side of taste, with the oak dense and overpowering."
Basel Cellars,Red Blend,86.0,35.5,4,"Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Syrah all play a part in this wine. Pink-red in color and ripely sweet in stone fruit, it conveys intense, full-bodied layers of tannin and texture."
Basel Cellars,Syrah,92.0,28.0,1,"A blend of Sangiovese (53%), Cabernet Sauvignon (35%) and Merlot, this wine is aromatically locked up with notes of wet copper penny, cherry and herbs. The flavors are soft in feel with the oak seemingly dialed back. With time, the aromas and flavors may join together better."
Bateaux Cellars,Syrah,87.0,23.0,1,"With 20% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, this wine is muted yet robust, speaking with a loud voice of tannin and power. Simple and soft, it's ready to enjoy now."
Battle Creek,Pinot Noir,87.5,18.25,4,"A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in."
Baxter,Pinot Noir,91.0,48.0,1,"Disgorged in April 2014 four years after harvesting French Colombard from a single vineyard, this méthode champenoise wine is slightly odd in sour lemon and apple, unsure how far to take its acidity. It's a curiosity worth trying, but it won't be for everyone."
Beacon Hill,Pinot Noir,89.33,75.0,3,"This appealing, southern Rhône blend is a Châteauneuf-du-Pape style, with lush, forward red fruits and pleasing traces of the estate vineyard's characteristic dusty tannins."
Beast,Red Blend,89.67,24.67,3,"The Calico White is one of the state's most popular white blends, and is moving step by step toward an all-Rhône effort, now 44% Viognier 37% Roussanne, and just 19% Chardonnay. Winemaker Steffan Jorgensen deftly blends vineyards and AVAs to craft a refreshing, lightly-oaked wine with lime, lemon, pale peach and quinine."
Beast,Riesling,94.0,25.0,1,"This wine offers some meaty fruit flavors that gather round the midpalate and hold there; a big bundle of berries, cherries and plums, annotated with cinnamon and spice. There's even a hint of mint, and the slightest suggestion of fresh cilantro; the only off-note is a little gluey flavor in the finish."
Beaucanon,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,60.0,1,"INOX—from the French inoxidable—is Chehalem's stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay, what some might label “naked” or “unwooded.” It is widely available and very appealing, with a tart, stony texture and bright, acid-driven fruit. Green apple and citrus are front and center in this vintage, with a steely spine of natural acid and virtually no residual sugar."
Beaucanon,Cabernet Franc,86.0,30.0,1,"Soft, round and lengthy, there's a lot to admire and enjoy in this wine. Licorice, leather and undulating ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit combine on the palate. It's medium bodied, intense and complex, with dark chocolate accents on the finish."
Beaucanon,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,30.0,2,"Crisp and robust in pine-forest aromas, ripe cranberry and savory black tea, this coastal wine is feral yet velvety in texture. Concentrated and full bodied, it has underbelly that's undeniably mineral."
Beaucanon,Chardonnay,85.0,20.0,1,"This is the best of the 2015 vineyard designates from Soléna. It's a pretty wine with bright raspberry fruit. There's a gentle touch of stem, which helps to frame it, and a dark vein of espresso and cacao running through the tannins."
Beaucanon,Merlot,90.0,27.0,2,"From a tiny coastal vineyard, this wine appears light-bodied and delicate at first, building its power slowly in the glass. Sous bois, earthy spice and savory tea give it an edginess unfettered by fruit, while a healthy tannic structure keeps it grounded."
Beaucanon,Petit Verdot,88.0,35.0,1,"Deep color, bold fruit aromas and substantial, spicy flavors lend significant power and concentration to this full-bodied wine. It's nearly dry, well structured and balanced, with appealing blackberry, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors."
Beaulieu Vineyard,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,65.0,1,"Meaty and dense, this full-bodied red is expansive on the palate in well-defined layers of leather, blueberry and black pepper flavor."
Beaulieu Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.75,130.0,8,"This wine is restrained on the nose and initially on the palate, showing a touch of reduction and tightly-held flavor. As it opens, it unleashes juicy dark cherry, berry and huckleberry notes, its core dense with tannin and oak."
Beaulieu Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,88.0,55.0,1,"A block-designated, 100% whole cluster-fermented wine, this shows a slightly carbonic mouthfeel and vibrant acidity. The flavors lean toward wild strawberry, pomegranate and cranberry, with a depth of forest compost lurking underneath."
Beaulieu Vineyard,Merlot,88.0,19.0,1,"Ripe red raspberry fruit fills the nose; this seems more fruit forward than most other Klipsun designates. The tannins have been wrangled into submission, giving the wine good balance immediately, while preserving the acidity and tannic depth to age well. The blend is 57% Cabernet Sauvignon and 43% Merlot—a classic, un-fussy, straight-ahead Red Mountain style."
Beaulieu Vineyard,Pinot Noir,87.2,35.6,5,"Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive."
Beaulieu Vineyard,Red Blend,87.0,65.0,1,"Crafted by Mark McNeilly (Mark Ryan winery), this pure Syrah was cellared in about one third new oak. Tasted shortly after its release, it still showed a bit of a liquorous new oak scent, but without turning up the heat in the finish. The fruit is young and bright, a mix of raspberry, cassis and red licorice."
Beaulieu Vineyard,Zinfandel,85.0,34.0,1,"Upfront jalapeño, white pepper and freshly sliced bell pepper aromas lead the nose of this wine. It's soft in texture and an intriguing example of the variety."
Beauregard,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,65.0,1,"This Chardonnay's lees, custard, pear and spice aromas are somewhat inharmonious. It's elegant on the palate, however, showing graceful apple flavors."
Beauregard,Chardonnay,92.2,55.0,5,"This blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc, 15% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot boasts bright raspberry and cherry aromas, with green wood, baking spice and whiffs of game. The palate delivers concentrated fruit and medicinal flavors that carry through the finish."
Beauregard,Merlot,91.0,35.0,1,"Pure and fruity, this medium-bodied wine is supersmooth in texture, quietly flavorful and well balanced. The light acidity and mild tannins are well integrated and support delicious black-cherry and blueberry flavors perfectly."
Beauregard,Pinot Gris,89.5,30.0,2,"Char, firepit, barrel spice and herb aromas lead to elegantly styled cranberry flavors in this wine. The tannins lend a light structure."
Beauregard,Pinot Noir,93.0,51.67,3,"This wine's tightly wound woodspice, black cherry, cocoa, caramel and herb aromas are followed by tart, plentiful dark fruit flavors. It needs some time for its chewy, lightly dry tannins to settle, but plenty of good things are going on. Give it some time in the cellar or a long decant."
Beauregard,Sparkling Blend,91.0,80.0,1,"Dried herb, purple flower, vanilla, baking spice, black licorice and barrel spice aromas lead to ripe dark fruit flavors in this wine. Generous barrel accents run throughout while tannins bring a touch of dryness."
Beauregard,Syrah,92.5,35.0,2,"Made predominantly from Pinot Noir, this is an easygoing, approachable sparkling wine, offering dry creamy layers of green apple, pear and strawberry. It also has a rich inviting mousse embedded with vanilla and marzipan."
Beauregard,Zinfandel,90.0,35.0,1,"This wine shows cocoa, vanilla and barrel spice aromas on the nose. The medium-weight palate shows decent fruit tones however is overshadowed by heavy-handed oak."
Beaver Creek,Red Blend,89.0,39.0,1,"In this 100% varietal wine, tire rubber, spice box and flower aromas are followed by seamless dark fruit flavors backed by firm but well integrated tannins. It shows a pleasant balance that sustains through the finish."
Beckmen,Grenache,93.0,48.0,1,"Subtle pear, orange rind and peach aromas lead this Riesling, along with a floral top note. It drinks off dry, with stone fruit and ale flavors that need more time in bottle to settle. It comes up a bit short on the finish."
Beckmen,Red Blend,93.0,60.0,1,"Extremely light and delicate aromas of lemon, Gala apple and pear flesh show on the cleanly delivered nose of this bottling by Steve Dooley. There is also a lot of restraint on the palate, perhaps even a tad too much, with fluttering hints of chalk, sour limes and riper pear. The texture is compelling."
Beckmen,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,25.0,3,"This Cabernet Sauvignon's char, vanilla, caramel, toast, herb and dark fruit scents are followed by equal parts fruit and barrel flavors. It delivers enjoyment notwithstanding the heavy oak influence, which may yet integrate in the bottle."
Beckmen,Rosé,87.0,25.0,1,"This wine's aromas suggest woodspice, herb, parsley, cherry and smoke. Its cherry and coffee flavors are light in style and cut short on the finish."
Beckmen,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,18.0,1,"Light cherry, turned earth, rust and potpourri aromas show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling, which is exploring the lower end of the alcohol scale. The sip is very light and pleasant although a bit simple, with light cherry juice and tangy red plum most prominent."
Beckmen,Syrah,91.62,46.62,8,"This 100% varietal wine shows raspberry jam, fruit leather and plum aromas that are bright on the nose. The palate packs tart fruit flavors supported by plump, ripe tannins. It's not your typical Cabernet but still provides appeal, though the alcohol dominates at times."
Beckon,Pinot Noir,94.0,45.0,1,"Elderberry, white pepper, leather, asphalt and black olive show on the nose of this blend of all five Bordeaux varieties done in the region's savory style. The flavors are mellow overall, with wildfire smoke and a bit of herbaceousness decorating the elderberry and graphite core."
Bedell,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,65.0,1,"It's great to find both lots of fruit and good structure in a Zin, especially at such a reasonable price. Spicy aromas like vanilla and nutmeg precede vivid and ripe fruit flavors and more of those oaky spices on the palate where firm tannins and a bite of acidity give a mouthwatering balance."
Bedell,Merlot,87.0,48.0,1,"This blend of 60% Viognier and 40% Roussanne bursts with honeysuckle, jasmine, pear and ripe peach aromas. The flavors are broad and fleshy, with a slightly sharp finish that shows some warmth."
Bedell,Red Blend,86.0,35.0,1,"Oregon Chardonnay in the low 12% alcohol range is well out of the ordinary, but it reflects the vintage conditions in 2010. This is a wine for acid lovers, with very tart green-apple fruit and a bit of spice."
Bedell,Riesling,88.0,35.0,1,"Very dark in color, this jumps out at first because it's showy and high in alcohol, with seemingly sweet overtones that might appeal to lovers of brawny red wine.The oak, green pepper and olive undertones take over on the finish."
Bedell,White Blend,86.0,48.0,1,"The aromas are exuberant, with appealing notes of apricot, pineapple, honey, white flowers and citrus. The citrus and tropical-fruit flavors are rich yet elegant, topped by a lengthy finish."
Beekeeper Cellars,Zinfandel,89.5,61.25,4,"This well-made wine lies on the crisper, lighter-bodied style of the equation, softly textured and lengthy in that brightness of acidity. Anise, Good & Plenty and shocks of nutmeg provide intriguing notes of spiciness that complement the tartness of preserved lemon and green apple."
Bel Vino,Red Blend,88.67,45.33,3,"This wine is 64% Merlot and 36% Cabernet Franc. High-toned aromas of herb, cherry, cigar box, vanilla and baking spice are followed by coffee and cherry flavors that display a pleasing sense of balance, with espresso notes lingering on the finish."
Belden Barns,Chardonnay,89.33,36.0,3,"Part of a series that raises money for women working for justice in the world, this bottling that honors Dr. Victoria Kisyombe of Tanzania shows delicate lemon, lime zest, light marcona almond, popcorn and sandalwood nose on the complex nose. It is fresh and tightly wound on the palate, where citrus, chilled nectarine and a touch of salt cruise across strong acidity and a pithy texture."
Belden Barns,Grenache,91.0,44.0,2,"This is an aromatic wine, with vibrant yet still subtle notes of flowers, peach, citrus, lemon curd and wet stone. The fruit and savory flavors dance lightly on the palate, showing a lovely sense of finesse and grace. The balance is impeccable."
Belden Barns,Grüner Veltliner,89.5,27.0,2,"This wine was barrel fermented and aged in 100% new French oak. Aromas of sweet spices, toast and stone fruit are followed by a full-bodied palate. It shows a lovely sense of texture."
Belden Barns,Pinot Noir,88.0,43.0,4,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (80%), Malbec (12%) and Merlot. The aromas draw you into the glass, with notes of poblano, herb, spice, vanilla and cherry. The palate displays a mixture of fruit and barrel, with tightly wound tannins and bright acidity heightening the interest."
Belden Barns,Sauvignon Blanc,90.5,26.0,2,"The aromas bring notes of toast, spice and dark fruit. The flavors are pitch black, showing the warmth of the vintage and appellation along with their appeal."
Belden Barns,Sparkling Blend,90.0,38.0,2,"This is an exciting and promising blend for the winery and region. Cabernet Sauvignon and the Brunello clone of Sangiovese present aromas of pine wood, wet slate, mud, dark red cherries and tobacco smudge. Elderberry, juniper and cedar show on the woody palate that combines great acidity with firm structure."
Belden Barns,Syrah,91.25,42.0,4,"A touch of yogurt meets with flint, smoke, sandalwood, charred wood and grilled pineapple on the nose of this bottling. It is tightly wound and tense on the palate, where yellow-apple skins, grilled Asian pear and nectarine, sea salt, butter and smoke combine into tightly hewn sip."
Belharra,Syrah,90.17,30.0,6,"Bright orange blossoms, tangy lime, fresh rain, quince, green tea, jasmine and even a sesame element shine through on the nose of this bottling that carries a distinctively Asian character. Exotic citrus and brisk melon flavors show on the palate, which is lined with an ethereal undercurrent of bound up, bone-dry energy."
Bell,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,155.0,2,"This is a standout wine from the vintage, made from a selection of the Trione Cloverdale Ranch. Blended with smaller percentages of Merlot, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec, it sings in robust red and black cherry and currant, as well as more luxurious waves of chocolate and vanilla. There's a forwardness to the texture, making for a wine that's both big and happy."
Bell,Chardonnay,89.0,45.0,1,"A light, clear and bright wine from the heart of the appellation, this bottling exudes juicy layers of earthy cardamom spice and dark black cherry. It's well integrated and varietally consistent, offering jolts of minerality that buoy the texture."
Bell,Syrah,87.67,36.0,3,"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this wine brings aromas of iron and huckleberry pie. The blueberry and earth flavors are quite ripe, lingering on the finish."
Bella,Zinfandel,92.5,45.0,6,"Ripe, voluptuous blackberry and cherry overlie a dusty undercoat of tannin and minerality. These come across as rocky on the palate, complemented by moderate acidity and a rich texture. The fruit shows a maturity of both ripeness and attitude."
Bella Grace,Red Blend,88.0,25.0,1,"Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence."
Bella Grace,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,20.0,1,"This wine is insanely good, from a dry-farmed, yes, rocky outcropping of vines planted first in 1910, then again in 1934 and the 1970s, with Carignane and Petite Sirah in the mix. It's thick, rich and beautifully put-together, full bodied and entirely balanced, with markings of cherry cordial and white pepper that seduce gently."
Bella Grace,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,25.0,1,"Dark, brooding cinnamon and fleshy black plum provide an exciting, complex counterpoint to the rakish earthiness and exotic Asian spice going on in this full-bodied, explosively compelling wine, its minerality lingering. It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024."
Bella Grace,Zinfandel,87.5,25.0,2,"From a vineyard that Josh Jensen planted in 1975 comes this bottling that shows sultry black plum, minty herbs, tarragon, black slate, smashed mulberry and a touch of pork fat. A wondrous array of baked red and black fruit meet with clove, nutmeg, more tarragon and minty flavors on the palate too, producing delicious, dynamic flavor. It's like an expertly cooked stew of fruit, spice and herb."
Bella Luna,Barbera,87.0,40.0,1,"Youthfully flippant, this block of the Wayfarer Vineyard is sitting largely in sandstone, where the grapes pull remarkably revealing minerality from the soil. Racy and flinty, this medium-bodied, structured and flirty wine dances in a generosity of rich red fruit, raspberry mostly, seasoned in clove and cardamom that's fresh and incredibly seductive. Still, it'll age; drink now through 2024."
Bella Luna,Cabernet Sauvignon-Sangiovese,88.0,45.0,2,"With a majority of Pommard clone in this wine contributing to its undeniable breadth and depth, this rich, rewarding wine will benefit from further time in bottle. Sultry baking spice accents kirsch and strawberry, with understudies of tar, rose garden and tannin, all framed by moderate acidity. Cellar through 2023."
Bella Luna,Sangiovese,85.0,43.33,3,"Floral in aromas and yet darkly savory in cherry and clove, this full-bodied wine holds layered acidity and balanced oak at its core. It hails from one block of the vineyard and spent time in entirely new French oak. Baked raspberry tart finds a happy companion in the richness of maple and velvety tannin. Drink now through 2024."
Bella Luna,Sangiovese Cabernet,91.0,52.0,2,"The Heintz Vineyard is on the outskirts of the AVA, really pushing toward the coast, with the expected cool-climate characteristics of fresh acidity and complex, savory tones. This wine wows in every way, from its notes of exotic coconut meat and apple pie to its tang of Meyer lemon, all accented by bergamot and anise. The spice rides a wave of body and length toward the finish, alongside an unmistakable streak of minerality. Hold through 2024."
Bella Luna,White Blend,88.0,30.0,1,"Oh to have neighbors like these, bringing together several vineyard sites along this coveted stretch of the appellation. This bottling shows full-bodied richness and minerality dotted in a rose garden of pretty aromas and flavors. It's the silky-smooth texture that's most memorable, accented in earthy black tea and subtle oak tones."
Bella Luna,Zinfandel,90.0,40.0,2,"A stunning range of black sage, fresh bay leaf, hearty mulberry, exotic cinnamon, raw beef and baking spice converge for a rugged yet pretty nose on this bottling from a vineyard planted in 1975. Elderberry and elderflower show on the sip, as do beet juice, dried ginger, crushed rocks, potting soils and a concentrated potpourri of purple flowers."
Bella Piazza,Zinfandel,86.0,24.75,4,"The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture. Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?"
Bella Vigna,Zinfandel,82.0,16.0,1,"This voluptuously seductive wine is also elegantly balanced. Citrus, wet stone and sea salt lift the minerality to pronounced levels, accented by a crispness of lemon peel and papaya wrapped in blossoming jasmine. Many of the vines on the site date back nearly 40 years, a demonstration that in age there is beauty."
Bellacana,Chardonnay,86.0,19.0,2,"Bruised strawberries and ripe red plums are leveled by iron, ginger snaps, crushed slate and soy on the umami-laden nose of this bottling by Winemaker Jonathan Nagy. Intriguing river--stone minerality powers the palate, where black plums and olallieberries meet with black spice and lots of florality."
Bellangelo,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,82.0,13.0,1,"The appellation famous for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay packs a powerfully pretty punch when it comes to this variety, too, showing in this wine a soft, focused layering of Luxardo maraschino cherry and touch of cranberry. It then reveals an underlying richness that rewards the patient with a splash of white and black pepper, leaving an indelible stamp on the palate. Drink now through 2024."
Bellangelo,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,86.0,24.0,1,"Crafted from 12 different clones planted throughout the estate vineyard, farmed to perfection, this is a delicious and exuberant expression of blueberry crumble that's succulent and inviting in every way. Full bodied, it retains enough acidity to remain mouthwatering and yet complex, a subtlety of white pepper and cardamom biting at the its heels. Drink now through 2024."
Belle Ambiance,Red Blend,87.0,10.0,1,"This is a beautiful display of Durell's greatness, crafted from two blocks of the vineyard, one planted to Old Wente, the other in one of the site's most rocky and windy areas. Combined, it offers well-integrated notions of golden apple, pear and honey amidst a freshness of acidity and unobtrusive oak, just the slightest suggestion of nutmeg-dusted brioche on the finish."
Belle Vallée,Pinot Noir,85.0,41.0,2,"Gavin Chanin is expert at showing off individual vineyards, which is most evident in this bottling from a less iconic, larger site. Baked cherry, allspice, raw beef and light bay leaf show on the nose, while the palate carries ripe strawberry and a red-cherry core surrounded by zesty thyme, dill, mint and a touch of green olive. The light yet grippy texture is stunning."
Beltane Ranch,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,29.0,1,"Tasting quite sweet and soft, like a raspberry liqueur, this high-alcohol Zinfandel is wrapped in vanilla and cinnamon tones and would be difficult to pair with anything beyond barbecue."
Beltane Ranch,Zinfandel,92.0,44.0,2,"Earthy and very tight after aging 20 months in barrel and another two years in bottle prior to release, this wine's fruit is slipping away, leaving behind only a pruney sourness."
Ben Ish,Red Blend,86.0,20.0,1,"The nose on this bottling is classic for the grape: blackberry, dried lilacs, wet asphalt, beef char and black rocks. The palate is more muddled, with flavors of clay and freshly turned earth, without much spice or fruit to note."
Ben Ish,Zinfandel,86.0,20.0,1,"The wine was aged in 30% new American oak, and has modest cherry fruit with astringent tannins. There's an underlying earthy flavor, leading into a chalky finish."
Benaddiction,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,15.0,1,"This six-year-old wine is 40% Tempranillo, 40% Carmenère and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. The Carmenère dominates, pushing stiff, tannic, stemmy flavors into the core. It's not in danger of aging too quickly, but the tannins seem unlikely to soften."
Benessere,Aglianico,86.0,58.0,1,"Quite light in color, the aromas bring initially locked up but then broadly expansive notes of peat, green olive, white pepper, strawberry, Stargazer lilies, mineral and herb, showing a lot of complexity. The palate is textured, bringing a profound mixture of fruit and savory flavors that intertwine effortlessly on the long finish. It brings a sense of tension, texture and finesse that is completely captivating."
Benessere,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.33,71.67,3,"Hearty aromas of black cherry and mulberry meet with rustic iron, dark spice, crushed slate and dried sagebrush on the expertly woven nose of this bottling by a Southern California-based vintner. The palate balances bright acidity with upright tannins, allowing the dark-red fruit and mace spice flavors to shine."
Benessere,Moscato,89.0,25.0,4,"Juicy and stemmy, this is a big, bold wine, explosive in highlights of huckleberry, dark cherry and forest floor. With firm tannins for days, it offers enviable length and spice along a smooth grippy texture and forceful complexity."
Benessere,Red Blend,89.5,50.0,2,"And now for something completely different, this wine explodes in whole-cluster, carbonic freshness and surprise. It's a light cerebral take on the variety that delights at every turn. Stainless-steel fermented and aged, it's loaded in raspberry and cherry-jam flavors and dipped in black licorice. It's fresh, fruity and entirely memorable."
Benessere,Sagrantino,87.33,50.0,3,"Domaine Drouhin's reserve-level Chardonnay puts new oak flavors front and center but backs them up with ultraripe fruit. A lush mix of tangerine, melon and peach notes combine, expanding across the palate. It's drinking quite well already but should continue improve through 2024."
Benessere,Sangiovese,88.0,24.4,5,"Spicy, seductive and stemmy, this wine from the coveted vineyard site is a celebration of baked rhubarb and cranberry. Velvety on the palate and boldly ripe and rich, it offers highlights of spicy black tea and cardamom that complements and complicates the fruit."
Benessere,Zinfandel,88.0,35.0,5,"This is from a tremendous vineyard site near the top of the appellation, situated from 1,250 to 1,800 feet. It incorporates small additions of Zinfandel and Carignane into the whole, a picture of soft beguiling violet aromas that are followed by a velvety texture and underlying grip of tannin. Rich red fruit and a taste of licorice linger on the intense finish."
Bennett Lane,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,105.0,2,"This succulent wine is saturated with rich citrus flavors. Grapefruit, lemon, lime and pineapple notes combine while its 18 months in barrel contributes a layer of buttery toast."
Bennett Lane,Chardonnay,90.0,52.0,1,"The debut vintage for this cuvée, this is made from 100% Wente clone vines planted in 1977. It's richly concented on the palate, layered with dried apricot, grapefruit and pineapple flavors. A lush, buttery note enwraps its long, satisfying, full-bodied finish."
Bennett Lane,Red Blend,90.0,42.0,1,"Floral and surprisingly bright, this wine is driven by sharply etched acidity and citrus—its flavors balanced and complementary. Red cherry and raspberry find companionship in seasonings of cinnamon and clove, the texture slightly leathery and bold."
Bennett Lane,White Blend,90.0,35.33,3,"Meaty in wild berry and leather, this is a high-toned wine with a gritty texture that evolves to become velvety in the glass. Generously ripe and rich in body, it's intense and fresh in equal measure, showing a complement of balanced brawn and beauty."
Benovia,Chardonnay,94.0,48.67,3,"Quite light in aroma at first, this is a delicate, lithe and lovely bottling, showing lemon and yellow pear tones on the nose. That sensibility carries to the palate, where touches of yellow apple, sea salt, faint banana and a shred of bubblegum converge for a complete yet restrained white wine experience."
Benovia,Pinot Noir,93.75,68.75,4,"The producer's flagship wine, this vintage blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Dry tannins provide a leathery texture atop piquant sensibilities of cedar, pencil and chocolate-specked blackberry jam. Structured and full bodied, it'll benefit from further cellaring. Drink now through 2022."
Benton-Lane,Pinot Noir,87.0,41.33,9,"Single block wines, such as this one, often show a tight focus rather than a broad palate. Here it works well, wrapping savory notes around red currant fruit. There's a lightly metallic ring to the flavors, running straight through the finish. Give this a few hours of decanting, or tuck it away for drinking after 2020."
Benziger,Pinot Noir,86.0,29.0,1,"Farmed by the vineyard manager who owns Small Vines, another small Pinot Noir producer, this is a complex, well-crafted wine, high in acidity and high-toned red fruit, like cranberry, pomegranate and cherry, with a wisp of orange peel on their heels. Light-bodied, it finishes with black tea and mushrooms fighting for attention."
Benziger,Rosé,90.0,15.0,1,"Refined and complex, this limited-production, vineyard-designate wine starts with lemony acidity, but there's much more to discover as it bores down through the palate. Meyer lemons, grapefruit and nectarines are in the mix, with refreshing minerality."
Beresan,Red Blend,89.4,21.0,5,"Pretty in jasmine, lemon and orange, this is a crisp, dry and lovely wine, integrated with just enough heft on the body and a surprisingly deft length on the finish. Stock up for gatherings."
Beresan,Rhône-style White Blend,90.0,16.0,1,"Named for a Loire Valley clone, this New World wine aspires to an Old World sensibility and achieves it in its floral invitation and bright, peppery overtones. Coiled within its thickness of tannin and dense cherry are ethereal, earthy whispers of intrigue and acidity. This is a lively, lovely wine."
Beresini Vineyards,Pinot Noir,87.0,45.0,1,"Clean aromas of honeysuckle converge with richer, rounded components of Asian pear, coconut and pineapple on the nose of this single vineyard expression. There's a caramel touch at the tip of the rich sip, with layers of brown spice, yellow fruit and rocky earth."
Bergevin Lane,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,58.0,1,"Let this burly, big-boned beauty open to fully enjoy its robust oak and fistfuls of black cherry, the oak showing in terms of toasty, slightly reductive aromas. A smooth texture keeps the wine flowing along a concentrated highway of power and ripeness."
Bergevin Lane,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,28.0,1,"This wine is a bold but well-mannered blockbuster that serves generous helpings of dark color, spicy aromas, concentrated flavors and a luxurious dry texture. It needs full-flavored, rich food to accompany it, and will deliver a lot of pleasure under those circumstances. Best to drink now through 2020."
Bergevin Lane,Chardonnay,86.0,15.0,2,"Another stunning deal on this annual bottling, this wine is jammy and fruity on the nose with buttered cherries and berry jam, yet layered with baking spice and wet clay minerality. Dried strawberries, black cherries and plums show on the palate, enhanced by a toasted clove, graphite, juniper and forest floor mintiness."
Bergevin Lane,Malbec,88.0,28.0,1,"The signature bottling from this winery, this very dark blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Petit Verdot, 13% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc offers deep black plum and black currant as well as cigar box, smoked beef and caramel on the nose. A blackberry-purée flavor leads the very fruit-driven palate, which is bolstered by black pepper, violet, shaved dark chocolate and espresso bean."
Bergevin Lane,Merlot,88.5,21.0,2,"This wine has jazzy, jammy aromas and ripe blackberry and strawberry flavors, wrapping them in a warm layer of fine-grained tannins and a nice dash of sweet baking spices from aging in oak."
Bergevin Lane,Red Blend,89.2,31.6,5,"Rounded strawberry, orange peel, tart black raspberry and a touch of juniper pop on the nose of this appellation blend by members of the pioneering Bargetto family. Black plum skins, crushed slate, raspberry juice and fresh-picked thyme show on the palate."
Bergevin Lane,Roussanne,87.0,24.0,1,"Floral, pretty and light, this wine was made for porch sitting and all-around relaxing. It never gives up on fruit and complexity, offering a medium body and vibrant acidity around the rose-petaled texture. This is a lovely sipper."
Bergevin Lane,Sauvignon Blanc,88.5,11.0,2,"The slightest shade of yellowish pink, this wine is a great study of fresh acidity and compelling texture in a rosé. Very slight and soft strawberry and squeezed lemon aromas kick off the experience, followed by light red fruit sliced by tangy kumquat on the palate. The flavors are not particularly complex or unique, but the sip is fascinating."
Bergevin Lane,Syrah,88.14,39.71,7,"Though pale in hue, this is big in flavor. It's a textbook Pinot Noir rosé, sharp, tight and showing deep flavors of rhubarb, rosewater and strawberry fruit. There's exceptional length along with the lovely, fresh fruit flavors."
Bergevin Lane,Viognier,90.0,20.0,1,"This is a lovely, full-bodied expression of apple blossom aromas, just-ripe pear and orange Creamsicle, a balanced mix of rich and sublime that remains smooth and silky on the palate with a lingering finish."
Bergevin Lane,White Blend,89.0,16.0,2,"Scents softly suggest rose petals and milk chocolate, leading into a wine that seems to hit a hard stop midpalate. A clear flavor of cold steel resonates against a counterpoint of tart berry fruit."
Bergström,Chardonnay,94.12,71.88,8,"This wine is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A minty, menthol streak is strong on the nose, veering into almost eucalyptus, while dried herb and a shot of gunpowder provide additional savory aromas and flavors. Big tannins need time in the glass to mellow."
Bergström,Pinot Noir,92.24,66.41,29,"This wine comes from Alexander Valley-grown Malbec, a variety the producer has been planting in earnest over the last few years. Dark pink-red, it is medium bodied and refreshing, with notes of cherry, blueberry and vanilla."
Beringer,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.75,71.5,4,"An earthy, leathery, spicy nose dominates this 100% Cabernet from 17-year-old vines. This is an elegant, complex, earthy wine, beautifully balanced with classic cassis laced with leather, barnyard, coffee, smoke and spice. 180 cases made."
Beringer,Chardonnay,89.5,34.0,4,"A much more concentrated version of the regular bottling. The fruit is still raspberries and cherries, but there is more focus and power, and it’s wrapped in smooth milk chocolate. A flat-out delicious bottle of Merlot."
Beringer,Pinot Grigio,86.0,10.0,1,"Harvested at a lip-smacking 42.5° brix, this seductive wine explodes on the palate with bright grapefruit and citrus flavors, highlighted with sharp acids and finishing with lingering notes of caramel and butter. Long and delicious."
Beringer,Red Blend,91.0,65.0,1,"The effusive, floral, fragrant nose opens into phenomenal tangerine and satsuma orange flavors, enlivened with spice and a wonderful, refreshing mouthfeel (from barrel fermentation). Best Buy."
Beringer,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,10.0,1,"This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine."
Bernard Machado,Pinot Noir,86.0,40.0,1,"This clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors. Shows some interesting herbal nuances of thyme and oregano. Good focus in a fruit-forward style; tight and delicious with a pretty finish."
Bernardus,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,75.0,1,"The big, powerful nose showcases blackberry, plum and brambly components. This tight, tannic, nicely constructed, ageworthy Cabernet features dark licorice streaks running through the long finish."
Bernardus,Chardonnay,90.43,40.0,7,"Spice and melons illuminate the nose; the wine displays amazing concentration, with deep, syrupy peach and apricot fruit, and a bit of sugar and toasted coconut in the finish. Good acid balance. It's still very young, but immediately delicious."
Bernardus,Pinot Noir,91.5,60.0,14,"The lovely, lushly fruity nose features plenty of buttery, roasted walnut scents from new oak fermentation. Despite the oak, it retains its freshness and acid balance, keeping it lively through a long, toasty finish."
Bernardus,Red Blend,90.0,65.0,1,"Blended with a small amount of Merlot (10%), this wine sends up a classic bouquet of cassis and berry, with a nice hint of mint. It’s well crafted, but tight and a little hard yet, especially in the finish. Built for aging."
Bernardus,Sauvignon Blanc,87.33,22.67,3,"Blueberries, plums, and especially cherries, with a lovely, soft, beguiling bouquet of rose blossoms and chocolate. Crisply structured, with tight fruit, soft tannins, and a medium-weight, extended finish."
Bernat,Syrah,90.75,31.25,4,"A value-driven Cabernet to be sure and one, under the Conservancy mantra, that serves to raise funds to protect vineyard land from urban development. This vintage is full, with baked plum and earthy flavors, even-handed overall, with a hint of green bean on the finish."
Berryessa Gap,Red Blend,87.0,32.0,1,"Just a splash of Chenin Blanc has been added to the blend, adding some lift to the aromas and suggestions of citrus blossom. The natural herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc has been kept in check, but the wine is clean and varietal. The flavors seem just a bit muted, almost thin, but it's a perfectly refreshing, if simple effort."
Berryessa Gap,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,18.0,1,"Orange, nectarine, canned pear and honeysuckle show on the nose of this quaffable bottling. The palate is nicely creamy but not overly thick, with banana cream and pear-mousse flavors that grow increasingly tropical as the sip lingers."
Berryessa Gap,Verdelho,87.0,18.0,1,"Made in a thick, oaky style, this shows burned caramel, fudge and hints of dried mint and oregano on the nose. The palate is rich with blueberry and dark chocolate, wrapped in a veil of oak smoke, with chunky, chewy tannins and a purple-flower nuance."
Berryessa Gap,Zinfandel,90.0,20.0,1,"Made from vines well over 100 years old on the Kunde Estate, this wine is tight and youthful in dry, dusty and grippy tannin, with thick, extracted flavors of red berry and cherry. A streak of pencil lead and fig provides further intrigue and complexity around a full-bodied elegance."
Bethany Vineyard,Barbera,86.0,28.0,1,"Very deep black plum, smashed red berries, concentrated cola and coffee liqueur aromas entice the nose on this blend of 40% Cabernet Franc, 40% Zinfandel and 20% Grenache. It's very spicy and lively on the palate with an almost biting, explosive acidity. Flavors of espresso and deep red fruits are noticeable."
Bethany Vineyard,Pinot Noir,85.0,26.5,2,"Veteran producer Oak Knoll remains one of Oregon's most underrated value wineries. This full-bodied, super-fruity Riesling offers bright, off-dry, well-balanced flavors of citrus, honey and tea."
Bethel Heights,Chardonnay,92.57,59.57,7,"Firm, well-modulated and medium-bodied, this estate-grown wine brings a mix of apple flesh and skin, along with a strong scent of biscuit. and hint of vanilla. Overall it's staunchly varietal, though not especially complex."
Bethel Heights,Pinot Noir,91.24,47.41,17,"Fresh red cherries, strawberries and cranberry greet the nose on this widely available wine that also shows mocha and charred chaparral. The palate is lively and also boasts some decent tannins, offering flavors of plum and pomegranate juice, crushed marjoram and licorice."
Betz Family,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.71,54.86,7,"Milk chocolate and dark plum combine to nice effect in this majority-Merlot, blended with almost 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dry, savory and spicy in cinnamon and clove, the wine is substantially dense and thick on the palate."
Betz Family,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.25,82.75,12,"This has a dark red-black color, with densely packed aromas that seem so tight they are not giving up much. Flavors of concentrated dark plum and white pepper are interlaced with very firm tannins. It's full bodied, young and wound up tight. Drink it now for the wow factor, or be adventurous and save it until 2020 to see how much more flavor complexity develops."
Betz Family,Grenache,93.0,45.0,1,"Smoky red and black berry wrap themselves around a full-bodied expression of fruit and introverted oak, managing to provide texture and body through a foundation of well-managed acidity. With a grippiness on the finish, the wine offers velvety power and finesse."
Betz Family,Red Blend,92.0,46.6,5,"Sweet oak perfume comes from 25% new French barrels. The oak influence is well integrated with ripe fruit, firm tannins, good concentration and medium-full body. They add up to an enticing, complex and delicious wine that is very lively, a bit lean, and will age through at least 2019."
Betz Family,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,51.43,7,"The winery's coolest, lightest Syrah, this is an elegant, ethereal wine, sanguine and gamy with an abundance of white pepper and blueberry. Complex, it takes on a thick middle before finishing lean and soft."
Betz Family,Syrah,92.76,55.76,21,"A deep, dark color, ripe blackberry aromas and berry and spice flavors add up to a full-bodied, impressive wine from one of the oldest wineries in the Sierra Foothills. Smoky, oaky accents help shape the opulent fruit flavors, and enough firm tannins and lively acidity provide good balance."
Bevela,Syrah,91.0,35.0,1,"This is a reserve-level blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, given extra bottle-age prior to release. If you favor more than a hint of stem and herb in your Bordeaux-style blends, you'll find this quite interesting. Complex layers of iron, smoke, coffee grounds and cassis are in play, with a slight bitterness to the tannins. Pair it up with lamb chops right off the grill."
Bevela,Teroldego,91.0,40.0,1,"This winery's Walla Walla Valley debut displays aromas of ash, green olive, grilled asparagus, dried flowers, smoked meat and blue fruit. The smoke and savory flavors are soft and reserved in style, showing a pleasing persistence on the finish."
Bianchi,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.5,20.0,2,"The dark garnet color seems right for a wine that smells like black cherries and black-skinned plums, and tastes deep and rich. Both the flavors and the texture seem shaped by subtly spicy oak. Fine-grained tannins add a velvety touch and the finish lingers."
Bianchi,G-S-M,89.0,22.0,1,"The grape's fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry are nicely focused and rounded, but the vanilla and tobacco components, perhaps from aggressive oak treatment, bring in a bit of bitterness to the tannins. It's a fight to the finish—fruit or tannin—and too soon to pick a winner."
Bianchi,Merlot,87.0,22.0,2,"A fine, soft-tannined Cab made from Lodi Rules grapes missing some body in the midpalate, but otherwise fair for the $12 price."
Bianchi,Pinot Grigio,84.0,15.0,1,"This late-harvest Viognier looks like a still wine as it comes out of the bottle, exploding with honey and wildflowers on the nose. Its fruitiness is restrained somewhat and would stand out paired with a crème brûlée—though on its own, the alcohol is overpowering."
Bianchi,Red Blend,91.0,26.0,1,"Name checking an old stretch of Lodi highway, this Cab has more red cherry fruit than black as well as a noticeable trace of cedar, lacking in structure and acidity perhaps but decent enough—and very fairly priced—to pop open with a midweek steak. The grapes used are Lodi Rules certified green sustainable."
Bianchi,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,16.0,1,"This unusual dry Gewürztraminer puts the flavor focus squarely on grapefruit and pineapple, with a bone-dry acid underpinning. It has moderate concentration and length, with alcohol rated at just 12.5%."
Bianchi,Syrah,91.5,22.0,2,"Co-fermented with Viognier from the same vineyard, this is a lovely counterpoint to the big, bruising Barrister Bacchus Vineyard Syrah. Violets and chocolate dominate, with wild herb and cured meat flavors through the midpalate. Tannins are chewy and textured, with some stem and bark flavors."
Bianchi,Zinfandel,87.0,19.0,1,"Chatter Creek's value-priced Bordeaux blend is often his most appealing red wine upon release. This is scented with hard cherry candy, and the flavors follow right on course. It needs some breathing time to open out, and as it does, the finish lingers with pleasing streaks of coffee and toast."
Bieler Family,Pinot Grigio,87.0,13.0,1,"This is co-fermented Old Stones Vineyard and Cailloux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (60%) and Syrah (40%), showing the funk of the terroir and less of the varietal character of the fruit. It's flavorful and textural, with earth, anise and smoke notes, plus a mineral-driven wet-stone base and exceptional length."
Big Basin,Chardonnay,92.5,46.0,2,"Truly stunning, the Lewis Estate Riesling from Dunham explodes with fragrant fruits—citrus, melon and tropical. A symphony of subtle accents, such as powdered sugar, candied citrus peel and breakfast tea, this gorgeous bottle belongs with the short list of the very best of Washington's many Rieslings."
Big Basin,G-S-M,93.0,47.75,4,"This is made from fruit sourced from the oldest block of Syrah in Washington, which was planted in 1986. The nose expresses complex varietal character, with a mix of blue and purple berry, a dusting of earth and accents of cinnamon and incense. Subtle and expressive, this is the best vintage to date for the Patriarche."
Big Basin,Grenache,92.5,49.5,2,"This will be the last Ovide from En Cerise grapes. It's an explosion of cherry and milk chocolate flavors, remaining firm with expressive highlights of olive, earth and herb. It is two-thirds Cabernet and one-third Syrah, a perfect melding of the two grapes. Arguably, one gets better aromatics than Charles Smith, and the wine flavors deliver on their initial promise."
Big Basin,Grenache-Syrah,92.0,55.0,1,"Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this has a nice peppery lift. The fruit flavors seem less forward, with the herbal components much more front and center. It's made from a clone specific to the Cougar Hill Vineyard, showing cool climate flavors with subtle grace. Given a full 24 hours of breathing time, it opens further into a dazzling, rich mix of cherry and cassis that's soaked in an herbal broth."
Big Basin,Pinot Noir,92.5,48.75,16,"This is pure Cabernet—tight, tannic and terroir-driven. It has a dense mix of fruit, rock, earth and herb flavors that are nicely integrated, with a full palate and fine complexity and density. A little more barrel toast would put the icing on the cake."
Big Basin,Red Blend,93.0,36.0,1,"From the acclaimed Champoux vineyard, this puts the purple fruit in a wrap of pretty baking spices. Barrel aging adds cocoa and coffee, while the acidity is sufficient to keep the wine from feeling too tannic. Another couple of years of bottle age—or brisk decanting—should put it at its peak."
Big Basin,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.5,36.0,2,"Distinctive and generous, this white Rhône-style wine is made from Sierra Foothills grapes by a seasoned Napa winemaker. It tastes like vanilla, hazelnuts and pears, has a creamy texture, feels layered with fruit and spice notes, and has good acidity balanced by richness of flavor."
Big Basin,Roussanne,92.0,48.0,2,"A classic Napa Valley Chardonnay, this is smooth, rich, balanced and well composed. Flowery aromas of honeysuckle open the way for lemon curd and ripe apple to compete with a depth of crème brûlée character that provides plenty of complexity, with additional accents of honey and spice."
Big Basin,Syrah,92.29,53.0,7,"Attractively priced, this Cab—with 5% Petit Verdot—offers meaty bacon and smoky oak character around sizable tannins, black currant, black licorice and a finishing dust of mocha."
Big Basin,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,53.5,2,"Winemaker Anna Monticelli spent a harvest at Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux and worked under Philippe Melka at Seavey and Bryant Family. She leaves her own mark on this structured, silky, robust and rich Cabernet, bright in red cranberry and clove. Firehouse Vineyard is on the winery estate and given to floral and herbal notes, both of which suggest themselves slowly here."
Big Smooth,Zinfandel,89.0,18.0,1,"Warmed croissant yeastiness matches up with sea salt and lemon butter on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering Santa Barbara Winery. The salinity carries on the palate, with apple pie and butterscotch presenting a nicely oaked but not overdone palate."
Big Table Farm,Chardonnay,94.0,85.0,1,"Fruity frills of strawberry surround a core of black New Mexican chiles, with cinnamon and clove emerging the longer one sniffs. There's nice tension between the fruit flavors and the nearly bell pepper greenness. Throw a chill on it and serve with barbecued pork."
Big Table Farm,Edelzwicker,90.0,28.0,1,"This is a delicious Chardonay. It dances in pear, peach and lemon notes. Balanced and addictive, it's easy to love and not overly complicated at all. Encased in just enough oak to provide texture and weight, this is a great wine for parties or casual dinners, pairable with just about anything."
Big Table Farm,Pinot Gris,90.0,32.0,2,"Slightly funky scents of asphalt and sweaty socks come along with graphite, pressed blackberry and New Mexico chile. The palate is led by tobacco-laced zing, opening with boysenberry flavors, and finishing with decent acidity and mouth-coating tannins."
Big Table Farm,Pinot Noir,90.33,48.0,6,"Made from a mix of vineyards across the Napa Valley, this pays tribute to the early days of grape growing in the region and is a wine equally worthy of recognition. Exhibiting dark cherry stone and wild strawberry aromas, the palate is complex, tannic and round, a subtle suggestion of smoke on the finish balanced by bright acidity."
Big Table Farm,Rosé,90.0,32.0,1,"This is a lightly aromatic wine, with notes of lees, apple, mineral and spice. It's medium bodied, with a thick, textured feel showing good weight and intensity to the fruit flavors alongside well-balanced acidity. A uniquely styled wine without an easy comparison in the region."
Big Table Farm,White Blend,88.0,28.0,1,"Coming in at 12.8% alcohol—nearly unheard of for a Washington red, particularly in a warm vintage—it brings appealing notes of dark plum accented by black pepper and dried herbs. It's silky soft in feel with a dazzling sense of texture and purity with little apparent oak influence."
Biltmore Estate,Sparkling Blend,88.33,25.0,3,"There's been no price increase for this outstanding value, but the quality keeps going up and up. It's packed with juicy red berry and cassis fruit—supple, tangy, deep and lingering. The finish carries a suggestion of chalk, more in the sense of minerality than any artificial dryness."
Bink,Merlot,88.0,28.0,1,"Sanguine and brawny, it's concentrated in dark plum and blueberry fruit, with an earthy element teasing around the edges. The finish is marked by power and grip."
Bink,Rosé,89.0,18.0,1,"Almost like a salad in your glass, this fresh-tasting, dry white wine smells like sugar snap peas and just-picked greens. It tastes snappy and crisp with parsley and thyme flavors, and has a refreshing texture."
Bink,Sauvignon Blanc,89.5,22.0,2,"Bold and fruity, this saignée-style rosé is 75% Syrah and 25% Pinot Noir. Tart, tangy, primary fruit flavors of watermelon, strawberry and cranberry fill the mouth, turning just a little bit sour in the finish."
Bink,Syrah,89.0,32.0,1,"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through."
Birichino,Chenin Blanc,90.0,20.0,1,"An aromatically appealing wine with notes of cinnamon, chocolate and cherry. Unfortunately, it's quite tart with grainy, somewhat bitter tannins."
Birichino,Grenache,87.0,21.0,1,"This is the inaugural vintage for this producer, a husband-and-wife team in partnership with winemaker Maayan Koschitzky, who also works with Philippe Melka. The vineyard-designate is lush and powerful, a full-bodied, tannic representative of an amazing growing year. Mint, black olive, blackberry and cigar highlight the sensual texture, enriched in dark chocolate."
Bishop's Peak,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,28.0,1,"Candied cranberry and grape meet with light nutmeg, gingersnap cookies and wet slate on the rich, interesting nose of this wine by Lompoc-based Brian Loring. The palate is power-packed and spicy, with boysenberry, sandalwood, cedar, incense, star anise and black-tea touches."
Björnson,Chardonnay,89.0,35.0,1,"Rhubarb, ripe cherry and wet slate show on this wine, one of the many higher-end, single-vineyard expressions that winemaker Paul Clifton makes for the Hahn family. Hearty beet juice and lots of star anise show on the sip that is redolent with dark, wild berries."
Björnson,Pinot Noir,88.0,35.0,2,"Baked black cherry, rare roast beef and light sage aromas show on the dynamic, earthy nose of this bottling by Winemaker Paul Clifton. Garrigue is prominent on the tip of the sip, with strong but not overripe black cherry and plum flavors. These lead into forest floor, juniper, pine needle and mulling spice on the finish."
Black Box,Red Blend,84.0,25.0,1,"Concentrated, well structured and not too full bodied, this is an almost architectural wine in how it fills out the palate and clings to the taste buds. It has an appetizing texture due to fine-grained tannins, a sense of ripeness without overripeness, plus deep and layered fruit, coffee and black-pepper nuances."
Black Cordon,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,175.0,1,"From a block planted in 1910 consisting of hearty portions of mixed blacks, this wine is abundantly floral in rose petals, with a plummy core dusted in smoky oak. The tannin structure is sizable, while the wine is full of leather, cigar box and black pepper accents that weave within the ripe fruit."
Black Cordon,Chardonnay,92.5,57.5,2,"An oxidative style of Chardonnay seems to match the old-vine character in this bottling that is a nutty yellow in color and shows crushed hazelnuts, dried lemon, sourdough and croissant on the nose. Lemon rinds, tangerine and walnut flavors appear on the sip, which is rich and nutty but not unctuous."
Black Coyote,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,106.0,2,"This sultry, big-boned wine offers deft aspects of black pepper and dried herb atop a softly layered touch of brown sugar. Richness is there, as is a voluptuous flirtatiousness, yet it remains dry and dusty on the palate and classically varietal."
Black Kite,Chardonnay,91.8,46.8,5,"A blend of Syrah (68%), Grenache (29%) and Viognier, this wine brings pungent, directly appealing aromas of smoked meat, blue fruit, black olive, orange peel and high-toned flowers. The blue and black-fruit and smoked-meat flavors are silky and well constructed with a finish that lingers."
Black Kite,Pinot Noir,92.17,56.67,6,"A savory rather than fruity blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this bottling offers black pepper, anise and light violet alongside boysenberry and elderberry fruit on the nose. The palate tightens up into underripe cherry, thyme, marjoram and bay leaf, with very dry elderberry fruit tones."
Black Ridge,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.25,49.0,4,"Handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, a lovely, medium-bodied beauty that finds balance in its measured use of oak. Vanilla, plum and bold jolts of pepper and cinnamon combine well on the lengthy palate."
Black Ridge,Chardonnay,89.0,45.0,3,"Light strawberry and black cherry fruit is the story here, backed with decent acidity. Tannins are dark and well-structured, so the wine keeps its balance. Though it does not have the weight or depth of Washington Syrahs, or the sweet berry flavors of California, it is soundly made, drinking well, fruit forward, and a good choice for warm weather sipping."
Black Ridge,Pinot Noir,91.2,50.4,5,"Anywhere but in Oregon, this could be labeled Pinot Noir, which makes up 80% of the blend; the rest is Zinfandel. It's a combination that makes sense in the Columbia Gorge. The Pinot is more earthy and tannic than in the Willamette Valley, and the Zin lighter than you find in California. The result is a wine tasting of wild cherries, tart, spicy and quite quaffable."
Black Ridge,Viognier,90.0,32.0,1,"Still young, hard and sharp-edged, the wine reveals dark flavors of charred toast and espresso, set around a core of tight cranberry and raspberry fruit. It's built to age, and has some pleasing mocha and spice notes rounding out the finish."
Black Saint Peter,Zinfandel,88.5,16.5,2,"From a vineyard holding in the midst of prime Pinot Noir country, Maffei intrigues in ripe, hearty plum, black cherry and kir aromas and flavors. The tannins are soft and nicely managed, accented by notes of nutmeg and black pepper."
Black Stallion,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.33,102.56,9,"The producer continues to impress with this estate Russian River white, an impressive ambassador for the region in its exuberant layers of apricot, honey and vanilla. The substantial texture and concentration stand out and add complexity. A lift of lemon meringue and spice complete the finish."
Black Stallion,Chardonnay,90.0,35.0,3,"Silky carpets of cherry grenadine invite one into this vineyard-designate, framed by seductive streaks of herbes de Provence and earthy black tea. Juicy and generous on the palate, the wine is also complex and restrained, its finish wrapped in toasty, subtle oak."
Black Stallion,Merlot,91.0,40.0,2,"Still young and sappy, the tart raspberry and cherry fruit carries tangy highlights of citrus rind and wet stone. Clean and fresh, it's a perfectly balanced wine from a difficult vintage, and has the structure to age through 2021–2023."
Black Stallion,Pinot Grigio,88.0,26.0,1,"Bergfeld is named for the winery's historic owner and the land he originally planted around the winery in 1873. Given to old-world airs, the wine is chalky in black fruit, tobacco and mocha, as well as soft, substantial tannins. Generous in juiciness and structure, it has an herbal quality on the finish."
Black Stallion,Red Blend,94.0,150.0,1,"From a highly sought-after source of Cabernet, this is classically oaky and dusty, a sophisticated take on the grape, dense and soft in waves of black cherry. With medium weight that picks up steam on the milk-chocolate finish, it's an impressive sipper or worthy companion to steak and potatoes."
Black Stallion,Rosé,87.0,26.0,1,"Sourced from a so-called “mystery clone” that may have originally arrived in Charles Coury's suitcase back in 1964, this unique old-vine bottling offers exceptional details of dusty cocoa, baking spices, cola, minerals and iron filings. The brambly berry fruits are not at all overwhelmed, just balanced out with the structure for aging. Drink now through 2025."
Black Stallion,Sauvignon Blanc,88.5,26.0,2,"Just one barrel was made of this reserve. At first the new oak shines through, then as it opens out the wood becomes less noticeable and a complex array of spice, stem and iron filings comes into play. The fruit is light and textural, showing hints of sassafras and even a whiff of petrol."
Black Stallion,Syrah,90.5,40.0,2,"Flinty and austere, this is an elegant white wine crafted from 100% Musque clone, dancing in pear and grapefruit. The layered texture impressively stands out, riding the wave between creamy and lemony crisp with precision, opening the door for the wine to finish refreshingly."
Black Stallion,Viognier,90.0,35.0,1,"This Dundee Hills vineyard really shines in 2012, with multi-layered flavors of sweet, spicy, slightly candied fruits. Kirsch, orange peel, smoke and sandalwood play against each other, with a citrus kick to the underlying acidity. Bright and focused through a long finish, this is one to tuck away for a few years. Drink 2017–2025."
Black Stallion,Zinfandel,90.8,46.0,5,"This sophisticated effort maxxes out the potent cherry fruit with plenty of barrel toast. Much like the winery's reserve, the cherries are matched to roasted walnut flavors, with a hint of chipotle."
Black's Station,Chardonnay,88.0,12.0,1,"Sweet and extra ripe, this pushes the peach and apricot fruit to a rich and focused center, and keeps the impact of new French oak at just 20%. Which is plenty, adding just enough sweet and toasty vanilla to the extended, rich finish."
Blackbird Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.78,123.89,9,"This is a very approachable and tasty wine, especially for a grape that can be so tannic when young. Aromas of cola, chopped mint and cherries translate to a fruity and minty palate, with just enough tannins, a nice acidic spice and a bit of woodiness on the finish. It's very well measured."
Blackbird Vineyards,Red Blend,91.67,54.0,3,"From a selection of vineyard sites and clones, this wine offers juicy acidity behind a wave of plummy red and black cherry, an earthy foundation keeping things real. Oak and tannins are well integrated, and plenty of clove flavor make for a spicy finish. This gets extra attention for the awesome label."
Blackbird Vineyards,Rosé,89.67,25.0,3,"A small-production blend of 86% Zinfandel with 14% Petite Sirah, this was aged over a year in a small percentage of new oak. Dry and structured, it's a celebration of chocolate, leather and blackberry, the fruit sizably ripe yet kept in check. Drink now through 2018."
Blackbird Vineyards,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,87.5,32.0,2,"Plummy and tight, this wine comes from the Green Valley section of the Russian River Valley. Youthful, it hints at fierce acidity around delicately woven specks of mint, pine forest, rhubarb and clove. In the background, the region's classic cola cherry characteristic shows as well. Drink now through 2021."
Blackjack,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,75.0,1,"This behemoth is all gristle and power, voluptuously combining 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Malbec, 9% Petit Verdot, 5% Merlot, 4% Syrah and 2% Carmenere in a mad scientist's way. Velvety, it's beyond full-bodied in blackberry and chocolate, integrated in terms of oak, with a splash of black pepper and tobacco on the finish. Drink now through 2022."
Blackjack,Chardonnay,89.0,48.0,1,"Generous aromas like ripe berries and vanilla get this full-bodied wine off to a good start.Next, the flavors chime in with harmonious blackberry, black cherry and baking-spice notes. The texture is suave and nicely tannic, and a tasty, spicy effect lasts on the finish. The wine is made with 46% Merlot, plus Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec."
Blackjack,Merlot,90.0,45.0,1,"This wine is principally Merlot (57%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (33%) along with pinches of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Dark fruit, fresh herb and abundant barrel-spice aromas are followed by bountiful, restrained black-fruit flavors that carry through the finish."
Blackjack,Pinot Noir,93.0,65.0,1,"From a p of Sonoma Mountain exposed to the Petaluma Gap, this wine is spicy in cinnamon and cola, its oak profile reduced and intense. Roses and cherries provide the floral and the fruit around deeper, darker tendencies into Asian spice and black tea. Drink now through 2021."
Blair,Chardonnay,91.33,701.0,3,"A 100% varietal wine from the winery property, certified organic to boot, this is classic in cedar, currant and a freshness of blackberry. Vibrant acidity on the palate balances out the tightness of new oak. It captures the dustiness known to the appellation as well."
Blair,Pinot Noir,90.2,44.4,5,"Aromas of blackberry, black currant, cinnamon and dark plum lead to high toned herbal, green olive, licorice and barrel spice grace notes. The black fruit flavors are forward and concentrated, with smoked meat on the finish."
Blakeslee,Chardonnay,90.0,45.0,1,"Exotic, complex and vivid aromas, rich and fulfilling fruit flavors and a hefty structure form a great package in this full-bodied and extroverted wine. The winemaker allowed wild yeast and kept 30% whole clusters in the fermentation, then aged it in neutral barrels."
Blakeslee,Pinot Noir,90.33,42.83,6,"Floral notes, as well as hints of lemon, pear and pineapple introduce this high-acid white. It's full-bodied on the palate, and intense and well integrated, with a finish that's delightfully spicy with ginger."
Blanc de Bleu,Sparkling Blend,82.5,20.0,2,"This 2011 Lola is light and creamy, with hints of buttered apple, from aging in 18% new French oak. It finishes soft, supple and lightly spiced."
Block Nine,Pinot Noir,86.5,14.5,2,"Pleasing toasty notes greet your first sniff, followed by apple pie fruit flavors with hints of plum and banana. It's a light, creamy, easy-drinking confection."
Block Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,55.0,1,"Fermented with 30% whole clusters and aged 20 months in neutral French oak, this is a distinctive wine with notes reminiscent of sage along with white pepper, violets and a tinge of copper. Designed for the dinner table, the palate is lighter in style with tart acidity."
Block Wines,Grenache,92.0,37.5,2,"McCay is a producer to watch in Lodi and this wine is a perfect example of why. A blend of four different Zinfandels and Petite Sirah, it opens with a nose of baked blackberry clafouti with a bit of hazelnut and almond, a still-tight wine that with air shows a ton of structure and layered tannins."
Block Wines,Pinot Noir,89.0,25.0,1,"Dusty and toasty aromas over sweet plum fruit, with a streak of mocha running sharply down the center. Svelt and open, yet still sharp and showing a little bite in the back."
Block Wines,Syrah,92.5,50.0,2,"Cherries and chocolate are the hallmark of the Zins at Maryhill. The fruit is pretty and the chocolate smooth, certainly a crowd-pleasing style. The finish is clean and supple."
Block Wines,Sémillon,88.0,20.0,1,"At first this comes across as being a bit heavy, yeasty and tight. With time, however, this should be full of bramble-fruit flavors. This is a well-crafted wine, with structure and elegance that should start to show in 3–5 years."
Bloomer Creek,Chardonnay,83.0,18.0,1,"This is a fresh and forward effort that's based on all six Bordeaux grapes. It bears pretty plum and cherry flavors, with a chocolaty wash over the quick finish."
Blue Farm,Chardonnay,93.75,60.0,4,"Tighter blackberry and blueberry fruits meet with a touch of fennel on this nose of this appellation blend by Billy Wathen and Dick Dore. Flavors range from refreshing blackberry soda to root beer and cola, achieving a measure of elegance thanks to dill, tomato leaf and a tannic grip."
Blue Farm,Pinot Noir,92.22,77.78,9,"This is a really well-made, traditional and tasty wine with flavor complexity, nice balance and the kind of firm texture that pairs well with grilled and roasted meats. The fruit characteristics of the grape—cherry and cranberry—meld easily with a modest touch of spicy oak from aging in barrels."
Blue Moon,Riesling,84.5,11.0,2,"All aged in single-use French oak, this offers pleasing nuances of corn on the cob, spice, mineral and chamomile. The prickly pear flavors are both elegantly styled and well balanced."
Blue Oak,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,55.0,1,"This wine was barrel-aged for 36 months and saw additional time in bottle prior to release. It displays brooding aromas of vanilla, cranberry, cherry, woodspice and light meaty notes. The palate is densely packed with tart cranberry flavors backed by firm, somewhat dry tannins."
Blue Plate,Chenin Blanc,88.0,11.0,2,"Though this wine was aged in just 26% new oak (French and American), the wood makes the first impression. Aromas of caramel, coffee and vanilla extract fare are followed by dark fruit and spices. Flavors are rich, hedonistic and sweet, supported by firm, somewhat rustic tannins."
Blue Rock,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,95.0,1,"Rich in leather and oak, with swirls of ripe red raspberry and blackberry cobbler, this is a big-boy Zinfandel with hair on its chest, a taste of vanilla on the finish."
Blue Rock,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,88.0,24.0,1,"This wine has a bright cherry character in the aromas and flavors along with medium body and a dry, firm texture. Lighter than many of its peers, but still cloaked in lots of fine tannins, it will improve with time. Wait until 2020."
Board Track Racer,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,20.0,1,"Coming on stiff and herbal, the Croft needs some time and patience. There are not quite resolved streaks of citrus, cherries, earthy tannins and a touch of cocoa powder. Still a baby, this should improve over the next three to five years."
Board Track Racer,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,28.0,2,"This nicely rich and rounded wine smells like vanilla and toasted bread. The flavors are ripe and black-cherry-like, with a hint of chocolate and baking spices that comes from oak. It's medium bodied and easy to like."
Board Track Racer,Red Blend,88.33,21.67,3,"This sports a blue label, to differentiate it from the winery's estate bottling. It's dark and toasty, with robust black-cherry fruit, along with strong notes of charcoal, espresso and vanilla. There's nothing subtle here, but should work well with Korean ribs."
Board Track Racer,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,25.0,1,"Wonderful blackberry and ripe grape flavors fill up this big but smooth new wine under country-music star Zac Brown's label. It has a very dark color, jammy aromas, rather sweet flavors and a velvety texture with enough tannin to keep it appetizing."
Bodega de Edgar,Albariño,90.0,24.0,1,"A juicy, jammy blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Montepulciano and 8% Zinfandel sourced primarily from Contra Costa County that's packed with blue and blackberry fruit, tobacco and plum. Clean and bright with a chewy texture."
Bodega de Edgar,Mourvèdre,93.0,38.0,1,"Mango, presumably, is the dog pictured on the label. This is a heavily-extracted, somewhat bitter Merlot, with fruit flavors of blackberry syrup, alcohol at 15%, and still a fair amount of green bitterness to the tannins. Notes of iodine and anise come into play in the finish."
Bodega de Edgar,Red Blend,92.0,48.0,2,"Released young, this fresh and citrusy wine is all about the fruit. Full in the mouth, it quickly settles into a cherry vanilla mid-palate, and sails on through a clean finish."
Bodega de Edgar,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,48.0,1,"The 2010 Sauce is three quarters Merlot, with Syrah and Malbec filling in the rest. It's a simple, accessible red blend, with accents of cut tobacco over black cherry fruit."
Bodega de Edgar,Tempranillo,93.0,38.0,1,"Aromatic with crushed rock, raspberry, cranberry and hints of clove, this well-structured wine—53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 21% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot—will reward additional bottle age. The young, tart red fruits are steely and precise, the barrel influence perfectly balanced against the natural acidity."
Bodkin,Chardonnay,90.0,32.0,1,"For the first time this reserve-level Gamache Cabernet includes grapes from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard as well as both the Champoux and estate vineyards. It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination. Powerful, sleek, dense and textural, the wine explodes from the glass, muscular and thick with black fruits and ripe tannins. Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish."
Bodkin,Gewürztraminer,90.0,22.0,1,"Modest citrus, earth and almond notes come up from the glass, and continue in the flavors of this smooth, rounded, and straightforward wine. The balance is on the soft side, and the body is quite light."
Bodkin,Red Blend,86.0,28.0,1,"Earthy, vegetal aromas and equally earthy, peppery flavors make this wine unusually rustic. It does have traces of good aged character, like leather and tea."
Bodkin,Sauvignon Blanc,91.2,23.0,5,"This is an unusual mix of disparate flavors—some spice, some mint, eucalyptus, lemon, pineapple—all with a rather bitter edge. It falls apart on the finish, with a chemical, paint thinner aftertaste."
Bodkin,Syrah,93.0,19.0,2,"Yes, this does not shy away from the herbal bite often found in Oregon Pinot. But that accent is nicely integrated into a firm, balanced wine with penetrating red fruits and darker notes of black coffee, black licorice and a whiff of fresh truffle."
Bodkin,Zinfandel,91.0,21.5,2,"With its aromas of citrus and honey and its exuberant flavors of tropical fruit and toasted spice, this is both pretty and playful. Sweet but full of finesse, the wine has floral element that adds to its allure."
Boedecker Cellars,Chardonnay,88.0,19.0,2,"This is a perfectly drinkable wine, with good fruit from a great vineyard. It's a bit minty and chalky; let's say rustic. The mixed flavors border on the lightly vegetal side of cool-climate fruit; not sweet but firm."
Boedecker Cellars,Pinot Gris,88.0,18.0,1,"Among the single-vineyard 2008 Pinots from Rex Hill, this is the lightest in flavor and style. Ripe strawberry fruit, medium-bodied, is buttressed with generous natural acidity. Highlights of fresh-cut herbs dot the finish."
Boedecker Cellars,Pinot Noir,88.0,39.0,14,"For $9 a nice wine in a nice package, made from old-vine Zinfandel from Lodi. The red fruit on the nose pops out pleasantly followed by smooth tannins and a fruity, chocolaty mix of flavors."
Boeger,Pinot Noir,89.33,22.0,3,"The estate reserve is simply a barrel selection that the winery feels represents the top 10% of their estate-grown Pinot Noir. Basically it offers quite similar flavors; for the extra money you get more butterfat, more cherry fruit and a little less herb. What it gains in power, the wine loses in detail and nuance; depending upon your own palate preferences, the regular estate might be the better value."
Boeger,Red Blend,89.0,30.0,2,"This wine has that wonderful but hard-to-pin-down Zinfandel essence that's extremely fruity but also uniquely spicy and brambly. It blends together ripe raspberry, creamy vanilla and red cherry on a smooth, nicely viscous and very full-bodied frame that helps the finish linger."
Boeger,Rosé,87.0,16.0,2,"High-toned aromas of cocoa, barrel spice, vanilla and dark fruit lead to plentiful, focused fruit and barrel flavors. The flavors linger on the finish."
Boeger,Zinfandel,90.14,18.14,7,"Comprised of 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Merlot, this is a juicy, savory and lengthy wine, with herbaceous elements of cedar, brush and peppercorn. A lush, full-bodied complement of baked plum and cherry ride out a lengthy finish."
Boekenoogen,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.5,49.0,2,"Light in color and body, this is a cool-climate-influenced wine full of spice and life. It offers a mixture of rhubarb, strawberry and black tea, dusted in cardamom. The wine's spicy tones carry through to the medium-length finish."
Boekenoogen,Chardonnay,89.33,35.33,6,"The winery's annual stainless-steel bottling, this is showy rather than reserved, with ripe Asian pear, tropical flowers, sweet apple blossoms, pineapple and a bit of vanilla on the nose. Nicely fresh, it's bright on the palate, with a sizzle of acidity and grippy chalkiness that frame the poached-pear palate."
Boekenoogen,Petite Sirah,88.0,35.0,1,"Fresh aromas, vivid citrus flavors, elegance and poise make this an attractive wine. It has a balance that is easy to enjoy and keeps calling for more sips, with pleasant notes of citrus and green fruit throughout."
Boekenoogen,Pinot Noir,92.62,49.92,13,"Deep color and lots of concentration make this full-bodied wine stand out. It has smoky, black-peppery aromas along with ripe but not sweet blackberry and black-cherry flavors. Firm tannins add texture. This boldness needs rich food for a pairing."
Boekenoogen,Syrah,91.5,32.0,2,"Toast with apricot jam comes first to mind in this nicely balanced white that begins in richness and evolves in the glass to offer a freshness of lime zest and grapefruit, the minerality well-defined."
Boekenoogen,Viognier,88.33,34.0,3,"This is a very light expression of the grape from a San Francisco-based producer, with thyme, chaparral, cranberry, tart pomegranate juice and wet clay on the nose. The palate shows light, tangy cherry juice, fennel, crushed olive and peppery spice. It will work well for fans of this style, but there's not enough there to entertain the mainstream Pinot Noir fan."
Boekenoogen,Zinfandel,90.0,42.0,2,"This is an impressive blend of 45% Merlot with 25% estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah from Stagecoach Vineyard and 10% Biale Zinfandel. It comes together seamlessly in a twist of structured blackberry, leathery tannin and tomato leaf, priced to be enjoyed by many."
Boeschen Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.0,150.0,1,"Tight and nicely constructed, this is not afraid to show its herbal side. Tannins are earthy and firm, the fruit tight and focused, and the wine might benefit from a few more years in the bottle. What's already there is cassis, tar and earth, finishing with a light but balanced fade."
Boeschen Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,95.0,1,"From the Evergreen Vineyard, in the Ancient Lakes region north of the Wahluke Slope, this is surprisingly high-powered, at 13.9% alcohol, with a big smack of oak in the nose. That oak is wrapped around green banana and green apple fruit, with a little vanilla on the side. As young as it is, it seems likely to knit together and improve over the next year or two."
Boeschen Vineyards,Petit Verdot,94.0,95.0,1,"At just 12.5% alcohol, this comes across as dry and quite fresh, with vivid grapefruit flesh and acidity. Some mint and lemon flavors sneak in also. The emphasis is clearly on citrus rather than peach or apricot; a fine food wine."
Boete,Cabernet Franc,90.0,42.0,3,"The finest Gamache Cabernet Franc since the 2008, this is arguably the best value in the winery's entire lineup. There's excellent varietal character on display, a mix of blueberries and coffee grounds, and the overall balance is improved by virtue of the cooler 2011 vintage, keeping alcohol levels in check."
Boete,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,40.0,1,"Plum, sassafras and dark cherry form a contingency of flavor in this brooding, velvety smooth wine with a sizable finish. Cinnamon and clove are peppered throughout this full-bodied, well-made effort from the famous vineyard site."
Bogle,Chardonnay,91.0,20.0,2,"Ripe blueberries, toasted oak, caramel, brown coffee, black pepper and crushed grape seeds combine for a pleasant smoke and fruit combo on the nose of this bottling. There is a nice chalky texture on the energetic palate, where dense elderberry and blackberry notes meet with tobacco ash flavors."
Bogle,Red Blend,90.5,13.0,4,"Plum clafouti and a marriage of cherry and clove provide a foundation above which lies a spicy mix of dried herb and cedar in this integrated, softly approachable wine of medium-build and length."
Bogle,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,10.0,1,"From a replanted single vineyard, single clone site, the first vintage since that replanting in 2009, there's a youthful awkwardness still at play here, though the wine is quite juicy in black cherry and a lingering suggestion of soy. The oak and tannin are fairly firm and pronounced."
Bogle,Zinfandel,89.0,12.0,1,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (91%) along with pinches of Syrah and Merlot. The aromas of espresso, coffee grounds, fresh herbs and cherry pop, but don't always seem entirely harmonious. The black fruit flavors are more reserved than the aromas might suggest but still deliver."
Boheme,Chardonnay,90.25,45.0,4,"This wine surprises in its sanguine nature, dusted in currant and cranberry, with a dustiness to the firm, but not overbearing tannins. Structured and light-bodied in an elegant way, it remains lively in the glass."
Boheme,Pinot Noir,92.56,53.22,9,"From an appellation better known for Zin, this blend of 41% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc, 21% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot works well—a study in chocolate-covered blackberry and blueberry with a powerful firmness balanced by moderate acidity."
Boheme,Syrah,94.0,49.0,1,"This winery is one of the region's bright spots, in this case offering expertly layered touches of vanilla, caramel, cappuccino, blueberry and a touch of oregano in the blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 13% Cabernet Franc, 8% Malbec and 7% Petit Verdot. Cocoa nibs, coffee, black cherry, dill, bay leaf and black olive pop on the palate, where the lingering acidity ensures aging potential."
Bokisch,Garnacha,91.0,18.0,1,"This blend of 71% Grenache and 29% Syrah is lively with smashed strawberries and cherries on the nose as well as stewed beef, lilacs and berry-laced pastries. Black plums and cherries show on the sip, held up by tart plum skins, rose hips and lilac flavors, rounded by a sprinkling of brown sugar."
Bokisch,Graciano,92.0,21.0,1,"Fresh and light in aroma, crisp and delicate in flavor, this wine is light-bodied, well-balanced and attractively restrained in character. Because of all that it will be extremely versatile with food—everything from shucked oysters to Thai food to smoked salmon."
Bokisch,Monastrell,91.0,21.0,2,"Half Viognier with the rest equal parts Marsanne and Roussanne, it's aromatically expressive with notes of lime zest, honeysuckle, almond and white peach. The palate is flavorful yet delicate, showing an exquisite sense of balance that carries through the lingering finish. It's subtle but if you pick up its nuances, there are plenty to find."
Bokisch,Verdejo,89.0,18.0,1,"There's a very savory, gamy element on the nose of this wine, which shows wild berries, woody shrubs, rusty iron and turned forest-floor aromas. The palate is punchy at first, with decent acidity and cranberry-plum-raspberry flavors, then clings to a pencil-lead core deeper into the sip. It offers quite a bit of complexity."
Bomb,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.67,50.0,3,"Mineral, mulberry, dried herb and black-fruit aromas lead to layered dark-fruit flavors that show intensity as well as exceptional balance. This has a delicious factor that is impossible to ignore."
Bonair,Cabernet Franc,90.0,15.0,1,"Brilliant strawberry and raspberry aromas, bright and effusive fruit flavors, and a sense of freshness and purity make this wine from one of El Dorado County's oldest wineries a pleasure to drink. It's full bodied, has a smooth texture, mild tannins and a lingering finish."
Bonair,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.33,30.0,3,"Intoxicating aromas of plum jelly, violets, blueberry, chocolate and cinnamon are cut with a pencil-lead focus on this bottling by a family in the Paso wine game since 1908. Flavors of blackberry jelly are lifted by lavender and anise spice."
Bonair,Chardonnay,88.5,20.0,2,"From a steep hillside vineyard that is estate owned and farmed, this wine is pungent in dark fruit and black tea. Elusive at first, it takes time to open and reveal classic Sebastopol Hills elements of earth and black cherry, finishing awash in cardamon."
Bonair,Gewürztraminer,86.5,13.0,2,"Very light pink, this rosé offers extremely pleasant and approachable aromas of nectarine, pluot, plum, lime and a dusting of vanilla. These give way to a light and bright palate, where lime zest cuts through a bubble gum core. Yeasty notes adds further nuance."
Bonair,Malbec,87.5,24.0,2,"Light and smoothly textured, this beautifully crafted wine is earthy in wild strawberry preserves, mushroom and forest floor. With a tannic grip that subsides in the glass, it's built to age but entirely enjoyable now, showing power and concentration on the finish."
Bonair,Merlot,87.0,19.67,3,"Very light in the glass, this wine by regional Sauv Blanc veteran Kathy Joseph offers cut green apples, sweet lime blossoms and a light honey element on the nose. Lime zest and citrus pith decorate the palate, with steely white pepper and dried oregano flavors that race across the tense palate."
Boneshaker,Zinfandel,87.0,25.0,1,"Dark loam and a slate-driven minerality restrain the concentrated black raspberry and black currant ripeness on the nose of this elegant wine, made by a Sonoma-based group co-founded in 1972 by a descendant of tractor-maker John Deere. Lots of eucalyptus and purple sage shrubbery on the palate spices up the soft, luscious blackberry and olallieberry fruit core."
Bonneau,Chardonnay,87.0,34.0,1,"This wine from an extreme coastal vineyard is framed by earthy notes of turned black loam as well as a cherry blossom ripeness, with a laid-back sagebrush element and touch of olive. There's a lot of thyme and marjoram on the palate, as well as orange rinds, plum peel, barely ripe cranberry fruit and a graphite tension."
Bonneau,Pinot Noir,85.0,42.0,1,"Dried cherries, cocoa dust, flinty gunmetal, worn leather and pressed rose petals show on the nose of this blend of Petite Sirah, Syrah and Grenache. The palate surrounds a dense core of minted blackberry fruit, with lifting dill and a chunk of fudge rounding out a very nice flavor set."
Bonny Doon,Claret,90.0,16.0,1,"Ah, the beautiful fruit aromas, polished texture, ripe but tangy flavors and supreme balance make this an elegant and delicious wine. This is not showy, but slightly reserved, as very little spicy oak is showing through, yet the wine's vibrance and purity keep begging for another sip."
Bonny Doon,Grenache,90.0,20.0,2,"Tight blueberry, hot blacktop and a flash of purple flowers combine for an earth-driven nose on this wine from a hot region in southern Monterey County. The flavors are quite distinctive, with barely ripe mulberries, cedar-edged blackberries, sandalwood shavings and a touch of graphite."
Bonny Doon,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,59.9,10,"High-intensity and reflective of its mountainous heritage, this 100% varietal wine is elegant and velvety, despite its thick tannin structure. It offers equal components of berry pie, black pepper and cardamon. Smooth on the palate, it's ready now, well made and in balance."
Bonny Doon,Rhône-style White Blend,90.0,35.0,5,"A frankly sweet wine, this has a deep pink color, simple floral and fruity aromas and a smooth, soft texture."
Bonny Doon,Rosé,89.0,18.0,2,"This is a 100% varietal wine, with a dullness to the nose and a simplicity to the palate that makes it hard to distinguish, the fruit and acidity diluted."
Bonny Doon,Sparkling Blend,87.0,36.0,1,"Fresh wild berry and Concord grape aromas meet with dark lavender, black tea and crushed slate on the nose of this blend of 51% Merlot, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 5% Malbec and 4% Petit Verdot. Boysenberry syrup meets with pencil shavings on the palate."
Bonny Doon,Syrah,92.33,42.0,3,"From one of the Riboli family's new estate vineyards, this bottling is a clean but quite ripe style of Viognier, with blousy aromas of tuberose, coconut and guava. It's tighter on the palate, with honeydew, key lime and guava sorbet flavors."
Bonny Doon,White Blend,88.0,16.0,3,"Quite yellow in the glass, this solid bottling of a tough-to-master grape shows rich aromas of dried lemon peel, beeswax, smoke, nut oil and sandstone on the nose. The viscous palate offers dried pears, seared lemons and a hint of salinity—elements that will continue to converge and gain nuance with cellar time."
Bonterra,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,16.0,2,"Dried herb aromas are at the fore, along with notes of flowers and red fruit. The palate is full of medium-bodied fruit and savory flavors that bring a lightly tacky lip-smacking feel. It's hard to place it as Grenache exactly but it brings enjoyment all the same."
Bonterra,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,14.0,2,"This wine is a blend of 52% Syrah, 26% Mourvèdre and 22% Grenache. Aromas of black licorice, herb, barrel spice and cassis are out front. The palate is chock-full of black fruit flavors that bring a dry, lightly astringent feel."
Bonterra,Viognier,89.0,14.0,1,"Sturdy and flavorful, this is a well-made, dry and moderately tannic wine that smells beefy, salt-and-peppery, and tastes juicy like raspberries and cherries with a little bit of meatiness coming through for complexity. The texture has good grip and acidity so the wine will pair well with big proteins."
Bontzu,Grenache,90.0,60.0,1,"Minty bay leaf and leather define this wine in a savory, earthy way, with a strong notion of forest floor at its core. Firm tannins and subtle oak contribute a leathery aspect to the texture."
Bookwalter,Chardonnay,88.0,20.0,1,"From coastal hills near Jenner, this is true Sonoma Coast fruit, and it shows in its cool-climate embrace of red fruit and white pepper. Leather saddle marks the personality of the texture and soft acidity keeps it full-bodied and relatively dense."
Borjón,Barbera,90.4,45.2,5,"This single clone, single-block wine offers a well-defined, tight and concentrated streak of pretty cherry fruit. It's underpinned with minerality, and carries on through a clear, crisp finish."
Borjón,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,65.0,1,"This is a fun, flavorful blend of 63% Merlot, 14% Syrah, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec. Soft, juicy red fruit meets sizable tannin and leathery oak laced in vanilla."
Borjón,Petite Sirah,93.0,25.0,1,"Mild red fruit is met by soft texture in this ripe, tart and moderately bodied wine. Cranberry and strawberry flavors are buoyed by fresh acidity and weight."
Borjón,Primitivo,88.0,24.0,1,"Yeasty with aromas of beer batter, this is an interestingly robust wine, concentrated in blackberry and dark cherry with undertones of tar and bitterroot."
Borjón,Red Blend,87.0,45.0,1,"Ripe and tropical in pineapple, papaya and guava, this is a medium-bodied style of the variety, lightly oaked, which shows tart lemon on the finish and a lingering accent of anise. It is a screaming deal for the price."
Borjón,Rosé,87.0,17.0,1,"This is a light-bodied, lightly textured wine from one of the producer's coolest sites, minty and herbal in a taste of forest floor and strawberry. Citrus and pomegranate provide additional crispness and freshness on the palate."
Borjón,Sangiovese,89.5,24.5,2,"This blends a majority Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot, coaxing soft, rounded texture and substantial flavors of red berry and vanilla. With a density on the palate, it carries with it a streak of smoked meat."
Borjón,Zinfandel,86.0,20.0,2,"This dark, ripe wine combines 73% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot, 10% Zinfandel and 4% Petit Verdot. Together they form an alliance of black cherry, blackberry jam and clove, richly rounded and expressive."
Borra,Barbera,89.0,25.0,1,"This is a full-bodied, ripe wine, moderate in acidity, that reveals a wealth of baked plum and cinnamon in the glass. Along the way it meets a pine forest of savory companionship, finishing in youthful tannin."
Borra,Gewürztraminer,91.0,19.0,1,"Smoky oak supports a simple, supple texture of blackberry and tobacco in this likable wine from both counties, a good value for the quality and tailor-made for the table."
Borra,Red Blend,88.0,27.2,10,"This is a challenging wine, but it takes bravery to make Pinot Grigio like a red wine, using amphorae and terra cotta along the way. It's pink, but not a rose. Zesty aromas of tangerine, wet stone and grapefruit skins also show a bit of yeast. There is strong kumquat tang to the sip, which is fairly sour without the ripeness one might expect from the color."
Borra,Syrah,85.0,35.0,1,"Clean if slightly sweet notes of apple, Meyer lemon pith, honeydew melon, peach blossom and bubblegum show on the nose of this bottling. It's quite light on the palate, with touches of light pear and apple, with that bubblegum touch arising as well."
Borra,Vermentino,86.0,22.0,1,"Green apple shines through in this light-bodied sparkler, which adds a note of strawberry midway through. Crisp and moderately complex, it's an enjoyable quaffer, that finishes in a flourish of vanilla and shortcake."
Borra,White Blend,88.83,19.17,6,"Sugary, volatile, with flavors of prune and brown sugar. No finesse at all."
Borrellie,Chardonnay,87.0,15.0,1,"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay cloaks its thin fruit in aggressive flavors of wood and butter. The wine itself is soft and watery, quickly disappearing into a frail finish."
Borrellie,Pinot Noir,88.0,25.0,1,"Pleasing aromas of cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, dried herbs and plum lead to black-currant flavors that display a reserved styling. A light grip of tannins provides the frame."
Bota Box,Red Blend,86.0,23.0,3,"High-toned aromas of raspberries, mint, nori and green herbs are followed by black-tea flavors and slightly gritty-feeling tannins. It brings appeal but the variety seems hard to find."
Bota Box,Rosé,87.0,25.0,1,"Aromas of dried herbs intertwine with dill, vanilla and other barrel spices on this blend. The cranberry flavors have a tart zing, with slightly drying tannins providing the frame."
Bota Box,Zinfandel,84.0,23.0,1,"From the producer's sloping vineyard at a 750-foot elevation in the eastern section of the appellation, this wine also contains 4% Malbec from the same site. Earthy in stewed mushrooms, grilled meat and bouillon, it's a bold, dense powerhouse of a wine, with a tobacco-laden finish."
Bouchaine,Chardonnay,89.0,30.0,2,"Blackberry and black-currant aromas are fresh and bright, with herbal notes providing accents. The sweet flavors are plump and fruit-forward. This wine doesn't provide a lot of complexity but brings plenty of easy-drinking pleasure."
Bouchaine,Pinot Meunier,88.0,40.0,1,"The berry, herb and coffee aromas are light and are followed by high-toned potpourri notes. It's full in feel but with lighter-styled flavors, with the tannins showing some astringency."
Bouchaine,Pinot Noir,88.12,48.0,8,"Salmon-pink in color, this easy-to-enjoy sparkling wine is nutty in aroma, and plush in acid-driven layers of wild strawberry and raspberry flavors. Dry, it's made by Rack and Riddle winemaker Penny Gadd-Coster in a méthode Champenoise style."
Boudreaux Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,100.0,3,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot, all from Burgess Vineyard. The aromas display each variety in turn, with notes of high-toned herbs followed by plum and dried cherries. Tart flavors show a focus on acid, and are far more elegant in style than most wines from this vintage."
Boudreaux Cellars,Chardonnay,91.0,35.0,3,"Very light, this is scented with fresh bread dough and shows a cherry soda pop flavor. Pretty, light and simple on entry, it feels stripped of depth and disappears quickly in the mouth."
Boudreaux Cellars,Red Blend,93.0,60.0,1,"Aromas like cedar and heavily toasted bread meet very ripe black cherry and plum flavors, for a full-bodied wine that's not shy about the oak influence. While the wine is big, the texture is rather soft and smooth."
Boudreaux Cellars,Syrah,87.0,60.0,1,"The flavors of this medium-bodied wine are hearty, with bell pepper, black pepper and green olive notes, and in this vein it's tasty and fairly concentrated. The balance is good, the palate sensation is nicely dry and the finish lingers a bit."
Bougetz,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.75,66.5,4,"Big, smoky fruit and a nicely honed structure combine well in this full-bodied wine with touches of red cherry and berry and toasted wood."
Bougetz,Pinot Noir,88.33,39.0,3,"There's a touch of reduction on the nose of this wine, which otherwise offers a nutty profile that's somewhat shut down. Oaky and smoky, it has a bit of minty chocolate on the thick, full-bodied palate."
Bouké,Red Blend,87.0,21.0,1,"Fermented in both oak and stainless steel, this serviceable white is salty and smooth, with plenty of Gravenstein apple on offer. Lingering acidity keeps it crisp and refreshing, before there's a touch of buttery oak."
Boyle MacDonald,Rosé,88.0,16.0,1,"This very floral and herbally tinged bottling shows fresh crushed thyme, black peppercorns, lavender and woody blackberries on the nose. The palate shows some of the same, but descends into a very purple Concord grape flavor."
Boëté,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,30.0,1,"Luxuriously crafted to be lush and robust, this blends 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay with ease and gusto. The palate is dominated by layered flavors of baked strawberry and cherry."
Boëté,Cabernet Franc,88.0,40.0,1,"It's great to return to an excellent honest-tasting fruit-driven wine that has very good balance, an appetizing texture thanks to fine-grained tannins and light spicy elements to complement the pure cherry and berry core. It's the kind of wine that doesn't get tiring, and will be ideal to stock up on."
Boëté,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,36.0,1,"Big in flavor and structure, this dark-colored, full-bodied wine is concentrated and laced with fine-grained tannins to support rich blackberry flavors. It's smooth and mouthfilling, with a lingering finish."
Bradford Mountain,Syrah,86.0,32.0,1,"Dried herb, graphite and cedar form a cast of characters around a big powerful tannin concentration in this appellation wine. A bitter streak of tobacco plays games with sharper, crunchier aspects of cassis and clove."
Bradford Mountain,Zinfandel,87.0,32.0,1,"There's a slight, lithe line of butterscotch on the nose of this bottling, with lots of lemon blossoms and Meyer lemon juice overshadowing the buttery aspect. The palate is tart in green apple and Anjou pear flavors, followed by honeydew and white peach."
Bradley,Riesling,87.0,16.0,2,"Black cherry and black currant open the nose on this bottling, but there are more savory components of soy and black pepper lurking in the background. The palate is lively with black raspberry before the chalky, still quite stiff tannins arise, carrying flashes of cigar box, pencil shavings and bittersweet chocolate."
Brady Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,84.0,35.0,1,"This wine starts with a creamy nose of apricot, banana and orangesicle but then a more oxidative quality comes through of slightly sour guava and pineapple. It's tight and tart on the sip, combining banana, guava and macadamia nut richness with grapefruit peel sourness. It's an interesting and unique wine."
Brady Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,35.0,1,"This is a powerhouse of a wine, from a tremendous coastal site, situated within a blanket of forest at 1,200-feet elevation. Reductive notes of diesel oak give way to juicy, stemmy and grippy characteristics, marked most pronounced by flavors of black cherry, raspberry and black tea."
Brandborg,Pinot Noir,88.0,28.22,9,"This bottling explores the more concentrated side of Pinot Noir, with hearty aromas of balsamic fig sauce, cooked berries, clove and rum cake. Roasted blackberry clusters and charred figs show on the sip alongside potent baking spices, making for a rich and heavy expression, although leveling acidity pounds into the finish."
Brander,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,35.0,1,"This suave-textured and lavishly fruity wine combines a rich baking-spice aroma, with saturated blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel of this Bordeaux-style blend is smooth and creamy and the finish is long."
Brander,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.33,50.0,3,"Starts off with softly perfumed cherries and dried leaves, then turns strongly piny on the palate. Finishes long, with tart cranberry and bitter-chocolate notes. Some excellent elements, including a lush yet structured mouthfeel, but some tasters will find the intense pine-bough flavor distracting."
Brander,Sauvignon Blanc,88.83,26.33,6,"Snappy and full of raspberry and cedar aromas. It’s mouthfilling and juicy, with a stylish lean edge to it. Puckery on the palate, with a right-on mix of acidity, fruit and oak. It delivers the goods, not missing a twist or turn along the way, and in the final analysis, it’s fairly large, packing a solid punch of berry fruit."
Brander,Syrah,89.0,32.0,1,"Each year Rich gets his grapes from different sources: This time it’s Corral Creek, and the wine’s tight as a drum, emphasizing cranberry and pie cherries. It isn’t sour, but it is tart. The gorgeous nose and precise, powerful red-berry fruit make it pleasurable. Puckering acids say it should be served with food."
Brander,White Blend,91.0,18.0,1,"For those who like their Pinot oaky, this may be just the ticket. It starts out with caramel, coffee and chocolate aromas skillfully matched with sour cherries and a bouquet garni of green herbs. It then turns ever oakier on the palate, with a near-syrupy mouthfeel. Finishes with toasty oak-driven spice notes and an herbaceous edge."
Brandlin,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,98.0,1,"Chocolate and plum mingle enticingly in this medium-bodied offering from the warm (relative to Willamette) Umpqua Valley. Subtle herb notes and a peppery, crisp finish keep this wine interesting from start to finish."
Brandlin,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,60.0,1,"This organic bottling marks Cooper’s 20th year, and it’s a tantalizing, high-strung, dusty wine, with a true Pinot nose full of raspberries and cinnamon. Plenty of verve on the palate, which emphasizes fruit and more fruit. The frame is sleek, but it capably carries the wine’s zip."
Brave & Maiden,Cabernet Franc,89.0,45.0,1,"Smells like a briar patch under summer sun, with accents of leather and tomato. The pungent aromatics fade into a weighty mouthfeel. It’s all red berries, and it’s tight and young. Shows fine structure and a pure quality. A very likable wine."
Brave & Maiden,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.33,65.0,3,"Rustic, with some smoke and char up front that gives way to intense berry flavors. It’s a touch idiosyncratic—it’s very concentrated and a bit sauvage—as it shows a lot of vineyard individuality. Hard and rugged now; a few years in the bottle should tame its power."
Brave & Maiden,Merlot,92.0,65.0,1,"All varietal, this offers aromas of coffee, cherry, chocolate, oak spices and green herbs that show a touch of underripeness. The palate displays elegance, restraint and polish along with a tart finish."
Brave & Maiden,Red Blend,91.0,30.0,1,"This wine is all from Underwood Mountain and shows perfumed aromas of grape skins, pear and apricot. It drinks medium sweet with abundant stone-fruit flavors."
Brave & Maiden,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,25.0,1,"More of a Zinfandel than a red blend, this has plenty of flavor and more tannin than usual. Containing 40% Petite Sirah, it offers a surplus of juicy plum and black cherry flavors, good balance and just enough grippy tannin to make it robust."
Brave & Maiden,Syrah,91.0,65.0,2,"This blend of 40% Mourvèdre, 30% Syrah, 21% Grenache and 9% Counoise shows a dense core of fruit on the fresh, tart nose, with blueberry, blackberry and boysenberry, as well as lava rocks and a licorice lift. The palate is all about texture, with good acidity and grip containing the purple fruit flavors"
Bravium,Chardonnay,88.0,34.0,1,"There are good things going on on this wine, with its aromas of leather and brown spices and sweet fruit flavors. However, they don't quite all seem to come together."
Bravium,Pinot Noir,87.0,24.0,1,"An extremely good deal, this wine will keep both neophytes and experts entertained, with aromas of black-plum jam, dark strawberries and graphite on the lively nose. The palate brings pungent blueberry and black cherry, along with crushed black-lava rocks and pencil shavings right down the middle."
Brazin,Zinfandel,87.5,17.0,4,"This full-bodied blockbuster strikes a good balance between very ripe, lavish fruit aromas and spicy oak and berry flavors and a sense of good structure. It has gobs of strawberry and mulberry, a light and lively texture despite the high alcohol, and lingering, almost sweet finish."
Bread & Butter,Pinot Noir,91.0,20.0,1,"A majority Cabernet Sauvignon, with 15% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc, this wine traffics in huge upfront tannins, accented by clove and dried herb. The power relents on the finish, ending soft."
Breathless,Chardonnay,92.0,32.0,1,"This is an unusual wine with aromas of damp herbs, bay leaf, chocolate and citrus. The flavors are sweet and chocolaty with a grainy feel."
Breathless,Pinot Gris,90.0,48.0,1,"This thick, rich and dense wine may need time to overcome its wealth of leathery sinew and black pepper. The fruit is elusive, allowing the savory elements to dominate all around. This may need cellaring to come around, through 2020."
Breathless,Sparkling Blend,88.83,27.83,12,"The producer's proprietary red Bordeaux-inspired blend is austere in this vintage, offering herbal thyme and cedar along with a sharp element of pencil lead. Medium bodied, the texture is velvety and lingering on the palate."
Brecon Estate,Albariño,90.0,28.0,1,"Cherry, cinnamon and vanilla play on the light-bodied, softly layered palate of this estate wine that develops flavor and aroma over time in the glass. Deeper, darker waves of boysenberry enter the picture toward the finish."
Brecon Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.5,59.0,4,"The old-vine estate vineyard delivers a well-balanced, elegant wine that shows mineral and steel along with tart berry fruit. Despite a much lighter vintage than 2012, there is enough density and depth to reward some additional cellar time."
Brecon Estate,Grenache,90.0,42.0,1,"This vineyard was developed between 10 and 20 years ago. The maturing vines deliver a supple yet firm wine, anchored in a core of candy cherry fruit. Aromatic and flavorful highlights of cinnamon, clove and candied orange are also in play, along with a subtle hint of herb."
Brecon Estate,Petite Sirah,93.0,59.0,1,"Roughly 75% of the fruit was fermented with the stems, using native yeast. The richly perfumed nose of this wine mixes floral tones with hints of body powder and a touch of cocoa. This is a sensuous wine, with a beguiling palate loaded with plum, cherry, mocha and sassafras."
Brecon Estate,Red Blend,92.0,42.0,1,"From a Ulises Valdez-farmed vineyard, along the same fence line as Valdez's Silver Eagle, this smoky, succulent wine has a reductive quality that will benefit from more time in bottle. Blackberry, strawberry and earth provide a fleshy aspect of intrigue. Cellar through 2023."
Brecon Estate,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.5,45.5,2,"Aromas of iced hibiscus tea with chopped spearmint come quickly to the nose on this wine, which also offers fresh cola, herbal smoke and red currant scents. The palate is packed with tarragon and fresh-cut herbs laced into cranberry-cherry juice, proving simultaneously light and leathery."
Brecon Estate,Tannat,88.0,49.0,1,"A barrel by barrel selection results in this reserve-level cuvée. Round, forward, spicy and toasty, it's a solid, almost chunky style with bold black-cherry fruit. Barrel aging brings up highlights of coffee and toast. Think duck confit with this bottle, and enjoy it over the next few years."
Brewer-Clifton,Chardonnay,91.78,62.56,9,"This wine's vividly layered nose blends dusty garden herbs of oregano and marjoram with hints of chile pepper, wet concrete and plum skins. The palate is supple and complex, showing dynamic spices and herbs, cut olives, savory meats and pipe smoke, much like a Middle Eastern tagine."
Brewer-Clifton,Pinot Noir,94.25,82.25,4,"With the goal of adding subtle aromatics and structure, this wine was given eight months in 50% new French oak puncheons, with the other 50% in neutral. The wine intrigues as much as refreshes, with crisp acidity and bright sparks of citrus prominent. Medium bodied, it has a complexity of baked apple and pear lurking in the background."
Brian Benson,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,92.0,50.0,1,"Translating to “The Boss's Red,” this blend of 50% Zinfandel and 50% Merlot is a bomber, with aromas of violet-laced fudge cake, ginger snaps, stewed black cherries, vanilla and sarsaparilla. The palate is all about purple flavors, with ginger-molasses spice as well as lifting spearmint and lilacs."
Brian Benson,G-S-M,93.0,55.0,1,"Rose petals, pomegranate, dried strawberry, a hint of tar and dried herbs combine for a complex nose on this bottling from the Lompoc-based winery. There is bright acidity on the palate, with cranberry, black pepper, coffee and cherry-pit flavors."
Brian Benson,Primitivo,89.0,40.0,1,"Cherry-berry crumble topped with vanilla cream gives this wine a brambly, succulent quality, dusted in light cinnamon spice, cedar and well-integrated tannin and oak. Powerful and full-bodied, it's fruity, balanced and enjoyable now."
Brian Benson,Red Blend,91.0,55.0,1,"Among Erath's dizzying array of single vineyard and other designated Pinot Noirs, it is almost impossible to single out the real players. This is a very appealing bottle, loaded with cherry fruit and lots of chocolaty oak. Forward, smooth and ready to go."
Brian Benson,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,55.0,1,"The name refers to the fact that the wine was both fermented and aged in stainless steel barrels. Made with Dijon clones from two different vineyards, it's fruit-driven, nicely flavored, offering melon, apple and white peach in equal proportion. It's a well-balanced wine, with clean, fresh flavors and just the right amount of acid to keep you reaching for the next glass."
Brian Benson,Syrah,92.5,50.0,2,"A lovely bottle, carefully crafted from vines approaching 40 years of age. A third of the wine was fermented in neutral barrels, softening the mouthfeel a bit, and kept on the lees for almost five months. Apples and pears, melon and grapefruit all seem to have been mixed in with wet stones; the wine makes a fresh and delicate impression with as much mineral and fruit. Stylish and lacy."
Brian Benson,Syrah-Mourvèdre,92.0,55.0,2,"Spicy and earthy, this medium-bodied red is rewarding in its layers of dried herb, sage and strawberry patch. The tartness lingers on the lean palate, ending in cranberry and cardamom."
Brian Carter Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.25,42.06,16,Touches of ginger and orange zest lighten up the ample fruit flavors of this well-balanced value-priced wine. It has good acidity to match the ripeness of the Anjou pear and white peach flavors.
Brian Carter Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.67,48.67,3,"This is an extremely ripe and viscous wine, almost too much to handle. The nose shows juicy blackberry syrup, crème de cassis, coconut and a hint of herbs, and then the palate delivers coffee, fudge, elderberry, black currant and pepper."
Brian Carter Cellars,Grenache,91.0,50.0,1,"Lemon-candy aromas are rounded with white peach, marshmallow and honeysuckle on the slightly sweet-leaning nose of this bottling. The sip is straightforward with lemon peel, slight marzipan, Gala apple and Bosc pear flavors."
Brian Carter Cellars,Merlot,88.0,55.0,1,"This wine oozes ripe lush flavors of boysenberry jam, milk chocolate and strawberry. It's very deep in color, has some tannins for added texture but is pretty smooth overall and seems to turn sweet on the finish."
Brian Carter Cellars,Port,94.0,20.0,1,"This 100% varietal wine's cocoa and sweet baking spice aromas are followed by ripe, luscious fruit and barrel flavors. Oak plays a prominent role, with light gamy notes that persist on the finish."
Brian Carter Cellars,Red Blend,89.2,32.56,25,"This 100% varietal wine leads with woodspice, green herb and flower aromas and follows with sweet, vanilla-laced black fruit flavors. Although aged entirely in used French oak, the barrel influence is prominent. The tannins bring dryness, needing food to ease their grit."
Brian Carter Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.4,34.0,5,"There's a hint of sweetness here, and light, almost watery fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry. This could accompany a starter course of mild cheeses."
Brian Carter Cellars,Rosé,88.0,25.0,1,"Pretty long in the bottle, this rich, soft, thick Zin offers a stewy taste of plums that veers sweet into molasses and jam. On the finish is an additional thickness of black pepper and leather."
Brian Carter Cellars,Touriga Nacional,89.0,50.0,1,"Like its companion Syrah from Cedar Ridge Vineyard fruit, this is pure varietal and spent 18 months in American oak. Earthy and somewhat bitter flavors of charred wood and espresso dominate the cassis fruit. The finish is chalky and tannic."
Brian Carter Cellars,Viognier,89.0,32.0,1,"Fuzzy stone fruit from apricot to peach dominate on the nose and palate in this straightforward, creamy and richer-styled wine. Batches of apple and lemon give it a crisp edge toward the middle before denser crème brûlée and vanilla take over on the finish."
Brian Carter Cellars,White Blend,89.3,23.7,10,"Dense and briary, with black and red plum notes complemented by a strong sense of clove, this wine is cushioned in tar, oak and cigar box, showing nicely resolved tannins. Blended with 16% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot, it is enjoyable now and will cellar well for many years to come."
Briceland,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,35.0,1,"This blend of 55% Grenache Blanc, 26% Viognier and 19% Roussanne smells like golden sunshine, with aromas of hot beach sand, lemon pound cake and vanilla pudding. The palate shows pan-fried green apples, red apple flesh and fortune cookie flavors. It makes a good alternative for lighter Chardonnay lovers."
Brick & Mortar,Chardonnay,91.33,45.67,6,"Suggestive of smoked duck, which would make a good pairing, this wine offers toasted oak around a core of raspberry-rhubarb compote, slightly complemented in herb. Velvety on the palate, it's well-composed, earthy and bright."
Brick & Mortar,Pinot Noir,90.75,38.5,4,"Dark, sappy and smoky, this engaging wine offers substantial cassis and blueberry fruit, dotted with highlights of caraway and dark chocolate. The tannins are beautifully polished, and the wine should have further improvement ahead as it ages through 2020."
Brick & Mortar,Pinot-Chardonnay,89.5,28.0,4,"There's a feral element to this vineyard-designate, the producer's only one from Napa Valley, from a vineyard planted originally in 1930. Extracted and thick, it offers plum, blackberry and raspberry around big, broad shoulders of mocha and oak. And as always, there's a hint of mint."
Brick House,Chardonnay,92.67,39.0,3,"Juicy, plummy and dusty, in well-integrated ways, this is a classically earthy old-vine Zin, with plush blueberry and blackberry on the palate that finishes rich in mocha and cinnamon. Medium in body and acidity, it's approachable and enjoyable now."
Brick House,Gamay Noir,90.0,29.0,1,"Leonetti's 2010 Reserve includes 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec—a more complex blend than the 2009. It opens with a lovely floral aroma—a bouquet of clover and white flowers—then heads for the dark side, with black cherry and cassis. It's a big, tannic wine, beautifully crafted, and clearly differentiated from the winery's regular Cabernet bottling."
Brick House,Pinot Noir,92.67,51.22,9,"This tastes like a more concentrated and sweeter version of Stottle's dry Viognier from the same vintage and vineyard. Deeply concentrated, complex and creamy, it's loaded with citrus and stone fruits, honey and butterscotch, yet remains lifted by defining acidity."
Bridge Press,Cabernet Franc,91.0,30.0,1,"Dense and extracted, this dark, loamy Pinot Noir is concentrated and challenging. The fruit is black, compact, and sheathed in flavors of loam. Layers are tight and a bit unyielding. There is depth and power here, but it must be extracted over time and with a bit of patience."
Bridgeview,Chardonnay,88.0,10.0,1,"Ignore its generic Oregon AVA—this is King Estate's top wine, a rich reserve-level Pinot Noir redolent with Asian spices, saffron, cumin and more. Nuances of dusty cocoa powder lead into a thrilling wine with a spine of steel, focusing its ripe, fleshy fruit through a long, cellar-worthy finish."
Bridgeview,Pinot Gris,86.0,14.0,2,"This exceptional wine was made by the late David Lett to celebrate the birth of his granddaughter. It's drinking beautifully, and has the color and scent of a mature wine, though Eyrie Pinots can often live longer than those who bet against them. Delicate and subtle, it nonetheless shows surpassing power and length. Mature, fully-evolved dried fruit and herb flavors are highlighted with notes of cinnamon and brown sugar."
Bridgeview,Pinot Noir,88.0,17.67,3,"This is McCrea's top cuvée, and the 2008 is as good as it has ever been. Co-fermented with 8% Viognier, it starts out tight and compact, with crisp marionberry fruit and a generous wash of coffee liqueur. The acids are citrusy and fresh, and the wine has depth and an emotional range that reaches almost symphonic power."
Bridgeview,Riesling,85.0,10.0,1,"Fenestra's proprietary blend of 59% Chardonnay and 41% Sémillon, this is a wine perfumed in gardenia that has a bite of oaky barrel amid barely ripe apple that finishes quick."
Bridgeview,Syrah,83.0,20.0,1,"This old-vine Zin has washed-out aromas and a savory, leathery character, tannic grip and a hit of smoke on the finish."
Bridlewood,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,50.0,1,"Muted aromas rise from the glass to reveal wild strawberry and floral rose notes in this wine. Crisp, underlying acidity and strong, present tannins support its ripeness and concentration, the body medium and the oak well-integrated."
Bridlewood,Chardonnay,88.0,35.0,1,"Aromas of candy corn, spice and almond butter are followed by full-bodied, tropical-fruit flavors that show a pleasing sense of richness and intensity. It's a delicious example of the variety, with a lingering finish."
Bridlewood,Pinot Noir,87.5,45.0,2,"A blend of Sangiovese (42%), Merlot (32%), and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is one of the first wines coming off the estate vineyard located next to the winery. A full five years old, it's starting to show a touch of age aromatically, with notes of bittersweet chocolate, dried cherry and dried herb along with sliced green pepper. The palate shows the brightness of acidity that this region of the valley is known for, heightening the fruit flavors and stretching out the finish."
Bridlewood,Red Blend,87.0,17.0,1,"One of the prettiest labels in Oregon adorns an equally lovely wine. It's aromatically lush with flowers, body powder and spice. The ripe berry fruit carries a dusting of cocoa powder. Drink 2018–2026."
Bridlewood,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,15.0,1,"Though this is one of the first wines from winemaker Jennifer Hoage's own label, it's a study of soft integration from what can be a powerful site. Cherry, allspice and rose aromas lead into a palate full of wild berry and hearty sagebrush notes, framed by pitch-perfect acidity. A light yet spicy licorice-inflected finish completes the experience."
Bridlewood,Syrah,91.0,40.0,1,"Another clean and tasty bottling from this label's numbered series, this shows light nectarine and lemon aromas on the nose. The texture is grippy and bright in acidity, offering crunchy Asian pear flavors that prove quite refreshing, with decent length."
Brigadoon,Pinot Noir,88.75,27.25,4,"Violet, sarsaparilla, crushed stone and dark berry aromas show on the nose of this bottling from Mourvèdre master Ryan Pease. Still quite young, it shows black plum, black fig, loamy earth and roast pork flavors and is bit richer and riper than his other bottlings."
Bright Angel WInes,Chardonnay,88.5,40.0,2,"This 100% varietal wine from the rocky, mountainous appellation offers sizable tannins and robust, smoky leather, black pepper and cola notes. Full-bodied and concentrated with ripe black fruit, it's a long, brawny experience."
Bright Angel Wines,Pinot Noir,88.0,50.0,2,"Gorgeous fruit aromas, generous and deep fruit flavors and soft, chocolate accents add up to a very flavorful but relaxed wine. Touches of clove and cedar pop up with the second sip, while some welcome tannins clean the palate. The fruit flavors come back on the finish. It is full-bodied but very smooth."
Brilliant Mistake,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,85.0,1,"This wine—the first vineyard-designate to come out of this young site—is 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Cabernet Franc and 22% Merlot. It takes time to get going but once it does, it provides generous aromas and flavors of coffee, vanilla, herbs, plum and cherry along with lightly grainy tannins. The precision and elegance the winery is known for is on full display."
Brimstone,Red Blend,87.0,17.0,2,"Finished off dry, this masks its residual sugar with ample acidity. Some portion of the winery's numerous individual Riesling lots is barrel fermented, and here there are unmistakable highlights of caramel. On the palate it's smooth and rich, with wide-open flavors of peach and pear."
Brittan Vineyards,Pinot Noir,93.0,53.0,6,"This classic site provides a grippy, structured experience of juicy, leathery blackberry and black pepper. The wine also reveals a brighter, more vibrant underside of red berry, perhaps from the contribution of 5% Grenache into the mix, alongside 17% Petite Sirah. Firm, focused and full bodied, this is a delicious wine."
Broadley,Pinot Noir,91.0,41.67,3,"This winery northeast of San Diego sources from up north and experiments heavily with stem inclusion on this bottling, which shows cherry blossoms, crushed cranberries and an earthy line of anise through the nose. Plush purple fruit flavors of olallieberry and boysenberry power the medium-bodied palate, with sage and peppercorn spice throughout."
Broadside,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.33,90.0,3,"A tiny-production wine that is exuberantly brambly and wild, this has a bouquet of juicy black and red berries at its core. Balanced and elegant despite the generous palate, it has softened tannins and a thickness toward the finish. offering accents of black pepper and brown sugar."
Broadside,Chardonnay,87.0,17.33,3,"There's a warm peach ripeness on the nose of this wine from a tiny appellation north of Santa Cruz near Bonny Doon, along with aromas of kumquat, vanilla bean and sea salt. The palate shows more peach, caramelized apples and saffron, cut with a lime-juice acidity and finishing with a dollop of vanilla-butter."
Broadside,Merlot,86.0,18.0,2,"Savory notes are at the fore on this wine, with aromas of saline, dried herbs, earth, stems and flowers. The coffee and earth flavors are sumptuous in feel with an extended finish."
Broadway Vineyards,Chardonnay,87.0,30.0,2,"Slate, raspberry and black plum aromas mark the nose of this blend of 39% Grenache, 38% Syrah, 13% Mourvèdre and 10% Petite Sirah. Pronounced gravel-like minerality leads the palate, which frames cranberry fruit with grippy tannins."
Broadway Vineyards,Merlot,84.0,40.0,1,"This is from a hillside estate vineyard and is entirely barrel fermented, its oak subtle and supportive. Medium bodied and not overripe, it offers honeysuckle aromas and lime and lemon rind flavors."
Broadway Vineyards,Syrah,86.0,35.0,2,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir and Syrah. Aromas of green wood mixed with tire rubber, red currant, strawberry and spice. It delivers red and black-fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
Brochelle Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,38.0,1,"Using Grenache sourced from the moderately cool Lonesome Springs Vineyard, this is slightly leafy, with notes of forest floor, blueberry and blackberry. This is the first pure Grenache ever made by Brian Carter. It doesn't just taste like a big bowl of berries; it has power and depth to spare."
Broken Earth,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,51.67,3,"Though quite different stylistically from the 2009, this is just as good. The structure in 2010 is noteworthy for its high acid focus. There are streaks of berry and cassis, with touches of smoke and espresso. This is a wine to cellar while you are drinking up the delicious 2009."
Broken Earth,Grenache,87.0,18.0,1,"It's rare that domestic Chardonnay is truly Chablis-like, but this delicately framed wine fits that description perfectly. Nuanced with mineral and spice notes, this has melon and apple flavors that seem to sail on a gentle sea breeze. It doesn't slam you with oak, instead it seduces with you style."
Broken Earth,Merlot,87.0,35.0,2,"Sourced from a small vineyard in the The Rocks of Walla Walla, this shows classic, terroir-driven umami flavors. It's as if the fruit were soaked in seaweed, then lifted on a platform of rock. It has lovely aromatics, with a rather delicate finish that's nuanced with cherry and tar."
Broken Earth,Petit Verdot,88.0,48.0,1,"This shows the textural depth of all the Efesté wines. A floral top note gives way to firm, dark, cassis and blackberry flavors. Light notes of herb, anise and earth are introduced and set comfortably into the lengthy finish. It has great power and flavor, with the possibility of cellaring for a decade or more."
Brooklyn Oenology,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,84.0,15.0,1,"Mostly Syrah, with some Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a succulent rosé with a marvelous mouthfeel. Texture and length are its main charms, with nuanced notes of rose petal, hibiscus, watermelon and pie cherry. The vineyard sources are Klipsun, Boushey and Ciel du Cheval."
Brooklyn West,Red Blend,86.0,24.0,1,"Still tight and chewy, this lushly-fruited Syrah mixes berry and cherry flavors with earthier, mineral-driven bass notes. It will require a bit more bottle age to unwind and decompress, but it has all of the ingredients of a wine with staying power."
Brooklyn West,Zinfandel,90.0,65.0,1,"This mixes blueberry, boysenberry and blackberry notes with a dressing of Bourbon and chocolate. Smooth and satiny, this is drinking exceptionally well at the moment."
Brooklyn Winery,Zinfandel,91.0,29.0,1,"A great vintage for the Sundance Red, this is 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 14% Syrah. The addition of Syrah really livens up the mix. It's a supple, sappy, sinuous red, with rich and complex cherry and berry fruits. The 30% new oak is not only lavish for a $20 wine, but it judiciously complements all of the good fruit."
Brooks,Gewürztraminer,88.0,18.0,1,"Using grapes sourced entirely from Boushey Vineyard, this well-structured Syrah has a claret-like refinement. Sleek and focused, it offers raspberry and black cherry flavors, with a tight, taut structure and length. Some notes of leaf and earth trickle onto the finish."
Brooks,Pinot Noir,89.0,39.7,10,"A cuvée of Riesling, with a tiny splash of Moscato, this is on the sweet side of brut. Scents of wet paper carry into disjointed flavors of waxy lemon and simple sugar."
Brooks,Riesling,91.5,24.17,6,"This wine of unknown grape varieties shows a thread of sweet cola and vanilla throughout a larger tunnel of smoky char, remaining somewhat flat, bitter and simple on the palate."
Brooks,Rosé,88.0,18.0,1,"This dull, tired wine is quickly moving past drinkability. Flat and lifeless, it hints at leather and little else."
Brooks,White Blend,90.0,18.0,1,"The aromas show notes of game, vanilla and grape Jolly Rancher, with the volatiles amped up. The flavors bring a mixture of sweet and tart, tussling through the finish."
Brophy Clark,Zinfandel,89.0,26.0,1,"This blend of 75% Pinot Grigio and 15% Vermentino is a light, simple quaff with some snap to it and not much on the finish."
Brotherhood,Chardonnay,84.0,12.0,1,"This weighty Vermentino has splashes of Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio. It tastes as though it spent a great amount of time in barrel, however the aging vessel is listed as 100% stainless steel."
Brotherhood,Riesling,81.0,11.0,1,"Generous floral and honeylike aromas lead to flavors of Fuji apples and Anjou pears with a rounded, fairly crisp texture. This wine is not typical for the varietal, but is tasty and enjoyable."
Brown Estate,Red Blend,91.0,40.0,1,"Grass, herb and passion-fruit aromas are followed by citrus and tropical flavors. It's pleasant but the concentration seems lacking."
Brown Estate,Zinfandel,90.0,55.0,1,"Extremely showy white tuberose flowers and tropical candied guava fruit combine into a bubblegum-like nose on this wine. The palate is overwhelmingly tropical, bordering on treacly in presentation."
Browne Family Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,31.5,2,"Fruit-bowl aromas, fresh but neutral flavors and a fairly soft texture make this light-bodied wine pleasant and easy to drink."
Browne Family Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,48.0,1,"Cherry aromas and flavors and a velvety texture make this light-bodied wine easy to drink. It has black peppery, woodsy notes in the tart cherry flavors and a sense of being aged and ready to drink."
Browne Family Vineyards,Chardonnay,87.0,22.0,1,"Bold and forward, this estate-grown Syrah fairly explodes with scents of game, cured meat and smoke. The black cherry and cassis fruit forms a dense and sappy core; as the wine skips across the tongue nuances of tobacco, sweet leather, chocolate and spices come into play. It just keeps on going, adding caramel and peppery chocolate through an evolving and satisfying finish."
Browne Family Vineyards,Grenache,88.0,18.0,1,"More powerful and potent than the '04, this simply has more juice, more depth, more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptional—dense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way. It already has the balance, the polish and the length to justify long-term cellaring. Tannins are ripe and supple, bringing in hints of dried herb and black olive."
Browne Family Vineyards,Red Blend,88.5,37.5,2,"This is a mix of 56% Sagemoor and 41% Champoux Cabernet, with a 3% splash of estate Petit Verdot. It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor. Woodward Canyon's red wines age beautifully, but if drunk young give them a lot of breathing time."
Browne Family Vineyards,Rosé,85.0,17.0,1,"Produced for Force Majeure by Syncline's James Mantone, this riveting wine is a blend of 47% Mourvèdre, 42% Syrah and 11% Grenache. Lush and redolent with wild berry and wet rock aromatics, it carries a thread of sweet grain along with bright, detailed berry fruit and balancing acidity. Delicious already, it can be enjoyed now through 2020."
Browne Family Vineyards,White Blend,86.0,34.0,1,"An attention-grabbing sense of umami introduces this wine, with darkly colored mushrooms, plum sauce, miso soup and black sage tickling the nose. There is dark chocolate with bits of espresso on the palate, which is leveled by plum skins and berry flesh, with bitter tar and black pepper on the finish."
Bruliam,Pinot Noir,90.23,38.08,13,"This is the most dynamic 2011 entry in Matthias Pippig's Loner series, starting with aromas of lemon juice, lime sorbet, wet chalk, white pepper and crushed herbs. The tight, mineral-driven flavors dance across diced peaches and baked apples, with lime spritzer and baking soda thrown on top."
Bruliam,Zinfandel,89.0,40.67,3,"A whirlwind of aromas—peppered black cherries, elderberry, caramel, toast, barrel smoke—rise off this appellation blend from German-born winemaker Matthias Pippig, who handcrafts small batches on Santa Barbara's Eastside. It's very soft on the palate, with medium-dark flavors of butter-crusted plum pie and an herbal note of pine pitch keeping it serious."
Bryn Mawr Vineyards,Chardonnay,90.0,30.0,1,"The sister wine to Ruby Leigh, this Cabernet-based blend is sourced principally from Red Mountain vineyards. It opens with scents of violets and moves into a firm palate mixing cassis, herb and iron shavings. Excellent structure cellaring through 2025."
Bryn Mawr Vineyards,Pinot Blanc,88.0,25.0,2,"This pure varietal wine showcases rich, ripe cherry pie fruit backed up against a mineral-soaked base. Baking spice highlights and a streak of caramel reflect aging in 100% new French oak. Acids and tannins are proportionate and substantial."
Bryn Mawr Vineyards,Pinot Noir,90.57,37.14,7,"Somewhat light in color, this is an aromatically appealing wine that shows a complex assortment of coffee, vanilla, pencil lead, cherry, blueberry and high-toned herbal notes. It's exquisitely polished in its styling, with plush tannins and a long, lingering finish. A pretty expression of the variety that shows a great degree of elegance and deftness, it drinks well out of the gate but continues to improve with additional time to breathe."
Bryn Mawr Vineyards,Riesling,89.0,25.0,1,"Elegant and attractive aromas of dark violet, red rose, cedar and a touch of vanilla serve as a promising entry point to this Cabernet. A bit of char kicks in on the palate alongside dark chocolate, espresso and ripe plum skin, with roasted beet in the background."
Bryter,Pinot Noir,87.0,68.0,1,"The best Still Waters release right now, this presents a sophisticated nose of cherry chutney, black pepper, blueberry and burning sagebrush. On the palate, blueberry fruit gets dashed with more black sage and tobacco, and the acidity and tannins are just right."
Bucher,Chardonnay,88.75,35.0,4,"This dry-farmed vineyard reliably delivers memorable wines, including this Syrah, redolent with notes of oregano, thyme, charred beef and tar. The herbs, fruit and smoke integrate smoothly on the palate, with boysenberry fruit in the background and crushed bouquet garni on the front."
Bucher,Pinot Noir,90.6,38.6,5,"Smoky in dark clove and black pepper, this is a smooth, bright Zinfandel from head-trained, dry-farmed vines planted in the 19th century. After skipping the 2011 vintage, the winery returns with this stunner, brambly in succulent blackberry with plenty of intriguing spice."
Buehler,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.6,41.4,5,"Pure Petit Verdot from Red Mountain's quintessential Bordeaux varietal vineyard—does it get any better? Big, deep and tannic, with lovely purity, this features ultraripe fig and plum fruit with a pleasing salinity. The finish is persistent and shows a streak of iron. Note the alcohol is pushing 16% however it is beautifully integrated."
Buena Vista,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,120.0,2,"From a seven-acre section of the vineyard, this offers plenty of saddle leather and cedar amidst spicy cardamom layers, a soft, juicy core and tingling acidity. The structure and weight suggest the ability to cellar comfortably through 2020."
Buena Vista,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.33,91.67,3,"A case study in cool-climate, estate-grown Syrah, the white pepper on the nose and palate is playful and exuberant, the acidity buoyant and lingering. The fruit takes on hushed tones of wild berry and bramble, with a soft texture inviting one in for more."
Buena Vista,Chardonnay,89.62,42.25,8,"The winery's proprietary block of Zin grapes (planted in 1999) from the coveted Stagecoach Vineyards contributes to an intense wine. Juicy and oaky, it's dense in cherry and plum, a note of lavender and sage complementing the whole. A thick liqueur sense characterizes the texture, but the palate stays alive through the site's rocky minerality. This one'll age."
Buena Vista,Colombard,88.0,32.0,1,"This vineyard-designate opens with intoxicating aromas of violet and rose before expanding on the palate into seamless, sturdy waves of juicy pomegranate and red cherry. Earthy and somewhat feral, it ends with a note of black tea."
Buena Vista,Petite Sirah,88.0,38.0,1,"Jammy aromas and concentrated grape and blackberry flavors pack a lot of fruitiness into this full-bodied and velvet-textured wine. The ripe and almost sweet berry and plum notes gush forth with gusto while the firm, grippy texture keeps the mouthfeel nicely dry and helps clear the palate for the next bite or sip."
Buena Vista,Pinot Gris,90.0,25.0,1,"Crushed bricks, rose petals, red currants and grape syrup are sprinkled with elegant black spices in this blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot by Steve and Chrystal Clifton. The palate is silky, redolent with mulberry and tart plums skins, amped up by sagebrush and thyme. It's perfect for a variety of foods."
Buena Vista,Pinot Noir,91.1,49.1,10,"This is just a gorgeous wine, so easy to enjoy, juicy in watermelon, grapefruit and dark, baked strawberry tart, a taste of summer evoked from every sip. Textured and complex, it gives a squeeze of blood orange that lingers and remains fresh through the finish. It's from the owner's estate vineyard, sought after by many other producers and made by Siduri's Adam Lee."
Buena Vista,Red Blend,87.6,41.0,5,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot. Intricate aromas of vanilla, cedar, powdered chocolate, pipe tobacco and black cherry lead to focused, layered fruit and barrel flavors that show persistence."
Buena Vista,Valdiguié,86.0,50.0,1,"Exhibiting cooler-climate characteristics, the fruit sourced primarily from the Stag's Leap District, this wine shows dried herb and cedar on the nose, evolving deeper layers of red cherry and cranberry on the midpalate. It takes on weight and structure on the finish."
Buena Vista,Zinfandel,86.0,38.29,7,"Floral and accented in papaya, this is a crisp, balanced and easy-to-love wine, from a vineyard farmed organically and biodynamically planted to three different clones. Fig, pear and vanilla all make an appearance amidst a medium-bodied texture and crisp, appealing finish."
Buffalo Ridge,Zinfandel,82.0,12.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon (70%) makes up the majority of this wine along with Merlot (23%), Malbec (5%) and Petit Verdot. It's aromatically brooding, with notes of black fruit, toffee, moist soil and a floral top note. The palate pulls few punches with its rich, high-octane flavors and firm tannins but manages to keep it all in balance."
Bully Hill,White Blend,84.0,7.0,1,"Earth and rocks power the nose of this wine by veteran Dan Lee, with chipped slate, cinnamon, bramble berries and smoked meat aromas. The palate blends black cherries with black rocks, black sage, licorice and herb-crusted beef roast flavors."
Bunchgrass,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,29.5,4,"This is beautifully aromatic and assertively tannic, with monster fruit that overtakes the 100% new oak and shows no hint of heat from the 15.5% alcohol. It's big, yet graceful, with veins of smoke and rock wrapped around the dense cassis and berry fruit. Young as it is, this has immense concentration and depth."
Bunchgrass,Bordeaux-style White Blend,90.0,24.0,1,"This is a GSM blend from a single vineyard, Lonesome Springs. Tobacco and vanilla scents merge into a midpalate with light red fruits. The acidity and smooth tannins keep it clean and tasty through the finish."
Bunchgrass,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,42.0,1,"A young, structured Pinot Noir exuding tart red cherry and pomegranate, clearly grown in a cool climate in a cool year with an undertone of brushy herbes de Provence. The finish continues the theme of tartness and acidity, a willing partner for something unexpected like oysters or bacon-wrapped dates."
Bunchgrass,Red Blend,92.0,30.0,1,"This insanely sippable wine is ready for spring oyster gatherings or gulping down on its own. Low in alcohol with just 6 g/L residual sugar, it's crisp, deliciously light and yet mouth-filling in tropical fruit and peach. Another masterful Chenin from Dry Creek Vineyard."
Bunnell,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,38.0,1,"Sweet but not too sweet for some entrées, such as spicy Thai food, this brings a fruity mix of pear, pineapple and orange-creamsickle flavors. It's smooth and soft, not at all sugary, and framed with fresh acids."
Bunnell,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.5,43.0,2,"Rich Cushman made this wine; it nicely expresses the minerality and tight fruit that characterizes this excellent vineyard. This is at first a rather austere, compact wine, but it is dense with layers of flavor and representative of one of the most unique terroirs in the Pacific Northwest."
Bunnell,Chardonnay,87.0,18.0,1,"A rich, concentrated Livermore Valley Bordeaux blend, comprised of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon and lesser percentages of Petit Verdot, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. This vintage of Supremacy has a big presence, smelling of earth and cinnamon, a layering of blackberry and chocolate lingering in the background. A wine with great texture and mellowing tannins ready to drink now or in 5–7 years."
Bunnell,Malbec,88.5,36.0,2,"This is a very summery bottling, with bright, fruity aromas recalling guava, peach, gardenia, pineapple and lemon-lime soda. That fruit salad aspect persists on the palate, but it's cut by a powerful burst of acidity, making it great for lakeside sipping."
Bunnell,Merlot,87.0,38.0,1,"One-quarter of this wine was fermented in neutral oak, the rest in stainless steel. At 12.5% alcohol, the light, almost airy wine brings immaculate fruit flavors of apple and pear, with a pleasing, minerally mouthfeel. It offers the faintest suggestion of caramel as it winds down."
Bunnell,Mourvèdre,89.0,37.0,2,"Soft yet perky strawberry aromas meet licorice, fennel bulb and cinnamon on the nose of this well balanced Zinfandel from a historic vineyard. There is a strong garrigue edge to the palate and a touch of roasted meat, giving depth to the bright and candied red fruit. Great with barbecue."
Bunnell,Pinot Gris,85.0,18.0,1,"Rhône variety-focused winemaker Larry Schaeffer ventures into Bordeaux territory with this bottling, which he recommends served with a slight chill. Smooth berry aromas meet grapeseed and crushed plum on the nose. The palate is light, fresh and easy to enjoy, with red fruit and dried herb flavors, proving easy to quaff."
Bunnell,Red Blend,89.0,34.5,4,"Opening aromas blend earthy red fruits with a whiff of leather. It's a nicely sculpted wine, tight and stiff, with pleasant berry and cherry flavors that stop abruptly as the finish turns a bit sour."
Bunnell,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,35.0,2,"Four clones, aged in 50% new French oak, constitute the heart and soul of this outstanding reserve. Redolent with a fertile mix of moist earth, compost, tobacco and floral highlights, it fills the mouth with a rich and seamless mix of plums, baked cherries and barrel notes. It leaves a tantalizing trail of mocha, toasted hazelnuts and caramel as it winds dreamily through a lingering finish."
Bunnell,Rhône-style White Blend,89.0,24.0,1,"Restrained in alcohol, this extreme Sonoma Coast Pinot delivers plenty of flavor, along the lines of funky, earthy licorice and whole-cluster cardamom spice, supported along the way by a pomegranate note. Zingy acidity is present, along with a low imprint of oak."
Bunnell,Sangiovese,87.0,24.0,1,"Minute quantities of these rare Viogniers are produced, which is a shame, because they are distinctive and enlightening. Deep gold and intensely aromatic with brilliant floral notes, this is a beautifully balanced wine, with the acidity and skin flavors to put a crisp frame around the ripe peach and apricot fruit."
Bunnell,Syrah,89.5,42.0,6,"Ripe raspberry jam scents gain intrigue thanks to hints of eucalyptus oil, orange rinds and iron on this Jim Clendenen-made wine. The palate is driven by dried herbs, from oregano to thyme, with cooked pork rind meatiness in the middle and a vanilla-flecked finish."
Bunnell,Viognier,89.0,18.0,1,"This esteemed winery's younger Chardonnays are all about tension and the future. This begins with slightly sour aromas of yogurt and goat cheese along with shave fennel, radish, daikon and lemongrass. The palate is power by citrusy pith, brine and nectarine peels, with just the tiniest touch of green apple ripeness. Drink 2018–2024."
Bunnell,White Blend,89.0,24.0,1,"A study of umami, this wine shows shiitake mushrooms, decomposing wood, soy and hibiscus on the nose. The palate is silky smooth yet with immediate verve, unfolding with flavors of loam, beef char, teriyaki-laced berries, smashed plums and graphite. It's focused yet expansive."
Burbank Ranch,Arneis,88.0,29.0,1,"A special bottling made by the producer to honor her late son, this wine is dark and brooding, offering a depth and warmth of baked plum and blackberry seasoned in cardamom, with a satisfying finish of coffee. With sizable tannin and oak, it suggests cellaring through 2022–2025 to enjoy further its complexity and concentration."
Burbank Ranch,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,52.0,1,"From a warm vineyard site in a cool year, this Cab intrigues in sage and chewy black cherry, possessed of a powerful, buoyant minerality. Dark chocolate, tobacco and black tea frame the generous ripeness and velvety nature of the wine, which can withstand time in the cellar to commingle more, through 2021."
Burbank Ranch,Malbec,91.0,46.0,2,"Deep, dense black cherry signals immediately that this is pure, classic Dundee Hills fruit, much of it from Abbey Ridge. Average vine age is 30 years—giving it great penetration and complexity. At first tight and unyielding, it opens with scents of coffee and chocolate, and displays the thick minerality of all the winery's 2012s. Nuanced herbs add a peppery kick to the finish."
Burbank Ranch,Mourvèdre,87.0,39.0,1,"Juicy in cassis and black cherry before taking on beguiling layers of peppercorn, chicory, tobacco and black tea, this Cab has a lot going on from the get-go, and yet there's no doubt about its ability to take on further nuance and complexity with time. Bittersweet chocolate accents the finish. Enjoy through 2027–2030."
Burbank Ranch,Rosé,87.0,24.0,1,"Gavin Chanin's take on this vineyard shows lots of dark but never heavy spice on the nose, with bergamot, white sage and damp eucalyptus forest complementing the raspberry fruit. The palate clings to a line of graphite minerality, with cooked raspberry torte and loamy earth flavors leading into a black-tea finish."
Burgess,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,48.0,2,"Winemaker Sabrine Rodems lays on exciting aromas of light pomegranate juice decorated by toasted sagebrush, charred fennel, pan-toasted peppercorns, graphite and pine ash. The herb-driven, very fragrant chaparral-like flavors show pine needles, rosemary, chemise and bay leaf against a cranberry juice background."
Burgess,Syrah,90.0,36.0,1,"Fragrant, smoky, oaky and seductive, this toasty wine is immediately appealing, and has been given the all-star treatment. The young vineyard offers promising fruit; its flavors light and clean, tasting of raspberries and pie cherries. Lots of oak gives it a very chocolaty finish."
Buried Cane,Chardonnay,87.0,14.0,1,"Young and fresh, this 100% Malbec has tight, spicy, peppery fruit that leads into a surprisingly long finish. It's not tricked up with oak, but the sharp young berry flavors evolve in the mouth and bring on clove, wintergreen and mint, which resonate through a lingering finish. Though the fruit lacks flesh, it doesn't hold back on pure flavor, and promises good things ahead for this new vineyard."
Buried Cane,Red Blend,90.0,25.0,1,"This six-year-old blend of 46% Syrah, 32% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Merlot is showing its age, with aromas of reduced cherry sauce, tar and cocoa dust. The rustic palate is full of leather, tobacco, dried cherries and dusty earth flavors. Still interesting, but drink up soon."
Buried Cane,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,25.0,1,"This crisp tightly woven white is showy in fresh-cut grass and gooseberry flavors, with an underlying grasp of grapefruit and lemon. The texture is gritty."
Burnt Bridge,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.67,37.33,3,"This is a rounded mouth-filling wine that takes mild watermelon aromas and adds subtle white peach and pear flavors. It's quite rich in texture, low in acidity and alcohol, and has a lingering finish."
Burnt Bridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.5,37.0,2,"Tart, firm and simple, this wine lacks complexity and structure somewhat, providing quiet flavors of leather saddle and cedar amongst a soft rounded tannin profile."
Burnt Bridge,Grenache,83.0,30.0,1,"Nutty, woody and tannic, this is a broadly etched wine. It is ripe and extracted, with simple layers of black cherry, cinnamon and cola."
Burnt Bridge,Merlot,90.0,32.0,1,"This blend of Merlot and Tempranillo, with touches of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon, opens with notes of warm cherry pie, black tobacco and cedar. Fresh boysenberry starts the palate, with mouthwatering spice in the midpalate and mocha on the finish."
Burnt Bridge,Red Blend,89.5,27.5,2,"A Syrah-esque bit of smoke and cured meat wafts from this wine aromatically, which follows through on the palate. Bright cherry and currant fruit then intermix with a restrained sense of clove spice, the Stagecoach Cab blended with Malbec and Petit Verdot, aged in 60% new French oak."
Burnt Bridge,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,35.0,1,"This bold, dry, firmly tannic wine will taste good now with rich foods, but could easily improve with aging through 2017. It is deeply colored, full bodied and a bit sandy in texture, yet that grip seems O.K. in this wine, balanced by the ripe fruit flavors."
Burnt Bridge,Rhône-style White Blend,87.0,25.0,1,"This well-balanced red made from a variety used in Port wines grows on you with each sip. It has bright cherry and raspberry aromas, exotic floral flavors, good acidity, a smooth texture and medium body. It should be versatile with food."
Burnt Bridge,Syrah,89.75,34.5,4,"Ripe strawberry pie and cigar box aromas frame the nose on this top-end offering from Broken Earth. It's surprisingly light on the palate, with cherry pie and cranberry tartness leading the way alongside bright acidity and dainty tannins."
Burnt Bridge,Viognier,91.0,25.0,2,"This wine is electric pink in color, with notes of strawberry bubblegum and cranberry. It drinks off dry, with watermelon and red fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
Burrell School Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,65.0,1,"This 90% Syrah and 10% Grenache blend, named as an ode to the winemaker's butcher-ancestors, begins with scents of blueberry crème brûlée with a spearmint glaze. The flavors are comparably light, with tarter blueberry, some licorice on the midpalate and a tannic finish."
Burrell School Vineyards,Cabernet Franc-Merlot,86.0,39.0,1,"The pretty but powerful nose is like striking a gusher of black gold in a field of lavender, full of tar, violet and blueberry. Leather and deep purple fruit lead the palate, with charred meat savoriness, black pepper spice and plum skin tannins making a good case for this seven-acre vineyard that was planted in 1998."
Burrell School Vineyards,Chardonnay,89.5,31.0,2,"A blend of 57% Merlot, 37% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Syrah, this opens with a sweetly spiced bouquet of red and purple fruits. The medium weight midpalate brings tart plum and cherry flavors, plentiful acidity and moderate, balanced tannins. Drink now through 2020."
Burrell School Vineyards,Merlot,89.0,32.0,1,"The private project of veteran winemaker Robert Brittan, the limited-production wines under his own label are treasures. This is his inaugural release. Both fruit ripeness and meaty depth are here in abundance, with a complex mix of tree fruits and stone fruits, streaks of earth and a fine layering of chocolate. This is a wine you excavate as much as drink; it's full of surprises."
Burrell School Vineyards,Pinot Noir,91.0,39.0,1,"Reduced in a weight of oak and tight tannins, this wine takes time to come around and develop any juiciness to the palate, offering a mix of red cherry and cranberry laced in forest and spice. It finishes quick and lean."
Burrell School Vineyards,Syrah,85.0,30.0,1,"Baked bread and brown sugar make this a comforting wine in some sense. Similarly, the fruit follows a baked quality that makes it taste bigger than it is. Meanwhile, herbal leanings betray the wine's low level of alcohol."
Buttonwood,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,22.0,2,"This wine, aged in stainless steel barrels, offers muted berry fruit, somewhat masked by aromas of rubber tire and plastic. The finish is short and slightly bitter."
Buttonwood,Bordeaux-style White Blend,92.0,24.0,1,"A rare grape in Oregon, this is a bright garnet shade and scented with cranberry and raspberry fruit. Acidity brings significant snap to the flavors, so much so that for many tasters it will show best with some greasy/smoky grilled meats. A hint of Band-Aid comes up in the finish, but does not distract."
Buttonwood,Cabernet Franc,92.0,26.0,1,"Given time to ferment and age in a majority of neutral oak, this wine still offers thickness and viscosity. It's rich and lush in tropical pineapple, mango and sliced peach, buoyed by acidity and a focused approach."
Buttonwood,Chardonnay,89.0,32.0,1,"This one-barrel bottling is quite intriguing, offering unexpected aromas and flavors. An element of crunched grapeseeds and unfermented wine grapes mixes with licorice, olive and pepper on the nose. A similar sense pervades the palate, along with light coffee and brown tea flavors. It's slightly odd, but also an interesting change of pace."
Buttonwood,Grenache Blanc,89.0,22.0,1,"A light, refreshing version of the variety from the heart of the Russian River, this traffics in medium-bodied peach and lime, ending with a sweetness of acidity."
Buttonwood,Rosé,89.0,18.0,2,"One of the more reliable, affordably priced Rhône blends in the state, this mix of 43% Grenache, 34% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 8% Counoise offers slightly shy aromas of black and red licorice, red currant and cinnamon candy, tucked behind a layer of slate. The palate is more simplistic, with purple fruits most prevalent."
Buttonwood,Sauvignon Blanc,88.4,17.6,5,"Lemon custard, ripe Gala apples and a seemingly sweet candy element show on the nose of this wine from a family-owned producer. Bright energy and ripe apple characterize the palate, along with green pear skins and stonefruit."
Buttonwood,Syrah,89.0,18.0,1,"Strawberry fruit is mixed in with fresh, pungent herbs—a mix that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains terroir. Fruity, full and forward, this ripe and pleasing wine is balanced just right for near-term enjoyment."
Buttonwood Farm,Syrah,90.0,20.0,1,"A blend of fruit from three different sites, united by their green farming practices, this is clean, fruity and forward. A mouth-pleasing Pinot with generously juicy and pretty cherry flavors."
Buttonwood Grove,Chardonnay,83.0,16.0,1,"This southern Rhone-style blend consists of 35% Mourvèdre, 40% Grenache and 25% Syrah. Steely minerality underscores pretty cherry fruit, with a light and peppery streak of herb running through the tannins."
Buty,Bordeaux-style White Blend,88.5,25.0,2,"The winery's most-available Syrah is co-fermented with a splash of Viognier. The fruit is tight and compact, clean with red and black berry flavors, framed by firm, polished tannins."
Buty,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,92.0,55.0,1,"Aged entirely in stainless steel tanks, this carries a light touch (7 g/L) of residual sugar but remains sharp, even edgy, with bright acidity and pine needle highlights. Ripe apple and pineapple flavors carry through the clean and refreshing finish."
Buty,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,94.0,48.8,5,"Fermented in neutral oak barrels, this tasty wine is loaded with pretty raspberry and cherry fruit. It's fresh and vibrant, with excellent concentration and length."
Buty,Chardonnay,90.8,38.8,5,"A whiff of pine needle runs through this wine, accenting its tight and trim red berry fruit. It's a mix of three clones that were aged in one quarter new French oak, which brings notes of vanilla and toast to its smooth finish."
Buty,Merlot-Cabernet Franc,90.25,45.0,4,"Delicate in aromas of honeysuckle, Asian pear, Gravenstein apple and a smoky butter element, this shows that quality Chardonnay can indeed succeed in this warmer region of Southern California. The wine is also soft and restrained on the sip, with fresh nectarine and white-flower flavors, finishing with a familiar kiss of oak."
Buty,Red Blend,91.3,52.5,10,"This blend of 60% Gamay, 28% Cabernet Franc and 12% Pinot Noir, sourced from widely separate vineyards throughout Oregon, is a surprising success. The flavors are ripe, recalling sweet mulberry and blackberry, and the polished tannins wrap it up nicely. Drink up."
Buty,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,48.0,2,"This well known vineyard captures the light, elegant and downright pretty nature of the Pinot Noir grape. Plum, raspberry and Bing cherry flavors combine, with fresh acidity adding some citrus highlights."
Buty,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,95.0,25.0,1,"Extremely dense blackberry, black peppercorns, asphalt, grape candy and violets show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard on a hillside north of the Santa Maria Valley. The palate packs in-your-face tannins and density, with flavors of black cherry, blueberry and blackberry. Give it time, then serve with the heartiest fare."
Buty,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,60.0,1,"Vanilla, baking spice, cranberry and cherry aromas lead to soft, medium-bodied fruit flavors with an elegant styling. It's a very pretty representation of the vintage with good balance."
Buty,White Blend,91.0,23.6,5,"Ripe in style, this offers aromas of blueberry pie and spice that lead to rich, full-bodied blue- and black-fruit flavors. There's quite a bit of warmth but the wine's appeal is hard to ignore."
Byington,Cabernet Franc,91.0,36.0,1,"There's plenty of nuance and detail on this concrete-aged wine, with its baked apple and spice aromas and flavors. It shows a fine sense of elegance and balance."
Byington,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,33.0,1,"An exuberant boysenberry jam aroma and richly layered berry and dark chocolate flavors give lots of taste pleasure to this full-bodied and impressively textured wine. It's a monster in terms of tannin and impact on the taste buds, but not over the top in alcohol. Best to drink from 2018 to 2025."
Byington,Chardonnay,86.0,33.33,3,"Well balanced, lively and delicious, this medium-bodied wine pulls together spicy oak and raspberry aromas, compelling and bright fruit flavors and a lip-smacking texture due to fine-grained tannins and good acidity."
Byington,Grenache,91.0,38.0,1,"Condensed blackberries, cassis and a kirsch-like heat hit the nose on this blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Syrah and 10% Petite Sirah. More blackberry fruits meet with smoked beef and concentrated violets on the palate."
Byington,Merlot,92.0,35.0,1,"Made to pair with halibut on the winemaker's annual trip to Alaska, this blend of 68% Viognier, 16% Marsanne and 16% Grenache Blanc shows beeswax, seared pears, caramel corn, apple syrup and peach crème brûlée on the nose. It's light and playful on the palate, with ripe lemons, rounded stone fruit, honeysuckle and citrus zest."
Byington,Petite Sirah,88.0,36.0,2,"Meaty, spicy accents enliven this full-bodied and ripe-tasting wine, adding a layer of interest and depth. The aromas and flavors show blackberries and black pepper, while the texture is smooth and a sense of richness on the lingering the finish."
Byington,Pinot Noir,87.67,40.0,6,"Green herb, barrel spice, clove and cherry aromas intermingle and lead to a highly structured palate, with supple fruit flavors. It might be a touch green for some tastes."
Byington,Sauvignon Blanc,85.33,25.0,3,"Tropical vanilla and pineapple notes provide this full-bodied wine with voluptuous fruit and texture. That ripeness finds its equilibrium on the midpalate, settling down into lemon peel and quince highlights that finish bright."
Byron,Chardonnay,92.33,37.33,3,"This Merlot-dominated wine includes 28% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. Its personality has bright and brooding sides, edged with subtle sage perfume, juicy dark cherry flavors and sizable oak."
Byron,Pinot Noir,93.12,50.12,8,"A distinctive smoky, peppery aroma and equally interesting savory flavors complement plenty of ripe fruit in this full-bodied, dry and balanced wine. Co-fermented with Petite Sirah and Barbera, it shows plenty of fine-grained tannins, giving good grip to the palate and more than just fruitiness. Best after 2020."
C R Graybehl,Grenache,88.0,34.0,2,"Forest, cola and grilled mushroom flavors punctuate the experience of this light-bodied wine that's subdued in structure and soft on the palate. Blueberry and white pepper notes close out the finish."
C R Graybehl,Grenache Blanc,88.0,24.0,2,"This blend of 50% Mourvèdre, 25% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 5% Counoise shows blackberry, rose petal, hibiscus and Dr. Pepper spice touches on the nose. There's decent structure to the palate, where blueberry notes meet tarry elements and a touch of charred meat."
C R Graybehl,Rosé,90.0,22.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (57%), Merlot (25%), Cabernet Franc (14%) and Petit Verdot all coming from Quintessence Vineyard. Aromas of black tea, smoke, cassis and barrel spice are followed by saturated black-fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of grip and the midpalate dips a touch, but overall the wine delivers a lot of enjoyment."
C'est Bon,Chardonnay,88.0,35.0,1,"From a lovely site in the Sebastopol Hills, this wine is tart and tangy with pomegranate and dark cherry flavors, deepened with spicy earth and cardamom accents. It offers length, breadth and a full-bodied expression of the grape and place."
C. Beck,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,48.0,1,"Temecula veteran winemaker Phil Baily has cracked the code on making fresh whites in the region's hotter climes, and this blend of 64% Sauvignon Blanc and 36% Sémillon is a stellar example. Honeysuckle, candied lemon peel, fragrant chamomile and tart pear and apple scents show on the nose while the palate packs tangy honeydew, peach and citrus zest flavors. Bright acidity carries them into the finish."
C.G. di Arie,Petite Sirah,88.0,30.0,1,"The nose of this bottling remains tight long after opening, which suggests a decent cellar potential. A hearty swirl coaxes out thyme, bay leaf, graphite and elderberry aromas before the palate delivers salt and pepper spice and dark blackberry fruit, wrapped in solid tannins."
C.G. di Arie,Zinfandel,85.0,35.0,1,"Canoe Ridge Vineyard is the warmer of the winery's two single-vineyard Chardonnay sites. Straw, spice and stone-fruit aromas lead to a full-bodied palate, loaded with ripe peach and tropical-fruit flavors. It provides lots of appeal, along with exquisite balance."
CC Pachyderm,Pinot Noir,90.0,70.0,1,"Despite coming from the warmest vintage on record for the state, this wine displays a very pleasing sense of restraint. Aromas of straw, clarified butter and peach are followed by well-balanced, textured fruit flavors. An elegant styling only heightens the appeal."
CK Mondavi,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,7.0,1,"A nice debut from this new label under the Tendril umbrella. Intense in color and deep in flavor, this pure varietal rosé pushes forward raspberry and cherry fruit with plenty of juicy pizzazz. The back end revs up with a burst of citrus rind."
CK Mondavi,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,7.0,1,"Though found in some Chardonnays, there's a heaviness to this wine, with its orange Muscat nose and syrupy flavors, that seems out of sync here. The wine seems to flop onto the palate and sit there, without much progression. Needs more acid and a lighter touch."
CK Mondavi,Pinot Grigio,86.0,7.0,2,"This is a muscular Merlot, exotic in cinnamon/cardamom spice that's otherwise soft, structured and complex. The tannins are most pronounced on the finish and need time to further integrate, but make the wine long-lasting in leathery cassis and tobacco flavor."
CK Mondavi,Sauvignon Blanc,85.0,7.0,1,"The excellent Olsen vineyards provided the fruit for this pure Malbec. It's still quite young, showing clean and tightly-wound flavors. Berry and cherry fruit highlights the palate, with a light hint of chocolate woven through the finish."
CK Mondavi,Zinfandel,80.0,8.0,1,"A quirky blend of six wildly-different white grapes, this has some sweet fruit, some bitter phenolics, and a noticeable honeyed character, suggesting that there was some botrytis in the mix. Rich and loaded with flavors of lemon curd, apricot and ripe peaches, it's a creative, interesting wine, worth exploring at this price."
CUTT,Red Blend,89.33,44.0,3,"One of the few varietal bottlings produced in the state, this concrete-fermented wine brings notes of straw, wet stone, herbs and citrus zest. It's tart and mouthwatering with lemony acidity and a textured feel, screaming out for shellfish to be served alongside it."
Ca' Del Grevino,Dolcetto,91.0,100.0,1,"Sourced entirely from the Artz vineyard, this Sauvignon Blanc is quite fruity, concentrated, slightly sweet, and drinking optimally. Flavors of melon and citrus carry on through a lush, well-rounded finish."
Ca' Del Grevino,Pinot Noir,91.0,125.0,1,"This Bordeaux-style blend is a mix of Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot, tart and falling on the thin side. Wild raspberry fruit is accented with scents and flavors of earth and hay. It's aromatic, astringent, and well-suited for grilled meats."
Ca' Del Grevino,Riesling,91.0,60.0,1,"This cool-climate Riesling, technically off-dry with 2% residual sugar, has very tart, highly extracted flavors, with flavors including tangy citrus, peach, apricot and papaya. The length, acidity, texture, mouthfeel, depth and surpassing freshness are exceptional."
Ca' Del Grevino,Syrah,89.0,80.0,1,"Here's a light, spicy, pretty red wine, mixing juicy and sweet plum and purple grape flavors with plenty of acid. You might pick up hints of tobacco, a little white pepper; the acids keep the wine fresh and the fruit is youthful and vibrant."
Ca' Momi,Chardonnay,87.0,45.0,1,"Surely there is no other Syrah-Tempranillo-Merlot-Dolcetto-Graciano-Petit Verdot-Nebbiolo-Cabernet Franc-Grenache-Muscat-Viognier-Tannat-Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon in the world? What's it taste like? Well, red table wine is as good a description as can be offered. Racy red fruits, mineral, bitter chocolate, good grip, spicy tannins—bring on the burgers."
Ca' Momi,Merlot,90.0,44.0,1,"The Macari No 1 offers an aromatic nose of grapefruit and tropical fruit, followed by crisp citrus and mineral flavors. The wine is balanced and refreshing, but has complexity. Pair with Thai or Indian dishes."
Ca' Momi,Pinot Noir,87.0,50.0,1,"This funky white blend, now in its 6th rendition, carries no vintage or regional designation, but we know it's a blend of several white grapes grown mostly in Oregon. The nose is ripe and full of melon, while the spunky palate deals orange and lemon, but not in sour-ball fashion. The finish has some thickness and a slight sticky feel, but ample acidity throughout renders it a good, brisk drink."
Ca' Momi,Red Blend,88.0,15.0,1,"While this wine is labeled ""dry,"" it's technically not. There's some sugar left in it, it just seems dry if you compare it to the winery's regular, semi-dry version. Aromas of spiced pears and musky, evening flowers blend with flavors of pears, peaches and dried spices."
Ca' Momi,Sparkling Blend,86.5,15.0,2,"This offers bright raspberry jam, herb, pepper and spice aromas. It's full of vanilla flavors, seeming somewhat disjointed."
Ca' Momi,White Blend,88.0,15.0,1,"This spritzy, 100% Viognier wine delivers melon, citrus zest and floral flavors. It drinks dry, fresh, clean and tart—an unusual interpretation of the variety."
Cabot Vineyards,Red Blend,88.0,25.0,1,"This wine's perfumed melon, white flower, vanilla and baking spice scents are followed by broad stone fruit flavors that finish tart. It goes down easy."
Cadaretta,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.33,58.33,3,"This 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon shows cocoa, green herb and cherry notes, with a hint of volatility. It's medium bodied on the palate, with scratchy tannins."
Cadaretta,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,46.67,3,"This wine's smoke, seaweed, black pepper, orange peel and purple fruit aromas pop. The palate features easy-drinking fruit flavors, with gritty tannins to back them up."
Cadaretta,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.62,46.62,8,The deep-copper color and complex fruit aromas of this wine seem well matched with a rather broad texture and medium-full body. The raspberry flavors have a meaty savory accent.
Cadaretta,Sangiovese,88.0,50.0,1,"This smells of burnt match and soap, with flavors of very tart citrus and hints of pear and orange. There's plenty of acid but not much weight to the mid-palate."
Cadaretta,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,89.0,22.83,6,"The entrance of violets and black cherry is offset by volatility and lingering scents and flavors of nail polish through the wine's mid-palate. It finishes with earthy, rough tannins"
Cadaretta,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,23.0,1,"Both a study of clone and stainless-steel processing, this wine offers fresh-cut pineapple, ripe Gala apple, honeydew and even peach, with a citrus-skin sharpness to the nose. The flavors are delicate and familiar but complex and deep, with Anjou pears, lemon-lime soda and apple flesh. It's a lively stainless expression."
Cadence,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.58,46.16,31,"This wine, made by Native American descendent Tara Gomez from the Chumash tribe, is dynamic on the nose. It shows both ripeness and minerality, with aromas of crystallized white peach, dewy herbs, green apples and a hint of guava. It's tight, steely and chalky once sipped, opening toward ripe pome fruit and cut grass, ever-evolving in the glass without going overripe."
Cadence,Red Blend,91.0,48.0,5,"This blend of Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Petite Sirah offers suave aromas of cherry, vanilla and white chocolate. The palate is dense with fudge flavors as well as black-cherry sauce, dark chocolate, slight bits of chopped mint and decent acidity to clean it all up."
Cairdean Estate,Cabernet Franc,85.0,84.0,1,"This full-bodied but far from heavy wine has wonderful aromatic complexity, evoking Bing cherries, black tea, clove and pine forest, while the flavors gush with red cherry and rhubarb. The slightly lean and crisp balance combines with bright and layered flavors in an appealing way. Best through 2020."
Cairdean Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,98.0,1,"Dense and intense, with loads of fine-grained tannin, this is a deep, dark-colored wine with oodles of flavor and a very thick texture. As massive as it is in texture though, delicious flavors like blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate come through and then linger on the finish. Drink from 2016 to 2026."
Cairdean Estate,White Blend,86.0,38.0,1,"This big-boy, 100% varietal Cab is reflective of both its vintage and provenance, a celebration of black pepper, blackberry and tar around an intensely full-bodied, bittersweet palate. Tobacco leaf and leather saddle interweave themselves through the wine's middle and end. Drink now through 2020."
Cairdean Estate,Zinfandel,90.0,58.0,1,"This is a rich, inviting wine with characteristics of dried cranberry and red currant, replete with dusty, spicy tannins and spicy, spiked vanilla. Lush, the tannins are soft and supple, a tad smoky, and the secondary elements darker in smoke, black licorice and espresso. Burly, it's balanced and refined."
Cairdeas,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,34.0,2,"An excellent medium-bodied wine from an estate better known for its olives, this is dark in color but with a lighter, tawny rim. The complex aromas combine sweet baking spices with ample cherry and berry notes. Flavors kick in with juicy strawberry, dark cherry and subtle shadings of nutmeg and wood smoke. The texture is plush and almost soft, and the taste is warmly luxurious."
Cairdeas,Red Blend,87.0,34.33,3,"This 100% varietal wine makes the case for Viognier in this appellation, expressing Golden Delicious apple and pear around a fresh, medium build of viscous texture, lemon and wild honey. Pretty and aromatic, it's a classically fine-formed white, made in small quantities."
Cairdeas,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.67,40.0,3,"The last vintage that the Melvilles are pulling from this Los Alamos Valley vineyard, this wine shows a complex nose of lemon candy, dill and fresh oregano. There is plenty of tension and grip on the palate, thanks to the lime-pith flavors, but a show of white flowers like tuberose keeps it properly ripe."
Cairdeas,Rhône-style White Blend,87.33,23.0,3,"This is proving to be a great vintage for this emerging producer in an increasingly exciting region of mid-Monterey County. Graphite, crushed rocks, rose petals and cranberry show on the nose, followed by a palate of black peppercorns, eucalyptus, snappy black raspberry and lots of black clove."
Cairdeas,Syrah-Petite Sirah,84.0,38.0,1,"Extremely intriguing on the nose, this shows aromas of Meyer lemon, green banana and tangerines. Generous yellow fruits like melon and Gala apples show on the palate, which is soft with lemon-bar elements at first but then tightens around green apple skins and a peppery, herbal character."
Cakebread,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,115.0,1,"The wine is King Estate's superpremium offering, made exclusively with organically grown grapes from the estate vineyard. Lush and earthy, it's got a lot of forward, tart berry fruit power, turns a bit soft in the middle, and sails away with a hint of heat and a lick of chocolate."
Cakebread,Chardonnay,91.0,56.0,1,"Nicely balanced and fairly fruity, this wine is easy to like for its crisp apple and grapefruit aromas, fresh and ripe flavors and smooth and lively texture."
Calavera,Albariño,89.0,18.0,1,"Very fruity in flavor and tangy in mouthfeel, this full-bodied wine combines lively acidity with citrus, herb and ripe pear flavors and a touch of sweetness. Little or no oak influence comes through, so the vivid fruit components take center stage."
Calavera,Grenache,88.0,28.0,1,"Grassy, floral and herbal, this nice white comes from a well-regarded site devoted to the variety. Melon and fuzzy peach flavors highlight its dry, diluted palate, with moderate acidity."
Calavera Wines,Albariño,82.0,18.0,1,"This new offering combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot from the mountain site. The wine is intensely ripe and tart, with rounded edges and an oaky underbelly. Cedar and black currant are the dominant characteristics."
Calavera Wines,Grenache,90.5,28.0,2,"This Merlot-driven blend also includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, the grapes grown on upper bench blocks of the producer's estate. It's simple, offering red cherry, currant and cedar flavors, with firm, persistent tannins and a ripe, round mouthfeel."
Calcareous,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,59.0,1,"This has a noticeable scent of tackroom leather that carries into the flavors, somewhat muting the black-cherry fruit. For such a young wine it is already on the way to drying out. Some interesting accents of pipe tobacco, smoke and coffee run through the finish. It's now at its best, so drink up."
Calcareous,Red Blend,89.0,48.0,1,"A small portion of this wine (10%) is barrel fermented, which seems to slightly soften and round out the feel. Fleshy pear and apple comes with a hint of honey on the palate."
Calcareous,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.33,50.33,3,"The family-owned, Santa Lucia Highlands-focused Wrath Winery produces their Ex Anima line to show off wines from their estate San Saba Vineyard made with very little intervention and no new oak. This wine is nearly as clear as water, and yet offers aromas or freshly cut grass, honeydew melon, kiwi and fresh rain on rocks. On the palate, minerality lingers alongside poached pear and peach. Refreshing and light, yet full of flavor."
Calcareous,Syrah,92.5,47.0,2,"Aged in 100% new French oak, this dark and muscular wine has lush scents of cut tobacco and dense cassis fruit. Black olive highlights bring a nice herbal element to the mix. The tannins, though quite astringent, are ripe and balanced."
Calcareous,Syrah-Petit Verdot,94.0,49.0,1,"Vanilla-soaked French toast and caramelized apples promise a butter bomb in this Testarossa take on the historic Sierra Madre Vineyard in the Santa Maria Valley. Once sipped, there is a surprising level of soda-like acidity, and a steadily emerging flavor profile that ranges from cream soda to squeezed lime."
Caldera,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,79.0,1,"Sourced entirely from the Chelle den Millie vineyard, the grapes were picked and processed specifically for rosé. A deep, delicious and rather potent summer wine, it captures the brisk cherry fruit without entangling it in too much tannin or herb. It's all about the fruit, and bravo for that."
Calendar Girl,Red Blend,85.0,18.0,1,"From a dark bottle, this salmon-colored rosé is medium-bodied and made in a bigger style than many others. Fully textured, it discloses flavorful touches of crunchy pear and cranberry. It would go well with a goat cheese salad adorned in dried cranberries and cherries."
Calendar Girl,White Blend,84.0,15.0,1,"From 100% estate-grown fruit, it spent more than a year in 100% French oak and is dense in baked strawberry, black cherry and a richness of herb. The grip of fruit is balanced by moderate acidity. The grapes are organically certified."
Calera,Chardonnay,91.0,42.0,2,"Well-aged, light gold, and bottled in a Burgundy bottle for reasons unknown, this off dry high-acid effort should be consumed within the next year or two. The apple fruit has moved into secondary (baked) flavors, with a tart kick to the finish suggesting that the acids may soon outstrip the fruit."
Calera,Pinot Noir,93.04,64.33,24,"This wine opens with just a touch of reduction followed by quite pure aromas of red and blue fruit. The flavors are sweet and fresh, with the tannins bringing a light grip."
Calista,Pinot Noir,90.0,25.0,1,"Tons of candied grape and lilac aromas show on the nose of this rather aged blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre, with root beer and blueberry-sorbet notes. The palate offers a similar array of sweet dark fruit, but the tannic structure and acidity clean it up nicely."
Caliza,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,93.0,62.0,1,"Coming from a site best known for its Syrah, this wine offers aromas of berry compote, funk and potpourri. The palate shows a pleasing sense of purity, with lightly astringent tannins providing a bit of distraction."
Caliza,Red Blend,93.0,54.0,1,"This is an earthy, stemmy wine, hugely concentrated and ripe in strawberry and rhubarb. Subtle in texture and bite, it shows a streak of cardamom on the finish."
Caliza,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,54.0,2,"Vibrant aromas of lychee, white flowers and spice give way to off-dry fruit flavors, with the concentration seeming a bit light. Still, it delivers a lot of appeal."
Caliza,Rhône-style White Blend,87.0,28.0,2,"Juicy in smoked cherry and a thick, velvety texture, this luxuriously pretty wine blends several estate blocks and clones. Forest floor, cola, clove, pine and black cherry highlight an integrated approach. It stays balanced and complex through a lengthy finish that further accentuates the spice."
Caliza,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,60.0,2,"Super earthy, this wine shows pomegranate, rhubarb and a touch of smoke, the aromas perfumed in rose petal. Medium bodied, it's balanced and elegant, with a streak of natural, lifted acidity."
Calla Lily,Pinot Noir,88.0,39.0,1,"Caramel-laced buttercream, marshmallow, cotton candy and sweet almond milk show on the nose of this bottling, named after one of Bill Foley's daughters. It's fairly light in body on the sprightly palate, where burnt marshmallow and vanilla flavors reign over the citrus elements."
Callan,Grenache Blanc,91.0,25.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon (54%) takes the lead on this blend, followed by Merlot (23%), Cabernet Franc (13%), Malbec (6%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of fresh herb, flower, pencil lead, cherry jam and spice lead to light tart, fresh fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of grip and dryness that hopefully smooths out with some additional time in the bottle but it has the stuffing to go the distance."
Callaway,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.67,81.0,3,"Brawny in tannin weight and grip, this tight-knit wine is impressively built and in tune with the vintage and its embrace of strength and complexity. Chalky texture is highlighted in tart mountain cherry, graphite and vanilla laced in clove. Enjoy best 2023–2033."
Callaway,Mourvèdre,90.0,30.0,1,"One of three Chardonnays named after the winemaker's daughters, the aromas draw you into the glass, with notes of lees, almond, melted butter, cream, peach and spice. All Clone 95, the tropical-fruit flavors are sweet, rich and layered. A touch of heat on the finish is the only thing that holds it back."
Callaway,Red Blend,88.33,48.0,3,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (67%), Merlot (26%) and Cabernet Franc. It's aromatically expressive, with notes of raspberry, cigar box, mint, café au lait, blackberry, dried herb, anise and wet gravel. The palate displays a sense of elegance and refinement that captures the attention, with red-fruit flavors lingering on the long (slightly warm) finish."
Callaway,Roussanne,88.25,30.0,4,"This is a single vineyard, 100% varietal wine, aged in 70% new French oak. It draws you into the glass, with notes of char, fig, blackberry, spice and coffee. The dark-roasted coffee and dark-fruit flavors show precision and detail, lingering on the finish. The wood is primary at present but should integrate with time."
Callaway,Sauvignon Blanc,84.0,20.0,1,"Light and spicy, this wine surprises and delights. It shows a tannic underbrush of firmness and grit that's seasoned in tart acidity and flavors of rhubarb, currant and black tea. It's well balanced and enjoyable now."
Callaway,Syrah,85.5,40.0,2,"Floral and fleshy, this is a big-boned, concentrated wine. A ripe rendering of apple, pear and peach is spiked in intriguing seasonings of lemongrass and nutmeg."
Calstar Cellars,Pinot Noir,89.0,40.0,1,"High-toned aromas of blackberry, aniseed, macerated cranberry, motor oil and flower lead to rich full-bodied cranberry and blackberry flavors that bring a sense of hedonism."
Camaraderie,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,38.0,1,"This blend of 45% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Freisa is very approachable and food-friendly, showing baked black-cherry pie, star anise and pine resin on the nose. The palate dries up with red plum and flashes of strawberry set against shaved clove spices. It's layered in flavor but softly textured."
Camaraderie,Cabernet Franc,88.0,29.0,1,"This is the third of three Chardonnays named after the winemaker's daughters. The aromas bring notes of clarified butter, lees, spice, pear, pineapple and other tropical fruit. The flavors are rich but still show restraint, with a lightly creamy feel and a long finish."
Camaraderie,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,40.0,1,"This Willow Creek district winery delivers a powerful blend of 71% Grenache, 19% Syrah, 9% Mourvèdre and 1% Viognier. It offers aromas of black licorice, black cherry and elderberry, with roasted meat in the background. It's very rich, bursting with flavors of blackberry and balsamic vinegar that evolve toward creosote and tar, all wrapped up in silky tannins."
Camaraderie,Dolcetto,89.0,29.0,1,"Michael Gill goes for broke booze-wise on this hot number, but the rewards are worth the risk. Aromas of blueberry, mint, graphite, dried cherry, lilac and graphite get a sagebrush lift. On the palate, distinct black licorice accompany blackberry syrup and white pepper. There's a slight bit of alcoholic burn on the finish, but it doesn't drink as hot as you'd guess."
Camaraderie,Malbec,87.0,28.0,1,"Light golden brown in color, this richly aromatic wine offers notes of brown sugar, dried pineapple, papaya and lychee. A whopping 270.8g/L residual sugar, it's thick, honeyed and sugary sweet with cinnamon, honey and granulated brown sugar flavors that linger on the finish."
Camaraderie,Merlot,91.0,38.0,1,"Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine dazzles the senses with notes of freshly roasted coffee, char, dark plum and sweet spices. It's medium bodied with thoroughly delicious coffee flavors backed by a soft feel."
Camaraderie,Red Blend,88.25,27.0,4,"The best of Glen Fiona's current releases, this displays cool-climate varietal character, with mountain berry fruit, herb, spice, tar and a streak of licorice."
Camaraderie,Sangiovese,89.0,29.0,1,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, young and fruity, with tart berry and bitter herb. The light but slightly green tannins add some useful counterpoint to the cherry pop fruit, giving the wine a more substantial palate impression and length in the finish."
Camaraderie,Syrah,87.0,28.0,2,"This budget wine has sweet fruit and soft tannins, along with surprising concentration and length. Offsetting a hint of stemminess are generous, varietally true flavors, and a rich, meaty nose that suggests beef and coffee. Best Buy. —P.G."
Camaraderie,Tempranillo,86.0,29.0,1,"Black cherry, clove and smoked meat aromas are rolled up into one wondrously savory scent in this 50-50 blend of Mourvèdre and Syrah. Flavors of beef roasted in blackberry and Sherry sauce sprinkled with oregano and marjoram entertain the complex palate."
Cambiata,Dornfelder,89.0,25.0,1,"Coming from a vineyard west of Paso Robles that peeks at the ocean surrounding Morro Rock, this is a dense expression of the grape, with dried strawberries, blackberries, smoked pork butt, star anise and lots of smoke on the nose. The palate is rich and lively, with decent mineral-driven restraint, showing a mouth-watering flavor array of dense blackberries and spicy Sichuan peppercorns."
Cambiata,Red Blend,91.0,45.0,1,"Made by Kirk Venge from a Dutton Ranch vineyard site, this wine immediately offers a lot to like, from its earthy sassafras and compelling layers of crisp raspberry and cherry, to its soft layers of oaky density accented in rose. Requiring more time to open, with an ideal cellaring through 2023, it finishes with a flair of cedar and vanilla, lasting long on the palate."
Cambria,Chardonnay,90.0,28.0,5,"A proprietary blend of 57% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Petit Verdot, all homegrown, this is dense and powerful, rich in red fruit but also savory in tobacco, black tea and leather. Reflective of the appellation's ability to combine power with elegance, it fully represents and should continue to meld beautifully together in the cellar. Drink now through 2022."
Cambria,Pinot Noir,89.67,35.83,6,"This reserve-level wine is down to just three barrels in this vintage. It's creamy and yet precisely defined, with generous layers of pineapple, lime, golden apple and lemon tea. A bracing minerality underscores gently oaked, finishing notes of melba toast and almond butter."
Cambridge & Sunset,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.5,14.0,2,"Planted in 1999 specifically for the producer, this vineyard block provides power and structure, revealing shocks of blackberry jam, mocha and gunpowder amidst a streak of wild anise and black pepper. Robust and bold, it begs for another 10 to 15 years in the cellar before finding its complete composure."
Cambridge & Sunset,Chardonnay,83.5,14.0,2,"From a three-acre vineyard, this wine accented in 2% Petit Verdot offers a sense of gravel underneath the dark, syrupy plum and leathery tannin structure. Midway through, it exhibits cherry, raspberry and vanilla, showing a juicy underbelly that should develop further over time. Drink now through 2022."
Cambridge & Sunset,Merlot,88.0,14.0,1,"From the producer's oldest hillside vineyard, planted in 1967, comes this gem of a wine, a taste of cinnamon toast and black currant. Layered acidity forms a backbone against which concentrated flavors of graham cracker and dark chocolate lie, the finish long and deep. It's built to age, enjoy now through 2025."
Cambridge & Sunset,Pinot Noir,84.5,14.0,2,"Voluptuously tropical in shaved coconut and silky layers of peach and pear, this is a complex, age-worthy white from a stellar vineyard site, a knockout version of the variety. Smooth and round, it maintains a core of acidity that buoys the experience, finishing with a flourish. Drink now through 2022."
Cambridge & Sunset,Zinfandel,88.0,14.0,2,"Creamy brie rind aromas mesh with scratched yellow grapefruit skin and a steely minerality on the nose of this small-batch bottling from a winery atop the appellation's ridgeline. Light and focused flavors of kumquat juice, iodine and lime skin satisfy the palate, and would be a perfect match for shellfish."
Cambridge California,Chardonnay,85.0,20.0,2,"One of the appellation's more famous wines, this opens in black licorice and blackberry, alongside a streak of malted chocolate, soft and sinewy, with a tension of acidity that adds age-worthy structure. Dense and interesting now, it'll get better over time, cellaring well through 2027."
Cameron Hughes,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.76,33.65,17,"This collaboration between American winemakers Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton and Japanese entrepreneur Takahide Sugimoto is stunningly high-toned and buttoned-up at first, with sour cream, yogurt, crushed ant, gunmetal, flint and quinine elements on the nose. The palate is complex and fascinating, with chalk and cement minerality bolstered by lime blossom, kumquat and tonic that opens graciously with time. Drink 2016–2026."
Cameron Hughes,Chardonnay,86.67,13.67,3,"The Fusion in question is the blend—an unusual combination of 61% Pinot Noir, 21% Syrah and 18% Merlot. Some tasters will find it works well as an everyday, all-purpose red. The jumble of red fruits is matched to a strong streak of vanilla, with some stemmy flavors coming up in the tannins."
Cameron Hughes,Meritage,92.0,18.5,2,"This wine seems to be a casualty of the cold vintage, with thin fruit and overall earthy flavors. A whiff of barnyard is evident as well."
Cameron Hughes,Pinot Noir,87.0,25.0,1,This smoky Zinfandel is aromatically closed off and still tight in tannic formation. Give it time to open and it'll share meaty black-fruit and tar.
Cameron Hughes,Red Blend,87.0,12.0,1,"A majority varietal, a dying breed in the Napa Valley, this also has 5% Petite Sirah. The combination is dense and syrupy in strawberry and a tightness of oak. Time will soften its edges, and there's already a softness to the tannins that delights, the finish light and lean. Cellar through 2017."
Cameron Hughes,Syrah,88.5,17.0,2,"Dense and concentrated, this smoothly rounded wine is well integrated and robust in oak and black cherry, a nice representation of estate grapes. With a strong presence of tannins, it needs to breathe before being enjoyed with earthy fare."
Cameron Hughes,Syrah-Grenache,87.0,14.0,1,"Faint aromatics hide an effusiveness on the palate of thick, dense blackberry jam and brown sugar, the ripe power of the wine kept in check by a balance of acidity. Fuller bodied in style, it remains dry and vibrant on the finish."
Cameron Hughes,Zinfandel,88.0,13.0,1,"Yellow skinned and Asian pears, jasmine flowers, lemon slices and a slight petrol note entertain the nose on this single-vineyard bottling from a part of the Parker family's estate that was planted in 1989. The palate is quite balanced between flavors of lemon-lime soda, tangerine juice and limestone minerality."
Camlow,Pinot Noir,93.0,45.0,1,"This affordable blend of all five Bordeaux grapes is a solid second wine, produced from barrels cut from the winery's other bottlings. It hits 14.5% alcohol but remains reasonably well balanced, with just a touch of heat. It's dark and smoky, with plenty of barrel flavors. Cherry liqueur, smoke, caramel and espresso—it gives you a lot of power for the price."
Campus Oaks,Zinfandel,85.0,12.5,2,"This blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Syrah and 17% Petit Verdot retains a reductive quality on the nose even after being opened for quite a while, with slightly funky blackberry and burnt cedar aromas. Dried blackberries and black cherries show on the palate, but the tarry sensation permeates throughout."
Cana's Feast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.5,42.5,2,"Full of vanilla and nougat aromas, this has a creamy texture, almost-sweet flavors and soft texture. Fermented in stainless steel and only 15% aged in oak, it's practically a pastry in a glass."
Cana's Feast,Primitivo,86.0,30.0,1,"Rich, tannic and brambly, a juiciness of blackberry jam forms the substantive core of this wine, made in larger quantities for larger distribution. The finish is leathery and well integrated in oak."
Cana's Feast,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,30.0,1,"Very ripe fruit aromas and flavors in this wine resemble dried plums and cherries. The texture feels broad and smooth, with enough firm tannins to give it some grip on the palate. It tastes full bodied and a bit exotic, with some anise and black pepper to enhance the dried-fruit notes."
Cana's Feast,Sangiovese Grosso,87.0,45.0,1,"This straightforward wine has notes of fresh apple and pear. The flavors are light in style, seeming a bit dilute."
Canihan,Pinot Noir,83.0,59.0,2,"Here is a tasty, light-bodied Zin with its own style and a great price. It has a minty, eucalyptus aroma and vivid raspberry flavors, almost sweet in balance. Medium-bodied, it delivers a lingering fruity finish."
Canihan,Syrah,87.0,49.0,1,"Sharp, pungent grass scents and a bit of rough citrus form the nose. Once sipped, thin and brisk apple cider flavors get help from slight kiwi and fresh acidity. Serve with bay scallop salad."
Canoe Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.19,27.25,16,"This Bordeaux-style white blend is 60% Sauvignon Blanc and 40% Sémillon. It carries a hint of sweetness, possibly some residual sugar above threshhold level. Flavors of butter cookie accompany simple, light yellow fruits."
Canoe Ridge,Chardonnay,87.0,17.83,6,"This Syrah is done in a surprisingly soft style, with light, peppery, rather pale fruit flavors. It's pleasant, but not a typical representative of the grape's usual power."
Canoe Ridge,Cinsault,87.5,28.0,2,"A boisterous, easy-drinking red wine that gushes ripe fruit and sweet oak aromas. It tastes almost sweet, like blackberry jam, and seems soft-textured in spite of its full body."
Canoe Ridge,Gewürztraminer,90.0,12.0,1,"This unoaked Chardonnay is awash in green apple, tart lemon and tropical pineapple, light and lifted on the palate. It goes down easily, and will track well at the table. Salads, seafood and brunch-type fare are all good bets."
Canoe Ridge,Merlot,88.45,30.55,11,"There are distinct and pleasant aromas of chalk and pear on the nose of this Grenache Blanc, one of the many Rhône-style wines made by this winery run by the family of the late actor-turned-vintner Fess Parker. It's a very straightforward sipper, not hugely complex, but refreshing and bright with slight nectarine flavors and lush pear."
Canoe Ridge,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,14.0,1,"Crisp citrus aromas and fresh lemon and grapefruit flavors define this medium-bodied, appetizing and unapologetic wine. With lots of personality, a tingly texture and tangy finish, it's just the thing for appetizers and first courses."
Canoe Ridge,Pinot Gris,85.0,15.25,4,"Sonoma's Roessler brothers deliver a great Grenache, with cinnamon spice, rose petals, squeezed strawberries and pie crust on the nose. Bright acidity shines on the palate, with red berries and strawberry spritzer flavors. Good tension between tannins and bitterness leads to a mouthwatering finish."
Canoe Ridge,Red Blend,88.0,21.29,7,"Brown calls this wine its Cab lover's Zin, blending 60% Zinfandel with Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah. It is a stunner, sultry in juicy red plum, cassis, currant and earthy tobacco. Tannins are soft and leathery, and all the varieties are well represented."
Canoe Ridge,Rosé,85.33,17.0,3,"From vines now a dozen years old, this unusual Walla Walla AVA Sauvignon Blanc is a brilliant straw color—aromatic with light scents of ripe grain and tangy fruits, and fills the mouth with delicious flavors of melon, white peach, lemon verbena and a dash of pepper. Complex and engaging, it finishes dry but leaves an impression of slight sweetness. Drink it slightly chilled."
Canoe Ridge,Sauvignon Blanc,84.5,15.5,4,"The blend is 50% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Cabernet Franc, aged in 100% new French oak. The only wine from this producer that is a blend, it currently shows an abundance of barrel flavors. The baking spices overpower some of the signature elements that this distinguished vineyard imparts—the mineral, saline, iron and steel notes often found in Ciel's red wines. The fruit remains gorgeously ripe, and with a bit more bottle age those subtle flavors may reappear."
Canoe Ridge,Syrah,89.0,40.0,1,"Zesty in black pepper and luscious in blackberry, blueberry and raspberry, the grapes are from 90-plus-year-old hillside vines. Complex and structured, it offers a balanced point of view and plenty of intrigue, simultaneously fresh and brooding."
Canoe Ridge,Tempranillo,89.0,40.0,1,"Warm, slightly sweet aromas of smoked applewood and hickory waft from this rich and decadent Syrah sourced from the Fess Parker estate. On the dark fruit-laced palate are black currant and cherry cola flavors, bolstered by black licorice and followed by a long finish of vanilla cream."
Canvasback,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,80.0,1,"The grapes are Demeter-certified Biodynamic in this 100% Zin, grown on a ridge-top vineyard overlooking the Dry Creek Valley. A fully realized, satisfying wine, it offers cherry vanilla, tar and toasty bacon among warm tones of complementary spicy cinnamon."
Capstone Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,83.0,27.0,1,"Searingly crisp and yet generous and intense, this Chardonnay from one of grower Ulises Valdez's prime properties is muscular and expansive, rich in apple and honey and a seasoning of mouth-tingling spice. It exemplifies California exuberance. Let it breathe for a while, or age 2020–2025."
Capstone Cellars,Cabernet Franc,83.0,21.0,2,"Still tight and young, this tastes like a keeper that will improve with time. Aged in all new American barrels, it shows aromas of coriander, cumin and smoke, with flavors like black cherry and black pepper. It balances well between firm tannins, good acidity and full flavors, and everything sails through the finish. Best after 2018."
Captûre,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,90.0,1,"Directly appealing, this wine is bursting with aromas of plum, red currant, herb and spice–all showing freshness and purity. The palate is packed to the brim with supple fruit flavors, full of density and weight, while never getting bogged down. It hits the delicious gong hard."
Captûre,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,45.0,1,"Concentrated boysenberry notes meet with intense aromas of purple flowers, especially lavender, on the nose of this blend of 78% Syrah and 22% Mourvèdre. A zesty acidity and silky tannins present a wide range of flavors on the complex palate, from blackberry and pepper to tarragon, mint and anise."
Carabella,Chardonnay,88.8,28.2,5,"Fresh, light and zesty on the nose, this bottling by South African winemaker Ernst Storm shows crushed raspberries, wild thyme and a touch of smoke on the nose. A tantalizingly vibrant energy excites the tongue once sipped, with flavors of tangy red fruit, smoked oregano and shaved pork roast showing on the palate."
Carabella,Pinot Gris,90.5,21.5,2,"Crushed slate, plush rose petals, red cherry, smoked beef, vanilla and a slightly feral quality arise on the nose of this bottling from the region's most iconic vineyard. There is great tension on the sip, with tart plum skin, bright raspberry and dark cranberry fruit meeting with black spice, sandalwood and incense flavors. Acidity binds it all together."
Carabella,Pinot Noir,89.92,45.5,12,"Vivacious on the nose, with hibiscus flowers, pomegranate, strawberry, rose petal and cola aromas, this bottling from a historic vineyard is both juicy and delicate at the same time. Vibrant flavors of cranberry, pomegranate, hibiscus and even red melon show on the palate, enhanced by dried fennel, sage and purple flowers."
Cardwell Hill,Pinot Gris,85.0,15.0,1,"Made from equal proportions of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this vintage sparkler is dry and doughy, with an inviting brightness of acidity. It sizzles in a lovely display of peach, nectarine and strawberry, with a slight nuance of vanilla and hazelnut, remaining dry and balanced through the lengthy finish."
Cardwell Hill,Pinot Noir,85.8,22.0,5,"This 100% varietal wine opens in crayon wax, pencil lead and black pepper. Brooding acidity complements the big, ripe fruit and sizable tannins, accented by hints of dried tobacco and cinnamon. This wine could stand a decant, vigorous swirl or cellaring, through 2028."
Caren,Albariño,88.0,25.0,1,"Blended with 10% Merlot, this wine sources grapes both from its famous estate, as well as from nearby Pickberry and Murray vineyards. It delights in luxuriously bright acidity and a jammy explosion of blackberry, chocolate, clove and tobacco, the texture roundly approachable."
Carhartt Vineyard,Grenache Blanc,89.0,23.0,1,"This bottling combines all the intriguing facets of this grape, from freshness to rusticity. The nose begins with strawberry, plum and mulberry wrapped in dust, leather and tan tobacco. Cinnamon and allspice kick off the palate, with light, refreshing cranberry fruit in the midpalate, dried leather and earth on the edges, and a thyme-oregano finale."
Carhartt Vineyard,Red Blend,90.0,43.0,2,"Brooding aromas of huckleberry, orange peel and flowers are followed by seamless full-bodied palate-coating blue-fruit flavors. It's far from shy but delivers the goods."
Carhartt Vineyard,Syrah,88.0,32.0,2,"Ripe black cherry, roasted meat, wet stone and caramel notes show on the nose of this bottling of a grape rarely seen in this region. It's slightly sweet on the palate, with ripe blueberry and cocoa flavors, but compelling for its novelty."
Carica,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,32.0,1,"Darker in color than many other versions of the variety, this bottling shows hearty charred meat, blackberry, gravel and condensed rose petal aromas. There's a leathery structure to the palate, where peppercorn, tobacco and red fruit notes lead into a mocha-laced finish.While it lacks the typical Cabernet Franc freshness, it has plenty of depth."
Carica,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,24.0,1,"Barrel influences takes over aromatically, with notes of wood, toast and dark chocolate in front of golden raisins, with the fruit seeming somewhat dried out. The palate brings tart cranberry and cherry flavors that show a sense of liveliness. Good things are going on but the aromas and palate seem a bit disconnected at present."
Carica,Syrah,89.0,39.0,1,"Coming from the winery's estate vineyard high up in Upper Mill Creek, this wine is starting to show a bit of age, offering aromas of anise, dried cherry, green pepper and cigar ash. Equal parts dark and green, the flavors come off a bit disjointed, with bell-pepper notes on the finish."
Caricature,Zinfandel,86.5,15.5,2,"NEXT is a new label for King Vintners, a new division of King Estate. This blends grapes from southern Oregon and the Willamette Valley, putting a pleasing toasty character around the light red fruit. A streak of burnt coffee suggests that the barrel influence is still being integrated."
Carina Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,36.0,1,"This wine's oaky entry derives from 10 months aging in French and American oak. It's creamy and voluptuous in style, with simple flavors of apple and a moderately long finish."
Carina Cellars,Syrah,92.0,36.0,1,"Fermented and aged entirely in stainless steel, this wine is dominated by tropical fruit, swimming in pineapple and banana aromas and flavors. Unfettered by oak, it boasts sizzling acidity and, while tasty, is somewhat one-dimensional."
Carivintas,Rosé,84.0,17.0,1,"This small-production wine is lightly spiced, robust and herbal. Dense and powerful wild strawberry and earth notes give it a sense of place."
Carlisle,Alicante Bouschet,90.0,36.0,1,"Rose and turned earth notes mark the entry of this concentrated, tannic wine. Robust strawberry and black cherry flavors fill it out, wrapped in toasted oak."
Carlisle,Grenache,92.0,38.0,1,"Merlot (32%), Sangiovese (31%) and Malbec (30%) make up the majority of this blend, with the balance Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of currant, plum and herb are followed by plump cherry flavors backed by lightly grainy tannins. It provides appeal and value."
Carlisle,Grüner Veltliner,91.67,31.33,3,"An earthy, leathery aromatic character carries over to the palate of this wine, joined by ripe plum flavors. The blend here is 53% Mourvèdre and 47% Syrah, feeling full-bodied, firmly tannic and ready for cassoulet."
Carlisle,Petite Sirah,95.0,50.0,2,"This wine is 80% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre and 10% Grenache. It brings unusual aromas of sawdust, mushroom, Band Aid, dark fruit and spice. The palate is lush and full, showing warmth on the finish."
Carlisle,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.67,45.0,3,"Petit Verdot (38%) takes the lead on this blend, followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (26%), Merlot (12%), Cabernet Franc (12%) and Malbec. The aromas come off as leafy and green, with notes of dates, flowers and spice. The palate is quite light and elegant, not having the heft to stand on its own. The extraction seems dialed way back."
Carlisle,Syrah,93.0,43.5,6,"Aromas are light, with notes of matchstick, herb and cherry. The cherry and plum flavors are sweet and generous, providing easy-drinking appeal."
Carlisle,White Blend,93.6,30.0,5,"This is a new cuvée for Trisaetum, from a vineyard in the Red Hills of Dundee. It shows some old vine character in its brambly, Burgundian elegance. Light flavors of raspberry and cherry float above a bed of clay, yet there is enough muscle for the wine to extend gracefully through a lingering finish, with a lick of chocolate. Enjoy it over the next decade or more."
Carlisle,Zinfandel,92.23,45.23,26,"Dark peach in color, the aromatics on this sparkling blend of 50% Chardonnay, 42% Pinot Noir and 8% Pinot Meunier are muted, but open in time to reveal wild strawberry and green apple. With structured acidity, expect a bite on the finish. Any kind of fresh seafood, especially oysters or calamari, would pair well here."
Carlson,Pinot Gris,89.0,20.0,1,"A fine effort in a cool year, this reserve combines the best barrels from the winery's three estate vineyards, which occupy three different sub-AVAs. Hence the Willamette Valley appellation. With excellent depth and power, it showcases a core of cherry, berry and chocolate, accented with sweet spices and a hint of fresh herb."
Carlson,Pinot Noir,89.0,40.0,1,"Brick red in color, this toasty, oaky Zin is grippy and satisfying. Thick on the palate with sweet, ripe tannins and a dusty texture, it's nicely balanced with a long finish that's inviting with meaty foods."
Carlson,White Blend,90.0,20.0,1,"This smooth, medium-bodied red combines Cabernet Sauvignon with Carignane, Merlot, Malbec and Syrah to satisfying effect. The Merlot and Malbec hail from the Russian River Valley's renowned Dakine Vineyard. It's soft in red cherry and blackberry fruit, but a structured wine with depth from leather and spice notes."
Carlton Cellars,Pinot Noir,91.0,45.0,1,"A nicely balanced Pinot Noir from an unlikely spot––Portola Valley, on the western side of Highway 280 across from Stanford University––and a newish small producer. It's on the bigger side of the Pinot spectrum but has admirable texture and cherry and earth aromas. Only 130 cases made. Worth trying to see what unconventional areas can do with the variety."
Carmel Road,Chardonnay,86.0,22.0,1,"Dark gold in color, this estate wine from hillside vines aged 11 months in one-third new French oak. Salty brine takes center stage before an unctuous pillow of caramel and honey rides along a full-bodied richness of flavor. A bright spark of lemony acidity marks the finish."
Carmel Road,Pinot Noir,87.0,31.5,2,"From Clare Ranch Vineyard in the Templeton Gap, this bottling by Ryan Render shows rounded notes of boysenberry and cooked blackberry on the nose alongside strong licorice and mocha aromas. Blackberry and boysenberry also arise on the sip, with olive, pepper and pretty violet floral flavors, all framed by a solidly dry structure."
Carol Shelton,Cabernet Sauvignon,83.0,40.0,1,"Beet and dark cranberry juice make for a very deep red-fruit entry to this bottling that is lifted by bay leaf, thyme and anise on the nose. It's easy, clean and refreshing in a lighter style on the sip, with dried strawberry and red plum spiced up by star anise and fennel."
Carol Shelton,Carignane,91.0,28.0,1,"This red blend relies mostly on Cabernet Sauvignon, adding smaller amounts of Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Soft, spicy and impressively lengthy, it's highlighted in blackberry, currant and toasty oak, concentrated and complex."
Carol Shelton,Petite Sirah,90.0,40.0,2,"Peppery, brambly, integrated and balanced, this impressively layered and complex 100% varietal wine highlights the grape's ability to be fruity, spicy and soft all at the same time."
Carol Shelton,Pinot Noir,86.5,30.0,2,"This blends 38% Merlot with 32% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc. Together these find a healthy companionship of wood, cedar, currant and dried herb, allowing the two Cabernets to speak loudest. Lightly spicy nutmeg and clove linger around well-defined layers of cherry and vanilla."
Carol Shelton,Red Blend,90.0,30.0,1,"After three years in tirage, this 78% Pinot Noir-22% Chardonnay sparkling blend reveals complex golden apple crisp and honeycomb notes. An homage to diversity, vanilla and peach purée tones add to the flavor of this richly rewarding, lively wine."
Carol Shelton,Rhône-style White Blend,90.0,24.0,2,"From a dry-farmed vineyard planted more than 50 years ago, this 100% varietal wine is highlighted in compost, leather and graphite. Well structured, with firm, strong tannins, it offers a tartness of pomegranate and black cherry along with a complexity of savory tobacco leaf."
Carol Shelton,Viognier,89.0,20.0,1,"Luscious and sleek in mouthfeel, and drenched with wonderful fruit flavors, this wine is a beauty. It has ample ripe fruit flavors like boysenberry and cherry pie without being literally sweet, while a sense of quiet concentration lasts on the lingering finish. It is structured with enough fine-grained tannin to age gracefully, so it's best to drink after 2019."
Carol Shelton,Zinfandel,89.71,28.43,7,"This perennial head-turner lives up to its pedigree in this vintage, offering a full-bodied, lush and plush experience characterized by soft layers of dark cherry, blackberry, vanilla and a seasoning of cinnamon. The vines are head-trained within a block planted to many other varieties, 15% of which make their way into this wine."
Carr,Grenache,89.0,35.0,1,"This wine is 100% varietal, aged entirely in French oak. Shy at first, it allows room for an earthy element of compost and is dark and brooding all around, with sizable, tamed, chalky tannin. Leather, black pepper, licorice and cinnamon all make an appearance, adding to the wine's complexity and likability."
Carr,Pinot Gris,86.0,22.0,1,"This is a Cabernet Sauvignon-driven blend, with 25% Merlot and 12% Petit Verdot. Generously oaky and ripe, it offers textured layers of graphite, cigar and cedar. An exciting sideshow of spicy Mexican chocolate accents deeper, darker shocks of black cherry."
Carter Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,52.0,1,"Aromatically reserved for a dessert wine, with apricot and pear. It's lusciously sweet, with abundant stone fruit flavors but could use a bit more concentration and acidity to hold it together."
Carter Estate,Chardonnay,89.0,32.0,2,Forward fruit flavors of blackberry and plum slide quickly through the mid-palate and on into a soft finish. A faint wash of leather and earth wraps it up.
Carter Estate,Red Blend,88.0,30.0,1,"The mirror image of the winery's Love-Struck Viognier, this broad and fruity blend is forward and open, with flavors of yellow and orange fruits. It is slightly toasty, moving into some citrus skin flavors that frame the finish."
Carucci,Grenache,90.5,38.0,2,"Juicy and plummy, this is a wine with generous amounts of purple fruit scents and flavors up front. The tannins turn a bit green and show some bitterness in the finish."
Carucci,Syrah,91.0,41.67,3,"This is a blend of wines from their 2011 and 2012 vintages, mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with a bit of Merlot, as well. Spicy cherry fruit combines with herbal notes and a hint of balsamic. It has an earthy undertone, but overall the fruit shines."
Casa Dumetz,Grenache,90.67,42.5,6,"Mondeuse is a specialty at Plaisance Ranch, but this new vintage seems a bit dilute. The anticipated flavors of huckleberry and elderberry come through, with less concentration than previously. There are hints of cedar bark, and some spice to the finish."
Casa Larga,Chardonnay,85.0,20.0,1,"This wine hails from the family's Eastside Road vineyard, planted to old Wente Chardonnay in 1982. It boldly opens in a robust, full-bodied explosion of ripe tropical mango and dried apricot, with an oaky underbelly that gives the texture grip and additional density."
Casa Nuestra,Cabernet Franc,90.0,48.0,1,"Principally Grenache (55%) and Mourvèdre (43%) topped off with a pinch of Viognier, this wine brings barrel-forward aromas of vanilla, toast and char along with red fruit. The cherry and plum flavors are lush, full and creamy but they struggle to get beyond the oak treatment."
Casa Nuestra,Cabernet Sauvignon,82.0,65.0,1,"Lees, peach and cream aromas are followed by dry stone-fruit flavors. It runs a little hot."
Casa Nuestra,Chenin Blanc,87.0,36.67,3,"Aromas of barrel spice, dried green herb, dried fruit and game lead to quite sweet black-cherry flavors, with gamy notes on the finish. It seems a bit dried out."
Casa Nuestra,Meritage,86.0,50.0,1,"Somewhat reserved on the nose, this shows raspberry, squeezed tangerine and orange blossom aromas with some swirling. The sip is quite high-toned at first, with wet slate flavors, then come slightly sweeter touches of wild berry and red cherry."
Casa Nuestra,Red Blend,85.0,42.5,2,"Decisions on the viticulture and winemaking for this wine were all crowdsourced by the winery. Light aromas of herb and barrel spice lead to plush, easy-drinking blue-fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
Casa Nuestra,Riesling,88.0,24.0,1,"Aged in American oak, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot offers a straightforward enjoyment of blackberry, tar and tobacco leaf with a side of bacon. Thick and bittersweet in tannin, it's an affordable red that will please many palates."
Casa Smith,Barbera,91.67,30.0,3,"This wine is a blend of several vineyard designates for the producer, including Campbell Ranch and Baranoff. It's pretty and floral, its aromatics an inviting mix of cinnamon-clove and cherry-plum. Exotically spiced in cardamom, it offers a tangy texture and lingering bite of oak on the finish."
Casa Smith,Primitivo,91.0,20.0,1,"Tasty, balanced and substantial in body, this wine accents bold berry and black cherry flavors with hints of vanilla and nutmeg. The fruit flavors go deep, while fine-grained tannins frame them perfectly for excellent overall structure and harmony."
Casa Smith,Sangiovese,92.0,20.0,1,"This is an elegant, even delicate vintage for this cuvée, with immediate impressions of wet stone, and fresh flavors of green melon, apple, celery and cucumber. The flavors are perfectly ripe and show good concentration, with lightly herbal highlights. Give this plenty of aeration as decanting would be helpful."
Cascade Ridge,Merlot,87.0,20.0,1,"This single-clone, estate-grown wine shows exemplary concentration. Deeply sculpted fruit flavors roll from peach to papaya, with streaks of buttery caramel. Everything is in proportion, with a most pleasing finish."
Cascata,Chardonnay,87.0,19.0,1,"Inky dark in the glass, this blend of 48% Syrah, 39% Grenache and 13% Mourvèdre offers up dense and potent blackberry and blueberry fruit aromas, enhanced by black pepper and bacon-fat richness. Blackberry fruit starts the sip and then it deepens into earth, tobacco and smoke. It's a fine study of darkness."
Cascata,Riesling,84.5,17.0,2,"Tasted alongside the 2013, this is bigger, bolder, fruitier and more powerful, yet a touch less refined. The strawberry and cherry fruit is underscored with a pleasing minerality. The tannins are substantial and in proportion. A hint of chicken stock runs through the finish."
Casey Flat Ranch,Red Blend,88.67,23.67,3,"Cherry tomatoes, black olives, Kalamata olives, green olives, black pepper and dried herbs show on the nose of this zesty wine, done in a lavish not sparse manner. A rainbow of peppercorns pop on the palate, touching on the grape's herbaceous tendencies and showing tagine and tapenade flavors, but with tons of vibrancy and freshness. A well-done version of this flavor profile."
Cass,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,30.0,1,"Sourced from vines almost 40-years-old, this is tight and spicy, with a potpourri of herbs from mint to tarragon to chive. The core of wild berry fruit is substantial. Don't miss the trailing finish. There's lots to taste in the tail of this comet."
Cass,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,49.0,1,"Hay yellow in color, with a wispy shade of pink in the core, this bubbly shows aromas of lemon chiffon, sourdough toast, white peach and a touch of quinine on the nose. Lemon peel and curd show strongly on the palate, laid across a salted cracker flavor—quite delicious and refreshing at once."
Cass,Rhône-style White Blend,89.0,26.0,2,"A clean and crisp style of Viognier, which comes in all forms these days, this bottling is light yet expressive on the nose with yellow grapefruit, lemon ice and a touch of chamomile tea. The palate is very grippy with crushed rocks, and also rich with buttered pear in the creamy, almost buttery midpalate, yet somehow remains lean and laser-focused."
Cass,Rosé,88.0,22.0,1,"A 100% varietal wine aged in entirely new French oak, this is a big-bodied, grippy wine. It's slightly syrupy with ripe red fruit and a complexity of dried herb and cedar which makes it a fine representative of the relatively cooler appellation from which it comes."
Cass,Syrah,91.0,49.0,1,"Classic flavors, great structure and impressive depth make this wine tempting to drink now, but it will certainly improve with age. Hints of light nutmeg and coriander mingle with stronger blackberry and black pepper in the aromas and flavors. It has that slightly wild, gamey character of the Rhône, along with ripe but slightly restrained fruit and spices. Best from 2018 to 2023."
Cast,Zinfandel,88.0,44.0,1,"Whiffs of wood smoke, black pepper and clove bring an exotic touch to this dry, medium-bodied and tautly balanced wine. It stops just short of full ripeness, but has ample enough blackberry and black olive flavors to taste complete and to reverberate on the finish. It has great varietal character, and will be interesting to age through 2019."
Castel Grisch,Chardonnay,84.0,15.0,1,"Dried black fruits, cedar, tobacco and just a few dried purple flowers show on this wine's slightly sour nose. The palate is a bit flat, with purple berries, tar and tobacco flavors that come and go quickly."
Castel Grisch,Vidal Blanc,87.0,25.0,1,"This 76% Cabernet Franc and 24% Malbec blend pushes the coolness of the vintage and the appellation in its extremely herbal, woody nose, a taste of bell pepper rising midway through its lean palate. It finishes round and soft."
Castello di Amorosa,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.33,137.17,6,"There's a chalky tartness to this young wine, a single-vineyard designate from a consistent source. Gravenstein apple and a suggestion of honey star on the nose and palate around a medium body and finish."
Castello di Amorosa,Chardonnay,91.0,38.0,1,"An earthy rusticity marks this wine, soft in black cherry, with a rich, smooth texture and grippy, tongue-coating finish of leathery tannin."
Castello di Amorosa,Pinot Noir,88.5,72.0,2,"This wine has a deep-gold color, attractive baking-spice and buttered popcorn aromas, appealing apple and pear flavors and medium body. The texture is soft and easy and the acidity tastes low."
Castello di Amorosa,Red Blend,91.0,91.5,2,"This wine requires decanting, as it seems to have entered a dumb phase. But there is clearly a good core of blackberry and black cherry fruit, lightly dusted with fresh herb."
Castello di Amorosa,Rosato,88.0,26.0,1,"A mix of unidentified red varieties, this wine opens slowly, without much in the way of aromatics. Weedy sage, tobacco and a grip of tannin give it weight and richness alongside its full body, as a bramble of blackberry and currant weave within."
Castello di Amorosa,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,94.0,89.0,1,"This 100% varietal wine offers a simplicity of blueberry, black licorice and chocolate wrapped in integrated tannin and oak. Full bodied and ripe, it softens in the glass to a rounded finish."
Castello di Borghese,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,83.0,10.0,1,"Golden Delicious apple, stone fruit and honey star in this vineyard-designate, a showcase for baked apple seasoned in nutmeg. Gravelly texture supports full-bodied flavor and a strength of toasted oak lightly suggestive in vanilla."
Castello di Borghese,Chardonnay,82.0,14.0,1,"Though this is their appellation blend, Mikey Giugni and Michael Brughelli don't hold back, offering elegant aromas of rose petals, purple flowers, rich pomegranate fruit, rusty strawberries and light vanilla on the nose. The palate begins with a light cranberry-raspberry flavor that deepens into tart mulberry before showing dried rose petals, uncrushed clove and a lava-rock minerality."
Castello di Borghese,Merlot,82.0,18.0,1,"Light, bright and citrusy, this lovely wine is integrated in terms of oak and ripeness, letting its crispness of lemon and tangerine speak loudest. A complex, structured wine, it becomes more interesting as it opens, allowing room for specks of stone and nutmeg to peek through."
Castello di Borghese,Pinot Blanc,82.0,10.0,1,"Warm tones of marzipan, roasted almond, yellow peach, pineapple and a touch of coconut are reminiscent of a piña colada on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard just behind the coastal town of Cambria. Gala apples and poached pears show on the sip along with lemon curd, chalk and meringue flavors, all tightly woven into a fresh expression of the grape."
Castello di Borghese,Pinot Noir,83.5,22.5,2,"Bright and ready-to-burst flavors of raspberry and just-ripe cranberry show on the nose of this bottling that also features tartness and graphite minerality alongside vanilla and baking spice. More of an underripe character shows on the forest-floor palate, where thyme and marjoram mix with tangy red fruit, pine needle and juniper."
Castello di Borghese,White Blend,83.0,7.0,1,"Deep aromas of hibiscus, rose buds, dark red berries and sugar plums are spiced up by cola, crushed pencils and lots of garrigue on this bottling. The palate is clean and crisp, with snappy raspberry, light cranberry and lots more chaparral-like herbs, including wild thyme, bay laurel, lavender and fennel pollen."
Castillo De Feliciana,Albariño,87.0,24.0,2,"Plump tangerine, pink grapefruit and warmer tones of Gala apples show on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard that's slightly northwest of the Sta. Rita Hills appellation. Rounder nectarine and apple flavors show on the sip that fattens up in the midpalate with poached Asian pear and popcorn, deftly leveled throughout with a zesty lemon-wedge touch."
Castillo De Feliciana,Chardonnay,88.0,30.0,3,"Violets, bacon fat and caramel sauce are drizzled across blueberry and olallieberry fruits on the nose of this bottling from Billy Wathen and Dick Dore. The palate is expertly integrated and deep with flavors of blackberry, pepper dust, tart black-plum skins, cocoa powder and roasted pork. It conveys classic Syrah flavors, done with grace."
Castillo De Feliciana,Malbec,87.5,39.75,4,"This small-production, single-vineyard white hails from a site at the southern end of the appellation, close to Carneros. It shines in golden apple, honey graham cracker and a rich texture that impresses from start to finish. A floral element persists and intrigues, a mix of wildflower and fennel."
Castillo De Feliciana,Pinot Gris,87.0,16.0,1,"Meant to showcase the producer's classic style, this is made from 74% Pinot Noir and 26% Chardonnay, the lots chosen for their fruit forwardness. Succulent peach speaks quietly around bright floral aromas, while a richer undertone of hazelnut biscotti comes into play on the smooth palate."
Castillo De Feliciana,Red Blend,87.0,60.0,2,"This new project from the heights of Atlas Peak involves Steve Matthiasson as both viticulturist and winemaker, having had to take over the reins from the late Denis Malbec. It shines in bristling acidity, dusty tannin and a beautiful floral aroma of violet. Notes of chocolate, fig and cigar sit atop a pillowy, complex structure, while vanilla lingers on the finish."
Castillo De Feliciana,Tempranillo,86.83,29.0,6,"This bottling of the classic Italian variety hits the right notes, with cherry, rose and tar on the nose, along with hints of sandalwood and incense. It's smooth on the palate, with dried cherry flavor and touches of chocolate, dried mint and caramel on the finish. It's still young and the firm tannins ensure a long life. Drink 2018–2029."
Castillo's Hillside Shire,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.5,72.0,2,"This is a blend of 45% Syrah, 33% Grenache and 22% Mourvèdre. Strong aromas of eucalyptus leaves dominate a thick tannic concentration of dark cherry and cassis with a light simplicity to the finish."
Castillo's Hillside Shire,Petite Sirah,88.0,36.0,1,"The Kingpin Cabernet leans into the flavors of savory herb and leaf, with peppery accents to the light strawberry fruit. It's a pleasant, relatively light style that fades into a gentle finish."
Castle Rock,Pinot Noir,87.75,16.5,4,"This blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, sends up toasty aromatics richly imbued with the scents of new oak. John Bookwalter consistently makes wines in this style, which in a cooler year such as 2010, can seem to mask the fruit. Give it plenty of breathing time and the blackberry and black cherry core will begin to emerge from the toast, mocha and coffee."
Castle Rock,Red Blend,86.0,14.0,1,"Complex in Middle Eastern and baking spices, Occasio's Petite Sirah is meant to be a tribute to the Livermore Valley's early days of viticultural promise and it delivers in a modern way. With a juicy mouthfeel of red and black fruit, it retains vibrant acidity and finishes long."
Casto Oaks,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,25.33,3,"Decadent in coffee, toffee and caramel tones, the leathery mouthfeel of this wine is met head-to-head by a juiciness of ripe, dense blackberry fruit. An approachable Petite Sirah that will also please lovers of the variety's chewiness and concentration."
Casto Oaks,Port,86.0,12.0,2,"The nose on this bottling shows fresh boysenberry and primary grape scents, with lots of sweet rosemary and purple flower nuance. The sip is not overly complicated, with tar at first and then waves of blackberry and boysenberry fruit, lifted by thyme and peppercorns."
Casto Oaks,Red Blend,86.0,12.0,1,"Aromas of Band-Aid, herb, cranberry and cherry lead to elegantly styled fruit flavors. Chewy tannins and tart acids provide the frame."
Castoro Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,16.0,1,"This 100% varietal wine is made in a seemingly light-handed style, lean on the palate in graphite and tart cherry, with a diluted edge. It gains succulence in the glass, with a juicy overlay of tobacco and cinnamon-dusted raspberry."
Castoro Cellars,Chardonnay,91.0,15.0,1,"The aromas of gooseberry, lime, herb and passion fruit pop. The flavors are broad and tart. The concentration isn't quite all there but it brings plenty to hold the interest and should do well at the dinner table."
Castoro Cellars,Falanghina,88.0,30.0,1,"The personal project of longtime Souverain winemaker Ed Killian, this is a rich, round and full-bodied white, offering sizable components of baked pear and apple, the oak toasty and integrated."
Castoro Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,15.0,1,Pressed black plum and crushed dill team up for a lively and fresh nose on this bottling that also offers tobacco and coffee aromas. Woody cedar flavors lead the palate that is full of lighter-toned strawberry and red-plum fruit. Black pepper adds spice and pencil lead adds minerality.
Castoro Cellars,Syrah,89.0,24.0,1,"This is the winery's inaugural vintage of this wine, which blends Birch Creek Grenache (57%) and Mourvèdre (14%) with estate Syrah. The aromas pop, with notes of stargazer lilies, dried tobacco, white pepper and red fruit that lead to soft, silky, very pretty fruit flavors."
Castoro Cellars,Tempranillo,88.0,24.0,1,"This blend of 59% Roussanne, 36% Grenache Blanc and 5% Viognier is very lemony on the nicely restrained nose that also offers mango, yellow apple and grapefruit pith. Once sipped, the wine is wide and welcoming with red and yellow apples, Meyer lemon and tangerine flavors, proving quite easy-drinking."
Castoro Cellars,Viognier,90.0,22.0,1,"Generously filling and satisfying, this Bordeaux-styled blend is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. It's medium in oak and tannin, with a toasty character underlying red cherry, currant and cassis, the ending marked by cedar and clove."
Castoro Cellars,Zinfandel,89.0,22.8,5,"Spicy, slightly resinous with notes of leaf, clove and licorice that complement good dark cassis fruit. Some coffee and smoke enter into the middle and finish, though the flavors fall away rather quickly. It's well balanced and a pleasure to drink, but not built for cellaring."
Caterina,Merlot,88.0,20.0,1,"A Cabernet Sauvignon-like version of Petit Verdot, this has tame tannins and is all around soft and mellow, with straightforward berry and cedar notes. It would make a fine food wine."
Cathedral Ridge,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,26.0,1,"Savory aromas of bay leaf and fennel pair with mushrooms and freshly turned dirt on this single-vineyard wine. The flavors are also more earthy than fruity, with oregano, thyme, tea, espresso, cola and only a hint of cranberry. The tannins are strong, so this will last for a few years."
Cathedral Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,82.0,48.0,1,"An aromatically intriguing wine with notes of pepper, cherry cola, chocolate and herbs. It's medium bodied, flavorful with generous cherry notes and a fleshy feel."
Cathedral Ridge,Chardonnay,85.67,30.67,3,"This was pressed whole-cluster and fermented in French oak, roughly one-third new. It's a flavorful wine with caramel apple appeal, good definition and medium length. The barrels put a pleasing toasty frame around the finish."
Cathedral Ridge,Merlot,85.0,32.0,1,"Steel is the medium and the message, meaning it's completely unoaked, with no malolactic fermentation. The flavors are spicy and bright, mixing cucumber, mint and green melon with a dash of white pepper."
Cathedral Ridge,Pinot Noir,85.0,32.0,2,"Perfumed and aromatically distinctive wine, it carries notes of juniper, sagebrush, black pepper and cranberry. It's soft and sultry, lighter in feel, narrowing toward the finish."
Cathedral Ridge,Red Blend,86.33,30.67,3,"The nose is lifted with bright spice and suggestions of pungent herbs. Black fruits carry a touch of mocha and lead into a crisp, moderately tannic finish. Balance and length are excellent."
Cathedral Ridge,Syrah,84.0,48.0,1,"Layered in ripe red fruit like cassis and currant, it offers smoothness amidst grippy tannins and savory suggestions of toasty oak, black tea and soy. All need air and time to develop more fully. Pair with a classic pepper steak and garlicky mashed potatoes."
Cathedral Ridge,Zinfandel,85.0,38.0,1,"Smooth and soft in the mouth, this has rich cherry flavors and a generous amount of caramel and chocolate from barrel aging. It's a palate-pleasing wine, straightforward and probably at its drinking peak."
Catman,Rosé,86.0,28.0,1,"Les Collines is one of the most exciting Syrah vineyards in the state and this wine, which all comes from Block 30 and saw only neutral barrels, expresses this site exquisitely. It opens with aromas of violets, rubbed herb, smoked meat and purple fruit. The palate brings a mesmerizing sense of purity, with mouth-coating seamless fruit and savory flavors. It drinks well on its own but is really designed for the dinner table."
Cattleya,Chardonnay,93.0,70.0,1,"This cleanly made wine has potential to live long in the cellar. Intensely focused aromas of black raspberry and black plum combine with crushed asphalt and a touch of purple flowers on the nose. The tightly wound palate slowly reveals tart boysenberry, char and pine resin, flavors that the firm structure will reveal even more deliciously with time. Drink 2018–2029."
Cattleya,Pinot Noir,92.0,77.5,2,"Velvety on the palate, this coastal wine from a site three miles from the Pacific Ocean shows cool-climate savory tones of cranberry, rose petal and pine, with streaks of black licorice adding to the complex range of flavor. Integrated and lushly elegant, it finishes in a strong touch of cardamom."
Cattleya,Syrah,93.5,70.0,2,"Quite dark in the glass, this meticulous blend of 47.32% Mourvèdre, 42.18% Syrah, 7.5% Petite Sirah and 3% Grenache shows rich, nose-tickling aromas of dried purple flowers, dark blueberry, caramelized blackberry and a touch of vanilla. The palate perfectly pairs dark fruit and bright acidity with touches of caramel and a tar-like structure. It's big, yet balanced."
Cavatappi,Nebbiolo,87.5,26.0,2,"From the producer's mountain estate, and blended with 7% Malbec, this wine is chalky in blue fruit, with a hearty back-palate of tannin. The grit softens in the glass, revealing nuanced elegance and shades of nutmeg, cherry and blueberry brightness."
Cavatappi,Red Blend,91.0,23.0,1,"Dark in color and deep in heavily ripened fruit flavors, this full-bodied, concentrated wine is a show-stopper. A quiet sense of power comes from the dried plum and raisin aromas and the rich blueberry, clove and dark-chocolate flavors. This is a keeper that will be best to drink after 2020."
Cavatappi,Sangiovese,87.0,21.0,1,"Blended with 12% Grenache, aromas of blackberry, caper, fresh herb, cranberry, mineral and spice are followed by full-bodied, lush black-fruit flavors, with white pepper and raw meat notes that persist on the finish. It flat out impresses, bringing a compelling sense of balance."
Cave B,Barbera,82.0,22.0,1,"This medium-weight wine shows a crispness of style and provenance. Caramelized oak is softened and made fruity by the taste of apple skin and pear. Stony mineral is given additional freshness by layers of lemon peel and orange zest, finishing focused and clean."
Cave B,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.25,49.5,4,"Red-cherry sauce, sagebrush, bay leaf and peppercorns show on the nose of this bottling that offers an intense density of aromas. The structure is firm and grabs hold of the palate, where flavors of tart red cherry, chaparral and slate combine."
Cave B,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,41.5,2,"Light cranberry and pomegranate show on the nose of this always-anticipated bottling by Dan Lee, with a pine-needle aroma to provide depth. The slightly sour flavor of Montmorency cherries mixes with snappy cranberry and underripe red currants on the sip, which gains herbal and peppery spice complexity as it breathes."
Cave B,Chardonnay,87.0,19.0,2,"This is the producer's first release from this site. It succeeds wildly with its juicy, tart flavors of cranberry and red cherry that become fleshy and concentrated on the palate. Complex and delicious, it finishes with a thickness of toast and black tea."
Cave B,Malbec,85.0,38.0,1,"This wine is a blend of equal parts Art Den Hoed, Lawrence, Red Heaven and Stoney Vine vineyard fruit, with the latter stealing the show. The aromas pop, with notes of grilled asparagus, black and green olive, ember, wet rock and moist earth. The palate is chock-full of earth, smoked meat and other savory flavors that bring a textured feel and linger on the finish."
Cave B,Merlot,85.0,32.0,3,"The aromas are brooding initially, opening up over time to reveal notes of tar, dried herb, smoked meat, black olive, potpourri , orange peel and white pepper. The palate brings a real sense of freshness and intensity, with notes of flowers and earth. Lemon-twist and orange-peel notes brighten and focus the flavors."
Cave B,Red Blend,84.0,22.0,1,"This is a cool-climate expression of Syrah from a biodynamically farmed vineyard west of the Sta. Rita Hills. The nose shows extreme tar, beef char, cracked black pepper and bay leaf, with gamy undertones. The tightly wound palate combines dusty elderberry with charcoal, more pepper and a lavender-rosemary flash on the finish."
Cave B,Rosé,84.0,18.0,1,"Aromas of pomegranate, black fruit, herb and barrel spice lead to rich seamless palate-coating dark-fruit flavors. It's hedonistic but retains a sense of balance along with an unabashed deliciousness."
Cave B,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,20.0,1,"This full-bodied, concentrated wine shows plenty of power in its bringing together of the variety with smaller percentages of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. With a huge presence on the palate that lingers and stays in one's brain, it shows a reductive quality of toasted oak along with black pepper, bark and leather saddle,. It's a wine to enjoy from a giant leather chaise, if possible. Cellar until 2023."
Cave B,Syrah,83.0,25.0,2,"A wine marking the 50th anniversary of Robert Mondavi Winery's founding, this shows the grandeur of the man, the vineyard and the vintage. Full bodied and robust, it's intense in bark, tar and black licorice, with dottings of coconut. Aromatically inviting, it's dusty and soft, with acres of complexity and structure. Enjoy it in 2023 and beyond."
Cave B,Tempranillo,83.5,25.0,2,"From the beautiful, historic site planted to some of the oldest vines of the variety in Northern California, this delicious white explodes in juicy green apple and an intensity of fresh-squeezed lemon. That succulence lingers atop a lengthy, salty texture wrapped in subtle, supportive oak."
Cave B,Viognier,89.0,20.0,1,"Sultry aromas of black plum, violet, lava rocks, smoke, caramelized beef, forest floor and star anise draw the nose into this hearty, well-rounded wine. There is both vibrant energy and tannic grip to the palate, with dense, dark cranberry, tangy fruit skins, a touch of vanilla and a minty fennel element on the finish."
Cave B,White Blend,86.0,21.33,3,"From the Happy Canyon-based team behind the ultra luxury Crown Point project comes this bottling, offering a taste of the high life for a slightly more affordable price. Pressed blueberry, black cherry and sour plum aromas mesh with dried oregano, bay leaf, black pepper and pencil shavings on the nose. There's lots of depth to the palate, with dark olallieberry, eucalyptus oil and pine needle flavors leading into a hazelnut, caramel, coffee and vanilla finish."
Caymus,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,180.0,1,"From stunningly set vines overlooking the Carmel Valley that in this vintage produced only 1.25 tons an acre (or 1.12 pounds per plant) comes this stellar wine, redolent on the nose with black plum, mulberry, turned earth, wet mud, woody sagebrush, incense and sandalwood. There is great energy on the palate, with mulberry and elderberry flavors enhanced by light coffee, soil and fennel bulbs."
Cayuga Ridge Estate,Chardonnay,85.0,14.0,1,"Black in the glass and dense with aromas of cooked blueberry, vanilla, maple syrup, brown sugar, tar, fudge and fresh purple flowers, this wine takes ripeness and concentration to impressive heights. Lavish on the palate with sticky, grippy tannins, the flavors of blueberry fudge, cola, black pepper and lavender are bold and delicious."
Cayuse,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,86.43,7,"This is a stellar wine. Dusty citrus spiked with clove comes to mind first aromatically and continues through to the palate. Tart acidity supports sublime texture and a lightness that never means lean. Red currant, grapefruit and orange provide additional lift and focus."
Cayuse,Cabernet Franc-Merlot,93.0,80.0,1,"Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard behind the winery in the western shade of Oakville, this wine opens with charred oak and a smoky, meaty character that intrigues. Seamless on the palate in soft, perceptible tannin, it delves into characteristics of cedar and brushy sage as it goes, unveiling a wildness that's hard to contain. Its bright, fresh finish gives it a roundness that's ready to enjoy now."
Cayuse,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.29,82.86,7,"Bringing together multiple sites in one wine, this provides a fine example of the sum equalling more than the parts. Well balanced and crafted, it offers aromas of sandalwood and smoked meat that contrast with more exuberant, textured layers of black cherry and citrus peel."
Cayuse,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,95.5,72.5,2,"Plump yet bright with fruit, suave yet spicy with herbs and gamy elements, this bottling shows candied cherry and cranberry alongside sage, eucalyptus and slight barnyard notes. The same juicy red fruit immediately elevates the palate, which is then leveled by lively Mediterranean spice and a buoyant acidity."
Cayuse,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,91.5,93.5,2,"This winery's bottlings manage to pack bright, fruity energy and a wide array of herbs and seasonings into the same lithe frame. In this case, sagebrush and chaparral meet candied red cherry and dark pomegranate on the nose. The palate shows lots of oregano, thyme and bay leaf against a ripe cranberry base, with touches of black tea and rosehip adding to the complexity."
Cayuse,Grenache,93.83,80.83,6,"Site speaks loudly in this beautifully made wine that is allowed to show its naturally inclined power within a constraint of cool-climate terroir. Juicy and explosive on the palate in cherry, raspberry, forest floor and jolts of cardamom, it's both lush and toasty, with a firmness to the tannin structure that suggests plenty of aging potential. It should get pretty interesting between 2024 and 2034, if one can possibly wait."
Cayuse,Red Blend,92.6,90.8,5,"Softly layered, this ripe, bold wine shows a wealth of body and complexity. The ripeness will please for its interwoven notions of Dr Pepper, black-cherry jam and black pepper, its tannins leathery and full of bravado."
Cayuse,Rosé,90.33,45.0,6,"There is impressive depth to the nose of this bottling, with concentrated black cherry, black plum and blueberry fruit enhanced by white pepper, roasted meat, licorice and hot asphalt. The palate is awash in savory flavors, with soy, charred beef and tobacco followed by waves of blueberry and leather and a wash of vanilla, plum skin and mocha, all atop perfectly polished tannins."
Cayuse,Syrah,95.18,88.74,34,"This wine is made to highlight the vintage and best vineyards, relying heavily on the producer's top-end site, Sacrashe. A hugely constructed wine, bold and brawny, it also manages to be soft and velvety, allowing for a greater contribution of savory elements than sweet, from leather to black pepper to Mexican chocolate. It pushes the boundaries on decadence in mysterious ways."
Cayuse,Tempranillo,93.6,86.0,5,"The aromas begin with a pretty violet character, around plum and smoke. Flavors are tightly wound and balanced, with sharp acids. This slowly opens over many hours of breathing time to unveil smooth, soft fruit, light herbs, pretty floral highlights and great texture."
Cayuse,Viognier,92.5,71.67,6,"Half of the wine was fermented with native yeasts, and 30% saw new oak. What shines is the juicy, fresh, delicious fruit—a jumble of raspberries and cherries—plus the finish, which hangs deliciously."
Cebada,Chardonnay,90.67,39.0,3,"This is the reserve of the Erath lineup and the winery's best effort—along with the Battle Creek bottling—in 2010. Pretty scents and flavors of raspberry and rose water mingle with the ripest cherry fruit in the lineup. Focused, balanced and elegant."
Cebada,Pinot Noir,90.0,34.0,3,"This is a spicy, lively wine with interesting flavors of black cherry cola. It's not a big wine, but it offers a mouthful of pleasure."
Cedar Creek,Syrah,89.0,36.0,1,"This is the best of the new releases from Seven Bridges, a Portland-based winery with a penchant for Washington State fruit. Smooth, balanced and mouth-filling, this offers a truffle highlight that sits over the bright berry and cherry flavors."
Cedar Mountain,Petite Sirah,86.0,28.0,1,"The Mark V bottling usually gets the most new oak, but in this light vintage the wood has been kept in check. Tasted prerelease, it blossomed over several hours, similar in style and flavor to the winery's Reserve, possessing fine balance and a pretty red-fruit flavor."
Cedar Mountain,Port,85.0,40.0,1,"This shows a somewhat more concentrated midpalate than the regular bottling, though all of the Anam Cara Pinots share common ground. This is a balanced, elegant wine, offering a mix of strawberry, earth and pepper flavors all done with a delicate hand."
Cedar Mountain,Sauvignon Blanc,82.5,13.5,2,"Dark gold in color, this decadent wine is robust in toasted chestnut and hazelnut layers which are rich and powerful on the seamless palate. The oak shows prominently on the nose and palate but finds its balance on the finish, allowing the wine to end with polish and reserve."
Cedar Mountain,Zinfandel,84.0,33.0,2,"The aromas draw you in with notes of kiwi, pineapple and mango. Brown sugar and tropical fruit flavors are intensely sweet and rich, with an unctuous feel."
Cedar River Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,83.0,30.0,1,"Brawny in flavorful black cherry, this well-crafted wine from a prime vineyard is plush with cinnamon and structured tannins. Floral in aroma, it tastes of strawberry and black cherry, with a seasoning of black pepper on the finish. Drink now through 2023."
Cedar River Cellars,Cabernet Franc,87.0,40.0,1,"With the fruit coming from Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills and Yellow Jacket vineyards, this winery's inaugural Walla Walla Valley release displays complex aromas of coffee, smoked meat, mineral, blueberries, violets and licorice. The dark coffee flavors are concentrated and dense, coming in waves and leading to an extended finish."
Cedar River Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,83.0,33.0,1,"Gravel, asphalt and iron drive the minerally nose of this bottling, which also shows cigar box, cherry leather, stewed strawberry and chocolate-caramel aromatics. There is plenty of both tannic grip and vibrant acidity once sipped, with cherries, cranberries and oregano elements making for a saucy palate. Drink 2017–2025."
Cedar River Cellars,Malbec,87.0,40.0,2,"A brand-new offering from this producer that usually traffics in Anderson Valley Pinot Noir from its own estate, this initial attempt at a white wine is stunning, a well-honed marriage between site and winemaker. Thick and expansive on the palate, it's a complex study in succulent apple and ginger, with a mineral-laden finish."
Cedar River Cellars,Merlot,82.0,25.0,1,"This wine is 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 19% Cabernet Franc. It's aromatically brooding, with notes of high-toned dried herbs and dark cherries. The flavors are textured and palate-coating, with firm tannins backing them up. Just a baby now, it has a long life in front of it. Enjoy after 2021."
Cedar River Cellars,Red Blend,83.0,25.0,1,"With just 1% each of Cabernet and Merlot, this wine is darker in color, and offers pretty while dense aromas of concentrated violet, hot brick and boysenberry juice. It's dense and grippy on the palate, but quite lively with flavors of dried blackberry, pepper spice, black slate minerality and, on the finish, semisweet chocolate."
Cedar View Winery,Syrah,87.0,21.0,1,"Substantive in oak and weight, this concentrated, estate-grown wine is impressive in velvety texture and a savory conjuring of tobacco and black tea. Dark, brambly blackberry and dark cherry join in on the fun, providing vibrancy amid all the sophistication. Finishing with a dash of cardamom, this wine will cellar nicely through 2020."
Cedar View Winery,Viognier,88.0,17.0,2,"This exceptional wine explodes in classic, characteristic aromas of rose water, dried rose petals and orange blossom, so floral and sublime. Edgy in taste, with a trace of salt, it exhibits no oak, celebrating instead an exuberance of fresh pear and grapefruit."
Cedarville,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,30.0,1,"This wine smells like moist earth after a rainfall. Aromas of earth, smoke, peat, olive tapenade and tobacco lead to abundant savory flavors with a lightly chalky feel. It captivates the senses."
Cedarville,Grenache,89.0,25.0,2,"Pale in color, this 100% Grenache has arresting, complex aromas of candied strawberries, pomegranate, herbs, plum and orange peel. The red fruit and savory flavors are sweet and generous, showing an exquisite sense of purity and richness. It's a knee-buckler but all about delicacy and restraint."
Cedarville,Petite Sirah,92.0,29.0,1,"The variety is unmistakable on this wine with its aromas of mortared fresh herbs, flowers, dry chocolate and cherry. The flavors show a mixture of lightness, intensity and richness, along with a captivating sense of texture and acidity."
Cedarville,Syrah,92.0,29.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon (65%) takes the lead on this wine followed by Merlot (15%) and equal parts Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Aromas of high-toned dried herbs, flowers, black currant, coffee and barrel spices lead to densely packed black fruit flavors that need time to strut their stuff. Drink after 2021."
Cedarville,Viognier,92.0,22.0,1,"This is a fun discovery, a tantalizing mix of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grown from estate vineyards in cool, acid-driven sites within the appellation ideal for sparkling. Light pink and gold in color, it celebrates the tangy flavors of pomegranate, strawberry and grapefruit against a mineral-laden backdrop and remarkable depth."
Cedarville,Zinfandel,89.0,25.0,1,"This joins the happily increasing ranks of Oregon Pinots under $20 that can successfully compete with entry-level bottles from New Zealand, California and Burgundy. Grounded in varietal character, it brings tart red fruits, berries, cherries and loamy earth into play; the acids are plentiful and the wine does not overreach. Flavors are true and lingering, with suggestions of gunmetal and iron ore adding interest to the finish."
Cedarville Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,30.4,5,"Part of King Estate's ambitious Limited Edition program for Pinot Gris, this is packaged in a hock bottle with a label styled for a European look. Slightly off dry, with residual sugar just below one percent, it's lovely with honey, tea, lemon cake and ripe, semitropical fruit flavors. Great focus and balance are in play, with perfect acidity."
Cedarville Vineyard,Grenache,92.0,25.0,1,"Hooray for Shea—a shining star in this difficult vintage. Give it a good sniff and note the wood smoke, cedar and bacon scents rising from the glass. Fruit flavors tumble after, a complex mix of fig, berry and black cherry, with a streak of cola. It's lively and lingering—drink now or cellar until 2024."
Cedarville Vineyard,Grenache Blend,90.0,39.0,1,"Scott Paul's largest production Pinot Noir is a nicely balanced, silky wine, fermented with wild yeasts and structured for elegance. Raspberry, black cherry, a touch of blood orange and a lick of molasses all contribute."
Cedarville Vineyard,Petite Sirah,91.6,28.6,5,"This is already rounding off nicely into mature flavors with notes of truffle, dried cherries, ginger and brown spices. Smooth and medium-bodied, it's drinking in prime condition, with finishing touches of fig and strawberry preserves."
Cedarville Vineyard,Red Blend,89.5,36.83,6,"Charred plums, roasted meat and a tinge of truffle oil lead the nose on this powerful yet balanced wine. It hits the palate with a sanguine iron flavor and a pleasant tension thanks to appropriate bitterness. This Pinot Noir can tackle the heartiest beef dish you can make."
Cedarville Vineyard,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,39.0,1,"This cuvée offers a classic mix of rose petals, black cherry and cola. It's lively, fruity and light on its feet. Delicate touches of herb, pinpoint acidity, a hint of lime and perfect balance keep it satisfying through an extended finish."
Cedarville Vineyard,Syrah,90.33,27.67,3,"This bottling is fruit-forward on the nose with aromas of black currant and black plum, but the touches of dark chocolate and roasted game provide depth. It tightens up on the sip, where the blackberry-jam elements are enhanced by vanilla and milk chocolate shavings. The tannins are present but soft, and the acidity is decent, making for a very drinkable expression."
Cedarville Vineyard,Viognier,90.75,21.0,4,"The gold color and buttery flavors give this wine a rich personality for such a low-alcohol level and for a varietal that is often crisp and light. Almost mainstream in style compared to most D&G offerings, it has vanilla, pear and almond to add complexity and a smooth broad texture that soothes the palate."
Cedarville Vineyard,Zinfandel,90.0,23.0,3,"This blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot and 5% Carmenère is fragrant, with raspberry, freshly sliced bell pepper and green herb notes. The palate is full of cocoa and chocolate flavors, leaning heavily on oak attributes but still providing appeal."
Cellars 33,Pinot Noir,92.0,46.33,3,"Straight down-the-middle aromas of red cherry, salt and pepper, vanilla and a touch of brioche show on this bottling of a clone that's related to the Brunello region. It's lighter bodied on the palate and quite easy to quaff, with light cherry and strawberry flavors riding a gravelly texture."
Cellars 33,White Blend,87.0,26.0,1,"This longtime winemaking family uses an old-style label on this bottling of the classic Italian grape, which spent 24 months on American oak. Rusty bloody aromas of cranberry, peppercorn and carnation lead into a palate framed by stiff tannins and strong acidity. Red-fruit flavors mix with woody spice, and the finish is sticky, showing that this wine is still very young."
Cellars 33,Zinfandel,90.0,36.0,2,"This is made in the somewhat austere style of a Loire valley Chinon, done well here, adding nothing harsh, bitter or unpleasant to the wine. You will also find soft plum and cherry fruit, modest but perfectly ripe and proportionate, rounding out the midpalate."
Cenay,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,40.0,1,"Deliciously bright and spicy, its cranberry and raspberry fruit is highlighted with pepper and cinnamon. With more breathing time it fleshes out, fills in with pretty pie cherry flavors and some pleasing toastiness."
Cenay,Chardonnay,93.0,35.0,1,"Lemberger was planted here in the 1970s, and Kiona still carries the torch for the grape. Earthy, gamy, soft and smooth, it has a quickly maturing flavor set, built upon chocolate and cherries, with dusty tannins."
Cenay,Pinot Noir,84.0,35.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot combine harmoniously in this concentrated, structured and brooding red wine. It's wrapped in black fruit, black tea and herb tones, with a little clove flirting above the fray. The tannins are dry."
Cent'Anni,Sangiovese,92.67,44.0,3,"This Bordeaux-style blend of 25% Merlot, 25% Malbec, 25% Cabernet Franc, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Petit Verdot greets the nose with purple fruits, cigar box and menthol. The soft palate is saturated with blackberry pie and peppery spice, presented with nicely chalky tannins."
Cent'Anni,White Blend,91.0,32.0,2,"Lush in brambly blackberry, this classic Zinfandel comes from a cooler area than usual, the Russian River Valley, which manages to retain small plantings of the variety amid the larger seas of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Spicy, the wine is balanced and fairly elegant, medium in body and weight while still packing a punch."
Center of Effort,Chardonnay,91.67,26.0,3,"From the rocky Stagecoach Vineyard atop Atlas Peak, this Cabernet is hearty in tannins and built to age through 2020, the dense black berry and cherry fruit flavors needing time to mature. For now, the wine's character is all savory and leathery, with tight tannins."
Center of Effort,Pinot Noir,89.6,26.2,5,"Leather, smashed berries and juniper reveal the age of this wine, further enhanced with a meaty mouthfeel, redolent with flavors of blueberry and purple fruits. Charred vanilla touches on the finish."
Central Coast Group Project,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,75.0,1,"All the Brick House wines are certified organic and Biodynamic. Les Dijonnais spent 15 months in 30% new French oak. The opening aromas lead with fresh, lively, buoyant notes of cherry fruit. With more exposure to air its tannins get a bit chewy, and the wine shows impressive strength through a long finish."
Central Coast Group Project,Syrah,93.0,75.0,1,"Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose. Once sipped, a rainbow of dark flavors emerges: chopped Italian herbs, creosote, black olive, fennel, soy and orange pith, reminiscent of a North African tagine."
Cenyth,Cabernet Franc,91.0,25.0,1,"One of the many vintners proud of their forthcoming Willow Creek District appellation, Bob and Jo-Ann Dunning's Chardonnay presents delicate aromas of yellow flowers, vanilla bean, peach skin and limestone. The white rocks extend to the palate, picking up nectarine elements, too, creating a lean but flavorful wine that's refreshing enough to sip all night."
Cerridwen,Abouriou,85.0,75.0,1,"The winery makes this wine from vines planted in 1959 that it now farms organically. In this vintage, they produced a hearty, sizable wine, ripe, soft and intense, in need of time to coax the blackberry and cassis fruit forward. Enjoy through 2025."
Cerro Prieto,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,69.0,1,"Bold flavors and a graceful mouthfeel come together in this classic, complex and well-balanced red, made from 71% Zinfandel with other traditional California varieties. The blackberry, sage and ever-so-slightly earthy aromas continue through the flavors, where they interlace with firm tannins and supportive acidity. This could easily improve through 2019."
Cerro Prieto,Pinot Noir,93.0,42.0,1,"Pleasantly dank aromas of smoldering pine needles, leather and gamy meats hit the nose on this 2% Viognier coferment. Flavors are reminiscent of roasted wild boar, with dark chocolate, creosote and beef crust, presented against grippy tannins."
Cerro Prieto,Syrah,93.0,59.0,1,"From the Napa side of Carneros, this small-production Pinot is concentrated and oaky, layered throughout in spicy black cherry tart. The strong flavors lead to a strong, emphatic finish."
Cerulean,Pinot Gris,91.0,25.0,1,"Extra time in bottle has proved rewarding for this varietally pure, aromatic, even pungent wine. A complex bouquet yields rose petals, sweet spices, coffee and cedar, and flavors follow through a subtle, penetrating finish. The spicy, brambly berry fruit carries a hint of brine. Drink now through 2025."
Cerulean,Red Blend,88.0,25.0,2,"There's meaty leather and sizable tannin in this mountain-grown Malbec, from an Atlas Peak vineyard sought after for many types of red grapes. Time in bottle has served it well, the bolder aspects and jammy blackberry and blueberry fruit softened by balanced acidity."
Cerulean,Riesling,88.0,25.0,1,"This private reserve is 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot, aged considerably in bottle. Rich and full-bodied, it has a vanilla-kissed nose and earthy leather pedigree, the black cherry flavor concentrated and thick."
Cerulean,Tempranillo,85.0,30.0,1,"Baked vanilla cake, marcona almonds and pressed guava notes make for a balanced though certainly oaken nose from the appellation's pioneering property. The flavors are round and peachy, with a nice arc of smoke and butter that lead to bitter mustard and acidic zing on the finish."
Cerulean,White Blend,87.0,25.0,1,"This blend of 43% Syrah, 31% Mourvèdre, 23%  Grenache and 3% Alicante Bouschet opens with an elegant and nuanced nose, featuring scents of blackberry crumble, lilac and other purple flowers. The tart, earthy flavors combine black raspberry and vanilla with beet root, black earth and sagebrush. A deep, heady blend."
Ch.igai Takaha,Chardonnay,94.0,58.0,1,"Wildly complex aromas show on this blend of 72% Grenache, 16% Mourvèdre, 10% Tempranillo and 2% Alicante Bouschet. Ripe raspberry and eucalyptus run into notes of soy sauce and dried lilac. Flavors lean toward purple fruit and ripe raspberry, with bergamot and pencil lead working their way in as well."
Ch.igai Takaha,Pinot Noir,93.0,68.0,2,"Joe Barton, who's made Grey Wolf wines since 1994, launched this brand inspired by pop songs in 2011. This Counting Crows ode delivers aromas of raspberry-laced black tea, clove and cardamom. It's soft and inviting on the palate, with anise, mocha and blackberry flavors that finish with a wash of tobacco. It was still quite tight after hours of being opened, perhaps due to the 35% whole cluster maceration. Drink 2017–2023."
Chacewater,Merlot,90.0,22.0,1,"There's a dynamic range of aromas on this wine, from dark blackberry fruit to sassafras, anise, eucalyptus, coffee and earthy loam. It's rich with nicely chalky tannins on the palate, with flavors of cooked black cherry, black tea and licorice."
Chacewater,Red Blend,86.75,24.25,4,"A heavily spiced nose of cracked peppercorn and tobacco notes mesh with blackberry extract and blueberries on this top bottling from the winery. Its flavors are even darker than blue fruit, with creosote and smoked cigar elements that mellow and evolve as the bottle sits open."
Chacewater,Rosé,87.0,17.0,1,"At the moment the pleasant fruit seems completely overmatched by the heavily charred, smoky barrel flavors. Even after substantial breathing time the fruit failed to fill out, and the finish turned a bit watery and slightly bitter."
Chacewater,Syrah,91.0,21.0,2,"This wine opens with the fresh liveliness of stemmy earth and black tea notes, growing funkier and more herbal on the midpalate. Brightly layered and deeply flavored, it's a full-bodied rendition that remains true to its variety."
Chacewater,Zinfandel,92.0,29.33,3,"This is a vibrant take on the grape, with fresh-pressed boysenberry and wisteria aromas merging with rosemary, fennel and sarsaparilla on the nose. Food friendly, it shows more boysenberry, thyme, white pepper, and floral freshness on the palate."
Chaleur Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,125.0,1,"Sweet cedar aromas kick off this attention-grabbing bottling, with elderberry and black plum scents combining for an Old World feel in which the structure can be sensed on sniff alone. Wood and graphite notes pop on the palate, where a loamy riverstone minerality courses through black currant flavors, finishing on chocolate cake."
Chaleur Estate,White Blend,92.0,35.0,1,"Dark in the glass, this blend of 75% Grenache and 25% Syrah is rich and appealing, made in the typical Paso style. Vanilla, cola, spice cake and black cherry aromas lead to a palate laden with milk chocolate, more black cherry, and star anise flavors. The tannins are soft and lush."
Chalk Hill,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,85.0,2,"Savory pepper and grilled beef aromas make this wine appetizing, its rich berry and ripe plum flavors bringing excellent concentration and depth to the palate. It's big and bold, yet polished. Firm tannins interlacing with ripeness and spiciness to keep it balanced and help propel a lingering finish."
Chalk Hill,Chardonnay,90.0,62.4,5,"A pretty soft-focus wine, this opens gracefully with cherry lollipop fruit, accented with chocolate-coated orange peel. It's smooth, almost silky, showing just a hint of the granitic minerality that typifies this AVA. The wine spent 10 months in 42% new oak."
Chalk Hill,Pinot Gris,87.0,30.0,1,"Light and earthy, this wine glows in spicy citrus, with a rhubarb-and-strawberry tartness and black tea accents. Medium-bodied, it shows an underlying crispness that belies its weight and depth, the oak subtle yet supportive."
Chalk Hill,Pinot Noir,89.5,54.0,2,"Made from 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 8% Cabernet Franc, this wine shows a rich, full-bodied and juicy core of soft, baked plum, cherry and vanilla flavors, with a lingering streak of cinnamon. Not a vineyard designate, this is rather a selection of complementary wine lots and barrels."
Chalk Hill,Red Blend,90.33,72.5,6,"Earthy in anise and blue fruit, this wine is inexplicably crisp and plush at the same time, showing the allure of the variety in its rose petal aromas. Medium bodied and velvety, it follows through in cassis and pomegranate flavors."
Chalk Hill,Sauvignon Blanc,89.6,37.8,5,"Its prime location near Archery Summit and Domaine Drouhin marks Nysa as one of Oregon's most sought-after fruit sources. Mark McNeilly (of Mark Ryan Winery) has chosen it for one of two vineyard designates for this new project. Sweet baking spices and raspberry jam are the hallmarks here, offering immediate appeal, while retaining the structure to age for another decade. Aim for an optimal drinking window from 2019 through 2024."
Chalk Hill,Syrah,88.0,60.0,1,"Light in color, this bottling from a famous vineyard shows red cherry, crushed clove and woody herb notes on a nose that's both sanguine and sharp with anise spice. The palate is lively and spicy, with energetic white sage and bright red fruit leading into a long-lasting, menthol-laced finish."
Chalk Hill,Sémillon,90.0,45.0,1,"In 2014 this vineyard designate was further subdivided by clone. The Pommard bottling pushes big fruit front and center—a juicy mix of blood orange, red berries and cherries. There's a certain stiffness to the tannins still, but overall it's finely proportioned and should be enjoyable through the mid-2020s."
Chalk Hill,Zinfandel,88.0,42.0,1,"Nutty and lush with layers of peach, pear and lime fruit, this is a medium-bodied and well-balanced white. It's refreshing while offering both length and breadth on the palate."
Challen,Pinot Noir,91.64,57.0,11,"This wine is lifted by vibrant acidity and shows bread-like aromas accented with wild strawberry, compost and forest floor flavors. Light-bodied and fresh on the palate, it's nicely crafted and table-ready."
Challenger Ridge,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,49.0,1,"Fiesta is the lightest, most fruit forward of the four different Tempranillos from Abacela. In a great year such as this, it's also substantial and authoritative, with deeply driven flavors of red and blueberry fruit, a whiff of oak and slightly grainy tannins. This wine clearly over-delivers for the price."
Challenger Ridge,Syrah,84.0,25.0,1,"Barbecue smoke is prevalent both on the nose and palate, a characteristic that lays atop supple tannins and oak. This wine has a powerful bite of bitterness on the lean, herbal finish."
Chalone,Chardonnay,89.0,30.0,2,"Velvety texture underlies dusty tannins and neutral oak in this light and lean wine from a vineyard in the heart of Pinot Noir country. Vanilla and cherry play off each other nicely, finding equal partnership with a buoyant acidity."
Chalone,Grenache,89.75,26.25,4,"Sweet-leaning red berries meet with touches of cinnamon and vanilla on the nose of this affordably priced wine. There is decent acidic zest on the palate, which frames the tart cranberry and dark strawberry fruit and is leveled by pencil-lead flavors. It's fairly simplistic overall."
Chalone,Syrah,92.0,30.0,1,"Boysenberry, violets and a touch of bacon fat show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard on Paso's Eastside. The palate is upright in both tannins and searing acidity, with flavors of tart blueberry and black peppercorn."
Chalone Vineyard,Chardonnay,92.0,30.0,1,"Pear blossom, baked lemons, packed lemon flowers, apple juice, walnut and a touch of quinine pop on the nose of this wine from a challenging grape. The palate is rich but zesty with walnut oil, chamomile, lime, apple and pear notes, offering lots of textural intrigue."
Chalone Vineyard,Chenin Blanc,92.0,25.0,1,"This is a light, clear and candied wine, somewhat thin, that's also tangy in acidity. Also holding 5% Zinfandel and 5% Sangiovese, it's definitely fruity in cherry and vanilla without getting overripe, a good value made by longtime winemaker Dr. Richard Peterson."
Chalone Vineyard,Pinot Blanc,91.0,20.0,2,"Fresh-flowing blood, dried Italian herbs and cured cuts of meat greet the nose on this annual Bonny Doon treat, a blend of 28% Syrah, 22% Grenache, 17% Cinsault, 17% Mourvèdre and 16% Carignane. The flavors are dominated by purple fruits, trending toward blackberry and blueberry, with violet florals and rustic dust."
Chalone Vineyard,Pinot Noir,92.0,37.5,2,"From Olsen vineyard grapes, this is brawny, ripe, dark and oaky—what else would you expect? It's a take-no-prisoners red that is loaded with spicy blackberry fruit. Tannins are ripe and in proportion, and the fruit has that notable lift from vivid acidity that sets Washington reds apart."
Chamisal Vineyards,Chardonnay,90.33,38.33,12,"A blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah all aged in neutral oak, it's jazzy and appealing with notes of blue fruit, raspberry, smoked meat and peppery spices showing good purity and richness. It's nowhere near as weighty as the labeled alcohol level might suggest."
Chamisal Vineyards,Grenache,91.67,51.0,3,"This wine features inviting aromatics of fresh plum, coconut and strawberry. The palate entices with savory rhubarb, bay leaf, mint and cola. A tight core of structure partners with soft, plush tannins."
Chamisal Vineyards,Pinot Noir,91.88,62.5,8,"Ridge's historic Monte Bello estate produces black tobacco, wet slate, chalk and blueberry jam aromas in this vintage. The wine, which gets support from 14% Merlot-3% Petite Verdot-1% Cabernet Franc, is not very dense and even racy on the palate, with violet, cola, tart cranberry and darker fruit as well."
Chamisal Vineyards,Syrah,93.5,48.0,2,"Adam Lee's take on this vineyard on the eastern border of the Sta. Rita Hills is rich with tomato, cinnamon, sour cherry and tart blackberry aromas. It's soft and velvety once sipped, with cranberry juice flavors and cola making for a fun yet approachable Pinot Noir, easy to drink but able to trigger deep thoughts as well."
Champy,Sparkling Blend,89.0,20.0,1,"Brisk freshness characterizes this Pinot from Richard Sanford, a pioneer in the region. The wine presents violet and elderberry on the nose and is soft yet extra-expressive once sipped, with mocha, strawberry, black tea, and, on the edges, a grapefruit peel bitterness."
Chandler Reach,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.5,27.5,2,"There's a bit more fruit—cherry, cranberry—and no dust to this Cigare compared to other Bonny Doon bottlings, but blacker aromas of asphalt and char persist. The blend of 36% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 19% Cinsault delivers strong tannins and flavors of a black-and-blue filet mignon topped with a wild berry reduction sauce"
Chandler Reach,Cabernet Franc,92.0,38.0,1,"Charred meat, blood, concrete and elderberry form a deep and complex nose. The fine-grained tannins deliver gamy, blackberry flavors, making for a very solid wine that's a steal of a deal."
Chandler Reach,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,42.0,1,"This Pinot Noir project from the Napa Valley's Hall family starts with dense and inky core aromas of ripe raspberry and black tea, with a touch of vanilla. Once sipped, the flavors verge toward black cherry and blackberry, with very liqueur-like chocolate and a pronounced and lasting spice element."
Chandler Reach,Red Blend,87.67,15.33,3,"Despite the name, this is the value offering, not the reserve, from Soléna. Young, tart and tight, it displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids. Holding until 2016–2017 may help to smooth it out, but it's perfectly delightful already."
Chandler Reach,Rhône-style Red Blend,86.0,28.0,1,"Sweet-seeming aromas and flavors dominate this full-bodied, ripe-tasting wine—not unusual for a Rhône-style blend that leads with  Grenache. A spicy, smoky influence is delicious in its own right, but has a tasty component of fresh blackberry and boysenberry to back it up."
Chandler Reach,Rosé,86.0,14.0,1,"Slightly oxidized aromas of marzipan, pressed yellow flowers, dried lemon rinds and apricot cream entice the nose on this wine from the historic vineyard by Joshua Klapper. The palate shows woody spice and a unique iodine character, with cinnamon, salt, sour yeastiness and a touch of tart citrus peel."
Chandler Reach,Sangiovese,90.0,38.0,1,"Remarkably strong cinnamon characterizes the nose of this old-vine wine, which also shows red and black cherries, potpourri and gingerbread on the nose. Black raspberries, cranberry-pomegranate juice, dark chocolate, purple flowers, black pepper and cardamom entertain the palate, which also offers decent acidity and grip, but finishes quickly."
Chandler Reach,Syrah,90.0,28.0,1,"Full bodied and bold flavored, this is not overwhelmingly dark in color nor pumped up in ripeness. It does emphasize aromas of anise and dried plums, adding flavors of blackberrry juice and a sense of alcoholic strength. It is moderately tannic, while the texture is mouthfilling and the finish rather warm."
Chandler Reach,Viognier,90.0,27.0,1,"This is a 100% estate wine from the producer's cool-climate sites near the town of Freestone. Black pepper and a nutty entry invite one in to explore further, this wine having many stories to tell as it develops. Soft and mellow, it's also feral and funky, with a strong essence of mushroomy forest floor."
Chandon,Sparkling Blend,88.93,31.14,14,"This is a beautiful and beguiling wine, so different from many of its counterparts in its sizzling, citrus-driven acidity and persistent freshness. Tangerine and grapefruit are the stars, unexpectedly keeping this light-bodied vineyard-designate alive and inviting on the palate."
Chanin,Chardonnay,93.83,40.5,6,"Bright, fresh and vivacious, this bottling from the historic vineyard offers white flowers, sea salt, lemons and buttered white peaches on the nose. Apple flesh and lime rind sizzles into the citrus-driven palate, where a touch of lemon verbena adds complexity to this straightforward and delicious wine."
Chanin,Pinot Noir,93.64,51.82,11,"It's the stem inclusion that shows itself first, with aromas of olive and herb in front of violets, red fruit, pepper, earth and whiffs of coffee and smoked meat. The flavors are reserved, supple and polished, with bright acids keeping it all in focus. It demands food alongside it to be properly appreciated."
Channing Daughters,Chardonnay,84.0,13.0,1,"Black cherries, leather, dried rose petals, rustic cinnamon, bloody meat, graphite, cherry cola and vanilla bean show on the wondrously layered nose of this Steve Clifton bottling. It's still a tad young on the palate, which is grippy with sticky tannins, but shows cola, brown spice, cinnamon, cardamom cream, tart plum fruit and a lasting dried mint element. Drink 2018 through 2028."
Channing Daughters,Merlot,83.0,19.0,1,"This is a Westside Road site known for its rocky soils, and the wine presents sassafras, cherry-berry and roses on the entry before laying down a tightly woven mix of sour, salty cranberry and blood orange. It is softly voluptuous and velvety, though young, with a biting chewiness that should mellow in the cellar. Drink now through 2028."
Channing Daughters,Red Blend,84.0,15.0,1,"A larger offering from the producer from a selection of sites, this shows a prowess of blending in its grippy, classic elements of black pepper and currant, a focused display of savory edges around elusive fruit that makes for a compelling experience. Drink now through 2023."
Channing Perrine,Cabernet Sauvignon,82.0,19.0,1,"Red cherry, vanilla, chaparral scrub and cranberry puree show on the nose of this bottling from the longtime estate, and then come the intriguing olive and Middle Eastern spices. The palate hones in on that Mediterranean spice character, with Kalamata olives blending into lavender, exotic mulberry and thyme-laced cherry-plum sauce."
Channing Perrine,Merlot,83.0,16.0,1,"Dark golden in color, this celebration of the Chinese zodiac opens with fresh-squeezed lemon and saline, a a saltiness that's inviting and imaginative. Medium in body, this is fleshy, juicy and bright, a complement of ripe apple and banana, a perfumed floral quality and spicy minerality."
Channing Perrine,Riesling,83.0,13.0,1,"From vines averaging 95 years old, this is an impressive effort, in balance between savory, sultry overtones of peppercorn and espresso and a riper, juicier core of blackberry. Supportive acidity provides a freshness to the wine, which offers plenty of length and breadth on the finish."
Chappellet,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.67,112.0,3,"Elegant and silky on the nose, this bottling shows aromas of pressed violet, rose bud, grape candy, cherry blossom and lilac. There is a lot of cinnamon and star anise spice on the palate as well as a strong touch of licorice that's laid across deep olallieberry fruit and a lavender florality."
Chappellet,Chenin Blanc,93.0,32.0,2,"Another tiny production, made in a different style from many of the other designates released by the producer this year, Ten Oaks is named for the, yes, 10 trees bordering the vineyard. Medium in tannin and oak, with a surprising lightness of being, it shows a citrus-like quality that makes it refreshing, while a sublime texture keeps rolling along the tongue."
Charbay,Port,93.5,62.5,2,"The aromas of embers, black pepper, dark fruit, herbs, smoke and spice are brooding and locked up on first pour, showing more on each swirl. The blue and black-fruit flavors are ripe, sweet and full, with savory notes fleshing out the crazy long finish."
Chardenet,Chardonnay,90.67,58.33,3,"Floral, citrus aromas, honeylike flavors and an unctuous texture make this white Rhône-style blend almost a dessert in a glass—without being sweet. The wine is full bodied, mouthfilling, complex and gushing with great pastry-like flavors."
Charles & Charles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,14.0,1,"There's an immediate pithy tension on the nose of this bottling from a producer in the game since 1933, with Brie-cheese rind, fresh Greek yogurt and and grapefruit-peel aromas. The flavors are intriguing, hard to pin down and alluring, with exotic citrus and varied stone fruit, light honeysuckle and crushed slate mixed with chalky structure. Simmering acidity keeps the flavors coming."
Charles & Charles,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,89.0,13.33,3,"Light and delicate aromas of lime curd, vanilla yogurt and a touch of pear custard show in a very pleasing manner on the nose of this vineyard-blend bottling. The palate is expertly rounded, with wet riverstone, yellow apple, lime zest and creamy white fruit like cherimoya and ripe nectarine."
Charles & Charles,Riesling,90.0,14.0,1,"Aromas of green herbs, flowers, earth and mineral start out quite brooding. The smoked meat and savory flavors are very pretty, showing a light touch. The finish lingers."
Charles B. Mitchell,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,48.0,1,"Baked red plum, black cherry, sagebrush, graphite and budding hibiscus aromas show on the rich and minerally nose of this bottling. The palate is very inviting and lavish, with pungent dark red fruits of cherry and black plum enhanced by allspice, ginger and black pepper."
Charles B. Mitchell,Merlot,85.0,24.0,1,"Typically the most forward of the winery's offerings, this wine brings aromas of blue fruit along with notes of fire pit, olive, mineral and cured meat that become more prominent over time. The blue and black-fruit flavors are dense and focused, with a firm backbone of tannins providing support. It needs time in the cellar to stretch its legs."
Charles B. Mitchell,Red Blend,83.0,18.0,1,"The white-pepper, garrigue, raspberry, orange-peel and pot-roast aromas pop. The palate is action packed with raspberry and cranberry flavors that lead to a long, savory finish."
Charles B. Mitchell,Sangiovese,85.0,27.0,1,"Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (74%) with the balance Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this wine starts out brooding, with aromas of coffee, spice, vanilla, plum, dark fruit and high-toned herbs. The cherry and barrel spice flavors coat the palate, backed by firm tannins that need time to soften."
Charles B. Mitchell,Zinfandel,88.0,23.25,4,"Pan-seared apple flesh, light jasmine, white lily, chamomile, lemongrass and sandstone aromas show on the delicate nose of this bottling from an increasingly popular vineyard in the foothills east of Salinas. Very stony and pithy flavors show once sipped, with crisp nectarine, heirloom apples, Asian pear, a slice of riper pineapple and sea-salt flavors."
Charles Heintz,Chardonnay,91.0,45.0,2,"This notable Gewürtz starts with an aromatic, fresh fruit nose—melon, flowers—tinged with spice. On the palate, the wine offers an elegant array of white fruit, citrus and spice flavors and a shot of balancing acidity. The wine offers complexity but is also fun and refreshing, not perfumy or heavy."
Charles Heintz,Pinot Noir,92.0,19.0,2,"Pine and herb and green apple scents introduce this sharply defined wine, with crisp acidity and bright fruit flavors. It's tight and juicy, an excellent companion to creamy dishes or soft cheeses."
Charles Krug,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,60.0,1,"Plump blackberries and ready-to-pop cherries are laced with touches of fresh tobacco, graphite and turned earth on this very well done Cab. The rich black plum fruit of the palate is cut by a strong acidity and firm tannic grip, with flavors of pencil lead keeping the wine serious and driven."
Charles Krug,Cabernet Blend,85.0,60.0,1,"This wine gives a big bear hug with aromas like wild berries and black pepper. Then sweet oak and rich, savory plum flavors emerge on the palate as the ripeness comes through. The finish is long and reverberates with the nutmeg spiciness of perfectly seasoned barrels."
Charles Krug,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.4,87.5,10,"Imposing, concentrated and tannic, this Syrah-based blend needs time to mature and soften. It has vivid aromas and flavors of black pepper, clove, cranberry and dark chocolate plus an almost rigid mouthfeel from a thick underpinning of fine tannins. The distinctive flavors match the powerful structure, so it should age well. Best to drink after 2020."
Charles Krug,Malbec,88.0,65.0,1,"This is an earthy, ethereal, lighter-bodied wine. It's satisfyingly varietal and shines in blue fruit, sarsaparilla, strawberry hulls and touches of a forest floor's trove of mushrooms. Well-hewn acidity gives it a freshness and structure with a background of firm tannin."
Charles Krug,Merlot,88.0,25.0,1,"A very ripe, sweet boysenberry aroma sets the tone for this very full-bodied, fruit-drenched wine. It fairly oozes blackberry flavors, feels rich and broad on the palate and has a firm but not very tannic texture. It's easy to enjoy this exuberant wine now through 2023."
Charles Krug,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,35.0,1,"Outcrop was planted in 1982. A hint of leather (not too much) along with scents of sassafras and crushed roses, open into a peppery palate with cranberries and red fruits. Ample acidity carries it into a penetrating finish. Drink 2020 through 2035 and beyond."
Charles Smith,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.5,20.0,4,"An abundance of fresh fruit spills out of this full-bodied, pure and uncomplicated wine in a way that's hard to resist. There is little obvious oak to get in the way of flavors like vine-ripened raspberries and blackberries as they stream along on fine tannins and lithe acidity."
Charles Smith,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,95.5,100.0,2,"It's amazing how this super-concentrated wine smells like chocolate cherries and tastes almost like blackberry syrup, yet it's nice and dry in style. A firm coating of fine tannins gives grip on the tongue and seems to extend the juicy fruit and dark chocolate notes on the finish."
Charles Smith,Chardonnay,88.0,12.5,2,"From a warm site in a warm year and entirely varietal, there's much to impress in this wine, from its full-bodied, bold structure to its velvety texture. In between cranberry and pomegranate offer a freshness of flavor, bringing out further acidity before cocoa powder, tar and black cherry take over."
Charles Smith,Malbec,92.0,70.0,3,"Sultry blackberry, tobacco leaf, caramel and black pepper spice show on the nose of this well-integrated, brooding but fresh nose. The palate is rich, flavorful and vivacious, with lilac, lavender, boysenberry and olallieberry deepening into tar, char and smoked meats."
Charles Smith,Merlot,88.67,12.33,3,This limited block selection comes from own-rooted vines planted in 1979. Full-fruited flavors combine into a fresh and lush mix of berries and cherries with a citrusy kick. There's a tropical punch sensibility combined with the texture and depth of a very fine Pinot. The tannins are polished and in perfect proportion.
Charles Smith,Riesling,90.0,12.0,3,"New management, farming and winemaking practices at this producer, including a focus on smaller production, are remarkably on display in this delicious white. Golden pear and crunchy apple provide an unctuous, delightfully balanced experience that's crisp in underlying acidity and subtle baking spice."
Charles Smith,Syrah,93.75,85.12,8,"Exuberant in mousse, this wine is luxurious and rich, the perfect quaff for any occasion. Made from 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay, and aged for three years, it's bright in bolts of green apple and strawberry."
Charles Smith,Viognier,93.0,40.0,3,"This varietal wine is toasty in caramelized oak and richly interwoven with flavors and aromas of pencil shavings, plum and black currant. Grippy, with a velvety texture, it provides structure and power in equal parts."
Chasseur,Chardonnay,89.5,60.0,2,"From older vines planted on the producer's estate Quail Hill Vineyard, this wine is thickly concentrated, with a generosity of oak. Creamy, intense and well made, it features complex layers of golden apple, butter and lemon bar."
Chasseur,Pinot Noir,88.33,60.0,3,"This is a highly perfumed and floral wine from the famous site, which is tangy and slightly tart within a medium-bodied frame. Lemon and baked apple play off each other with ease, as a metallic edge of stony minerality persists and expands."
Chateau Lafayette Reneau,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,55.0,2,"A blend of the favorite grapes of winemaker Edgar Torres (60% Grenache) and his wife, Erika (40% Syrah) from Kimsey Vineyard, this bottling shows bright and elegant aromas of boysenberry and elderberry with olive, wet river stone and pine forest. The chalky tannins still need time to evolve, but the black pepper, dark fruit, incense and myrrh flavors are well balanced."
Chateau Lafayette Reneau,Chardonnay,84.0,17.5,2,"Fresh and easy aromas of raspberry, plum candy, dark rose petals, boysenberry and allspice show on the nose of this clonal study. The palate blends big, joyous purple fruit and grippy tannic tension, also presenting lavender and Sichuan peppercorn tones."
Chateau Lettau,Pinot Noir,90.0,45.0,2,"This is a wildly exotic wine, vibrantly abuzz in cranberry, pomegranate and rhubarb, a side note of barnyard-like earth and pretty rose petal. Tight-grained acidity remains firm in the glass and supportive of a grittiness of texture, notes of clove and black tea spiked throughout."
Chateau Lettau,Red Blend,89.0,45.0,1,"Plenty of fresh purple flowers, from violets to lilacs, show on the nose of this bottling, as well as cola spice and a strong core of blueberry fruit. It's lightweight but well structured on the palate, where rose hips, lavender, fennel fronds and tarragon meet with boysenberry and light elderberry. This is still very fresh and young."
Chateau Margene,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.0,150.0,1,"Made from a majority of Pinot Noir, this reserve-tier wine lives up to its label, showing a dry swath of wild strawberry and orange preserve among a creamy center of integrated acidity and depth. It's a delight with complexity and crispness working well together."
Chateau Margene,Cabernet Franc,91.0,69.33,3,"This perennial favorite lives up to its word-of-mouth goodness, offering fistfuls of blueberry and huckleberry with a juicy length and throughput of acidity. Soft and strong, it's supple, floral and memorable in its deliciousness."
Chateau Margene,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.4,79.8,5,"This Syrah, which is enhanced by 15% Petit Verdot, is one of the better wines from the region on the market for less than $25. Awesome aromas of pepper, blackberry and charred beef are intense and deep, while the palate is lifted by bountiful acidity and flavors of boysenberry, white, black and green peppercorns, incense and sagebrush."
Chateau Molyneaux,Pinot Blanc,86.0,24.0,1,"This bottling from Santa Barbara County's oldest Syrah planting is always like tasting history. Aromas of roasted coffee beans and charred wood meet with pressed blackberry, vanilla and caramel on the nose. The palate combines tart black-plum skins with charred meat, more roasted coffee and lots of cocoa dust, with riper hints of fig and blueberry fruit arising toward the finish."
Chateau Montelena,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,160.0,1,"A 100% varietal, site-specific wine from the heart of the appellation, this succeeds in a herbal persistence and lean nose. Red currant, cassis and anise wrap around thick tannins, with lingering notes of clove and cedar."
Chateau Rollat,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,29.0,1,"Made entirely from Chardonnay, this is a bright sparkling wine, bubbling in acidity and dry, leavened layers of apple and pear. A creaminess of vanilla balances the crispness, making for a successful small-production sparkler."
Chateau Rollat,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.29,45.86,7,"From a high desert vineyard in the Cuyama Valley area, this bottling impresses with structure and earthy minerality. Aromas of black rocks, loamy soils and beef crust meet with shreds of elderberry and black plum on the nose. The palate's sticky tannins are persistent but pleasant, carrying flavors of dried blueberry, savory charred meats and a touch of lilac and rose petal."
Chateau Rollat,Red Blend,89.0,29.0,1,"The blend of 55% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 16% Mourvèdre and 4% Cinsaut offers subtle mulberry fruit on the nose, a spicy peppercorn kick and plenty of gamy meats. That funky meat quality, from raw to jerkied, is prominent and pure on the sip, surrounded by exotic plums and Middle Eastern spices."
Chateau St. Jean,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,80.0,1,"There's a compellingly nutty warmth to the nose of this reserve blend of 66% Grenache Blanc and 34% Roussanne, with pecan and cashew aromas as well as more tart scents of key lime peels and lemon mousse. It lands heavily on the palate with roasted banana flavors and a buttery midpalate, but it is cut immediately by a kumquat tartness. Fascinating sipper."
Chateau St. Jean,Chardonnay,89.33,23.33,3,"An aromatically reserved wine with notes of apple and melon. It's medium bodied and drinks dry, losing some of its concentration in the middle."
Chateau St. Jean,Fumé Blanc,88.0,22.0,2,"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this is aromatic, with notes of ripe peach, melon and honeysuckle. It's full bodied, somewhat viscous in feel, carrying considerable alcoholic warmth."
Chateau St. Jean,Pinot Noir,87.0,25.0,1,"Earthy and recalling the aromas of a woodshed or old barn, this tastes of darker fruit. Relatively lean on the palate, it ends as abruptly as it starts."
Chateau Ste. Michelle,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,61.67,3,"This is 100% Riesling, but with less than half the residual sugar of the winery's 2011 vintage. Sourced from the Evergreen Vineyard in the up-and-coming Ancient Lakes AVA, it has great acidity and purity of fruit, along with the minerality for which the region is known. Dense flavors of lime, grapefruit and pineapple are at the core of this wonderfully concentrated, expressive Riesling."
Chateau Ste. Michelle,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.12,27.6,25,"The No Girls Grenache, from a vineyard adjacent to Armada (the source for the Cayuse God Only Knows Grenache) is lighter, more elegant, perhaps brighter than its companion wine, with fresh blueberry and other pie berry  fruits, a streak of umami, herbal tea and impressive minerality. Almost Burgundian in style, it possesses excellent length and wonderful texture."
Chateau Ste. Michelle,Chardonnay,89.24,23.29,34,"The 2010 Widowmaker shows a bit more fruit, less funk than usual. It's a pleasing mix of berries, cherries, plums and figs, along with clean earth, green tea and a hint of chocolate. The tannins are smooth and the flavors linger gracefully and slowly fade through the finish."
Chateau Ste. Michelle,Meritage,91.0,60.5,4,"Powerful scents of black olive, brine, seaweed and umami introduce this classic Syrah from the heart of what's known as The Rocks District in Walla Walla. The flavors are a complex mix of iron, rock, saline minerality and crushed raspberries. The No Girls project is distinct from Cayuse, sourced exclusively from the La Paciencia Vineyard, and provides a showcase for wines with elegant aromatics, great balance, length and complexity."
Chateau Ste. Michelle,Merlot,88.78,26.04,27,"There's a heaviness to this 76% Cab blended with 7% Petit Verdot, 6% Merlot, 6% Cab Franc and 5% Malbec. A muscular, powerful wine, it's intense in hay and herb, the finish veering savory to the point of sour."
Chateau Ste. Michelle,Red Blend,86.5,28.5,4,"Ripe aromas of blueberry, acai fruit and grape candy get touched by smoked meat, crushed herbs and a slight mint. Leather and tar flavors emerge on the palate, but the fruits and spice characteristics are wound up in incredibly firm, mouth-drying tannins, which are overwhelming right now."
Chateau Ste. Michelle,Riesling,89.1,16.35,20,"This aromatically unusual wine features notes of peppermint, honeycomb and apricot. It's front loaded in feel, pulling up short on the back half."
Chateau Ste. Michelle,Sauvignon Blanc,88.5,15.5,8,"Funky and feral, this is a dark, bacon-y Pinot that's alive on the palate, swarmed by silky tannins, the tension between oak and fruit resolved."
Chateau Ste. Michelle,Syrah,88.8,40.0,5,"Coming from a cool vintage, this shows notes of green herbs, vanilla and black cherry. It's somewhat lean in feel with puckering acids and chalky tannins."
Chateau Ste. Michelle,Sémillon,90.0,23.0,1,"Equal parts Syrah and Merlot with a dash of Mourvèdre and Cabernet Franc (3% each), this wine brings notes of biscuit, cherry, dill and dried cranberry. Like many wines from this vintage in Washington, it's quite tart out of the gate, supported by chewy tannins."
Chateau Ste. Michelle,White Blend,90.0,45.0,1,"Surprisingly shy in aromas at first, this eventually releases pleasing elements of mace, nutmeg, star anise and red cherry. The palate is softly lush and earthy, with black rocks, heavy black plum, hoisin sauce, boysenberry and a cola character. With quite strong structure, this will smooth and grow more delicious with time. Drink 2018–2028."
Chateau Ste. Michelle,White Riesling,96.0,40.0,1,"One of the most beautiful package designs in the state introduces a fresh and toasty wine that translates this cool, wet vintage into a most delicate and enjoyable bottle of Pinot. Light cranberry and cherry fruit is set in a gently proportional bed of tart acid and pretty oak, 40% new."
Chateau Ste. Michelle & Dr. Loosen,Riesling,91.71,51.71,7,"Firm and polished, this barrel-fermented wine is just rounded off enough, without damping the bright, almost crunchy fruit. There's a light touch of toast and the structure for further bottle age to improve it. Drink 2017–2025."
Chatom Vineyards,Red Blend,84.0,30.0,1,"A striking shade of amber/orange, this soft and fruity wine is open and loose knit, with broad flavors of mature, slightly oxidized tree fruits, plus lightly spicy notes of cinnamon and baking spices. It's very well made, but well apart from any standard approach."
Chatter Creek,Nebbiolo,89.0,38.0,1,"Nicely layered aromas of clove, graphite, iron and simmering black cherries show on the complex nose of this well-priced bottling. More iron and raspberry appear on the palate, where a balanced acidity pairs well with the strong mineral character."
Chatter Creek,Red Blend,88.5,22.0,2,"Although red cherry and raspberry make an appearance, this vineyard-designate is otherwise all about forested pine and earthy pungency, accented by a pretty floral tease of rose petal. High in acidity and tannin, it takes time in the glass to settle down and find its balance, with a lengthy finish of black licorice and clove."
Chatter Creek,Syrah,87.67,34.67,3,"Waxy apple stars in this brisk, approachable white from a single estate-farmed block, the oak briny and salty in toast and honey. Textured and elegantly light bodied, it finishes with a satisfying note of lemon candy."
Chehalem,Chardonnay,89.46,26.23,13,"Old-vine fruit delivers an elegant Pinot that combines low alcohol with graceful details of pretty spices and red fruits. Young, tangy cherry flavors are precisely defined, with a delicate tension. This might very well improve dramatically with a decade or more of cellaring. Drink 2020–2030."
Chehalem,Gamay Noir,87.5,24.17,6,"This shows the sharper, more herbaceous side of the grape, though perhaps without being fully ripe. It seems to fall away quickly into simple lemon juice flavors, with a hint of herb."
Chehalem,Grüner Veltliner,89.8,24.2,5,"A menthol/eucalyptus note shoots through the aroma of this pleasant Cabernet. It shows quickly maturing flavors of plum and pie cherry, an easy-drinking softness throughout the mid-palate, and just a hint of heat in the finish."
Chehalem,Pinot Blanc,88.0,28.67,3,"A rare 100% Petit Verdot, this is dense in red and black fruit, from plum and blueberry to blackberry, ripe enough to be in a cobbler. Cinnamon dusts the top, with a puff of smoke in the background. Balanced despite its heft, it finishes soft, ready to be paired with meaty foods."
Chehalem,Pinot Gris,89.17,21.83,6,"Made in a complex style rather than simply fruity, this smells like toasted almonds and vanilla bean. Tastes suggest not-quite-sweet Bosc pears, butter and walnuts. While the texture is luxurious the body is actually light, and the wine is not at all cloying."
Chehalem,Pinot Noir,89.24,52.48,42,"Another big, dense expression of the vintage, this has a softness to the tannins that makes it accessible, though the wine will benefit from time in the cellar, through 2017. Cinnamon and clove intermingle with black cherry and currant, finishing in a hint of tobacco."
Chehalem,Riesling,89.92,27.12,25,"This unique wine offers light aromas of white pepper, bay leaf, coffee and dried leaves. The cherry flavors are elegant with a creamy feel and a tart finish, seeming a big compact at present but developing over time."
Cherry Hill,Pinot Noir,86.8,28.4,5,"One of the winery's special block bottlings, this shows purple aromas of blackberry, violet and lilac alongside graphite and toasted oak. The palate is meaty, bitter and spice-driven, without much overt fruit, showing anise, pencil shavings, tar and concentrated cranberry skins."
Cherry Pie,Pinot Noir,91.67,56.67,3,"Powerful black cherry and blackberry aromas and flavors seem to infuse this full-bodied wine with lots of fruit energy. It tastes vivid and unique because of that deep vein of black fruit impressions, and stays balanced by firm acidity and fine-grained tannins in spite of its alcoholic strength."
Cheryl LaVrar,Pinot Noir,87.0,34.0,1,"Rounded in baked and dried fruit aromas, this is a soft, gentle wine with tangy acidity and swathes of ripe apple and orange citrus. A backbone of subtle oak gives it structure and complexity, finishing lean and bright, with a darker, richer twist of vanilla and clove in the mix."
Chesebro,Albariño,87.0,21.0,1,"This Rocks District offering has aromas of black pepper and stems, seeming a bit locked up at the moment. Flavors are palate-staining with smoked meat and assorted herbs along with a lightly tacky feel."
Chesebro,Grenache,88.0,18.0,1,"A tremendously focused blend of 42% Roussanne, 42% Viognier and 16% Grenache Blanc, this offers aromas framed by a steely minerality, as well as peach and a touch of pecan marzipan. It's light on the palate, with nectarine and ripe green apple elements."
Chesebro,Pinot Noir,87.0,23.0,2,"Dried berry, leather, cola, and herb notes show on the nose of this bottling from the mountains between the Conejo Valley and Malibu Coast. The flavors are savory at first—all crushed anise and mint—but grow fruitier as it opens, suggesting dark strawberry, blueberry, vanilla and clove. Quite quaffable."
Chesebro,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.6,25.8,5,"This wine is well balanced and solidly constructed, wrapping its ripe blackberry and dark plum flavors in firm tannins. Light oak spice, vanilla and cinnamon touches are the icing on the cake."
Chesebro,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,18.0,2,"Though not as powerful and concentrated as the Spofford Station Syrah, this wine displays the same distinctive, complex flavor palette—a mix of earth, herb, compost, fungus, smoke, rock and, oh yeah, baby, oodles of fruit. This sort of flavor profile is similar to the biodynamic wines of Cayuse, but at half the cost."
Chester Kidder,Red Blend,92.0,50.0,2,"Soft and seductive, this coffee-laced Cab Franc perfectly captures the dark aromas and crisply defined fruit of the grape. There's just a splash of DuBrul Merlot in the blend to add some buoyancy; but the Franc dominates. It's a cool-climate style, firm and tart, with natural acids and a lovely coffee and smoke streak running through polished tannins. Brilliant winemaking."
Child's Play,Pinot Noir,90.0,28.0,1,"This is taut and dense, and requires time and air to untangle. Deep, dark fruits are mixed in with layers of black olive, smoke, compost, tar, moist earth and herb—a delicious mélange of flavors that promises good things to come as the wine ages. It's masterful winemaking in a package so young and wrapped up tight that it may pass you by if you don't give it a good look."
Chime,Pinot Noir,88.0,20.0,1,"A lush and expansive, small-production wine, this weaves together dark fruit with streaks of cedar and herb, its texture fleshy, full bodied and powerful. The tannin and oak are nicely integrated, allowing for a balance of structure and flavor."
Chime,Red Blend,85.0,13.0,1,"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) makes this cuvée for Le Cadeau, and it's a triumph in this vintage. Cherry fruit ripe to the point of syrup hogs the flavor spotlight, but there's cranberry and raspberry too, putting a tangy note into the mix. Root beer and sweet cola elements combine, and there is little doubt that, good as it is already, this is a wine to cellar. Drink now–2028."
Chimere,Pinot Noir,84.0,22.0,1,"Elegantly floral and classic in dried herb, cedar, black pepper and pencil lead, this wine offers complex components of flavor and intrigue around velvety black fruit and a long, grippy finish. It impresses in its ability to be both approachable and timeless."
Chimney Rock,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.25,99.25,4,"Graphite, rose petals, vanilla and a strong yet not over-exuberant black cherry quality pump up the nose of this decadent bottling by Brian Loring. There's great tactile texture once sipped, with chalky tannins unveiling ripe cranberry, red cherry, clay, cinnamon and baking-spice elements."
Chimney Rock,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.89,122.67,9,"From Montemaggiore Vineyard on the western hills of the appellation, and containing 5% Viognier, this is a well-made wine, nicely rustic in a dirty, rowdy mix of black pepper and earth. Dense, thick layers of cocoa play with floral notes of lavender and rose, finishing softly. This will age well through 2023."
Chloe,Merlot,88.0,18.0,1,"Lush candied fruits abound in this naturally botrytised wine. With 147 g/L of residual sugar, it still reaches over 12% alcohol. Pineapple, lemon and orange peel, pine resin, honey, cedar and butterscotch are all in the mix, plus a lot more. You can go spelunking in this wine and never see it all."
Chloe,Red Blend,87.0,17.0,1,"From the winery's dry-farmed vineyard comes this bottling with seamlessly integrated aromas of boysenberry, black-pepper sauce and black sesame. A tarry character kicks off the palate and then evolves into roasted lamb with lavender-pepper crust, dried mint and tarragon flavors. A soft and deftly sewn acidity hums throughout the sip."
Cholame,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,28.0,1,"Cranberry, dried sage, sour cherry, thyme and dried chaparral shrubbery show on the nose of this wine from an oceanview vineyard near Ben Lomond. The palate is fairly lithe and bouncy with acidity, showing lots of crushed bay leaf and wild sage as well as underripe strawberry and richer cranberry notes."
Christiano Family,Chardonnay,86.0,16.0,1,"A damp herbal character shows first on the nose of this wine, with wet sage and marjoram spicing up the stewed cranberry fruit. The action explodes once sipped, with black cherry and mulberry giving backbone to the cardamom and other Indian-spice components. It combines richness and energy."
Chronic Cellars,G-S-M,88.0,40.0,1,"Heady, gamy and thick notes of lanolin, blood, lamb, smoked wood, roasted fennel, pencil lead and peppercorn rise into intriguing coriander and cumin notes on the nose of this blend of 52% Grenache, 26% Syrah and 22% Mourvèdre. Those exotic spice notes carry to the palate, where a medium acidity and clean tannic structure present black peppercorn and cardamom notes atop a boysenberry backdrop."
Chronic Cellars,Petite Sirah,87.75,17.75,4,"A lightly colored, earthy and yet intense and powerful wine, this comes from a tremendous vineyard site along Westside Road. Pretty roses and cups of black tea are evoked on the entry before supple, well-built layers of lush, juicy cranberry, pomegranate and tangy cherry come into focus, finishing complex and rich."
Chronic Cellars,Red Blend,89.67,22.5,6,"Light in color and ethereally earthy, this wine opens with delicate notes of rose petal and allspice. It then broadens into a gorgeous, medium-weight and mouthfilling sensation of red fruit and more spice, which lingers long on the finish."
Chronic Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,25.67,3,"Dense and chewy at first, this deliciously brooding wine is all about black licorice, berry and meat. Contoured layers of integrated tannin give it an understated elegance and sense of class despite its wild power and body."
Chronic Cellars,Rhône-style White Blend,89.5,20.0,2,"The hot climate of the Cold Creek Vineyard sharpens up the contours of this Chardonnay, which shows more of a classic Washington character. Bright fruit, a mix of apples and peaches and pears, is shot through with streaks of butterscotch from fermentation in new French oak. It's been through 100% malolactic, yet retains some crispness. Polished and full-bodied."
Chronic Cellars,Rosé,89.0,15.0,3,"Plenty of deep color, thick tannin and dark streaks of smoke and tar make this a stand-up steakhouse wine. The fruit does have an herbal edge but it is lingering, complex and interesting. Think of it as the vinous equivalent of a cello-viola sonata—dark and mysteriously intertwined."
Chronic Cellars,Sparkling Blend,86.0,15.0,1,"This is a supersmooth, easy-going wine with mild dark-fruit flavors, very little tannin and a soft texture. Two years aging in previously used oak barrels helped round off any corners in the mouthfeel."
Chronic Cellars,White Blend,89.0,15.0,1,"This combines 73% Grenache, 16% Syrah and 11% Mourvèdre from Stone Tree, Arianses, Ciel du Cheval and Heart of the Hill vineyards. Its vanilla, pencil box, green herb, raspberry and purple fruit aromas are followed by quite sweet, ripe, full-bodied red and black fruit flavors. The balance seems off."
Chronic Cellars,Zinfandel,88.0,24.0,2,"Aromas like black pepper, anise and grilled meat lead to nicely tart flavors and a mildly tannic mouthfeel. This spicy-tasting wine is relatively light bodied but has plenty of interesting flavors to explore."
Church & State,Red Blend,88.0,15.0,1,"Bright aromas of ripe peach, apricot, flower and jasmine lead to off-dry stone fruit flavors in this simple, straightforward quaffer."
Churchill Cellars,Pinot Noir,87.0,45.0,4,"This wine's barrel spice, barnyard, coffee and vanilla aromas lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors tinged with a strong, distracting gamy note."
Château Bianca,Chardonnay,81.0,15.0,2,"This blends cool-climate Syrah (50%) from the Edna Valley with warmer-site Petite Sirah (45%) and Grenache (5%) and shows candied cinnamon, black cherry, plum and cedar aromas. Tangy black plum and raspberry notes lead the palate, underpinned by chewy tannins."
Château Bianca,Pinot Blanc,86.0,15.0,2,"This big-shouldered blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot offers soft waves of black fruit and smoky oak. It's accented with meatier elements of brick and tobacco."
Château Bianca,Pinot Gris,82.0,12.0,1,"Reduced on the nose, this wine's petrol-like aromas dissipate as it opens, unveiling a sharp take on preserved lemon, Gravenstein apple and subtle oak flavors, its acidity reasonably sharp."
Château Bianca,Pinot Noir,85.0,20.0,2,"Marked by a taste of salty caramel pretzel and baked apple, this is a full-bodied, robustly concentrated wine underpinned by sharp acidity. Peach, pear and melon flavors take turns playing supporting roles."
Château Bianca,Riesling,83.0,12.0,1,"With 10% Malbec, this estate red is lightly spiced with clove and cinnamon notes, while fresh cherry and blackberry flavors develop on the palate. Moderate in tannin and oak, it reveals its balance as it opens."
Château Souverain,Zinfandel,89.0,25.0,1,"Nutty and reminiscent of lemon oil, this wine also offers a full-bodied richness of apple and caramel, transforming into peach and vanilla bean flavor as it opens."
Cielo,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,150.0,1,"The fascinating nose of this wine is reason enough to seek it out—an aromatic display of underripe raspberry, tart pomegranate, fresh dill, eucalyptus and sage. Montmorency cherry notes show on the palate, along with mace, Vietnamese cinnamon and fennel. A unique, refreshing and memorable wine."
Cielo,Red Blend,93.0,100.0,1,"Perfectly baked red cherry aromas are dusted with cola, slate, olive, sumac and Middle Eastern spice on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. The palate expertly balances tight tannins, bright acidity and a vibrant energy to deliver tart raspberry, thyme, forest floor and roast beef flavors that sail into the zingy finish."
Cielo,Syrah,89.0,100.0,1,"Aged in a combination of concrete egg, stainless steel and new French oak, this winning white is a study in peach and apricot—it's incredibly inviting in both taste and aroma. A layer of honey adds succulence without sweetness, as it remains dry and balanced through the mineral-laden finish."
Cielo,Viognier,87.0,100.0,2,"From a meticulously farmed site, this robust wine is intense and powerful, with a baked fruit component that makes it compelling and delicious. Forest floor, sage and rhubarb jam notes enwrap its concentrated weight and texture, with an underlying acidity that tingles the tongue."
Cima Collina,Chardonnay,87.0,31.0,2,"This is a velvety smooth, superbly made white with delightful sparks of fresh-squeezed lemon, stone and salt. Ginger and lemongrass touches add an exotic quality, enhancing its bright freshness and core of acid-led tension."
Cima Collina,Mourvèdre,90.0,30.0,1,"Wild strawberry and plum mix with subtle yet sultry notes of nutmeg, mace, loam, graphite and game on the nose of this bottling. Sizzling acidity leads the palate, carrying cherry, plum and red apple flavors, followed by layers of eucalyptus and pine forest."
Cima Collina,Pinot Noir,88.0,45.0,2,"This wine comes alive on the expansive, fleshy palate of black pepper and olive tapenade flavors. It walks a fine line between tenacious structure and high-cheekboned fruit—a mélange of raspberry, cassis and blueberry compote. The aromas are enticing and reminiscent of violets. Though it can be enjoyed now, it will evolve well through 2034."
Cima Collina,Syrah,90.0,28.0,1,"A full-boat, five-varietal Bordeaux blend. It's nicely balanced, and retains some inviting aromas of violets and candied rose petals, leading into a lip-smacking, fruit-driven mid-palate with blueberries, boysenberries and a whisper of saffron and chocolate. There is plenty of acid underpinning, and a judicious use of barrels that keeps the fruit front and center. The best yet from Tildio."
Cinnabar,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,22.0,1,"Very ripe flavors of berries and figs dominate this Cab-centric Bordeaux blend, along with intriguing side notes suggesting melon and cassis, smoke and mocha. It's a big, sexy wine, its fruit flavors backed with thick, ripe, but chalky tannins. If there is a downside, it is that it comes off as a bit monolithic."
Cinnabar,Chardonnay,86.0,20.0,1,"Ignore that misplaced accent over the ‘a' and focus on the excellent wine in the bottle. With Cabernet dominating., this wine is sleek and spicy, with a marked impression of graphite and gun metal. Although in general the '05 vintage is tilted more toward the ripe side of the spectrum, this wine retains a lean and elegant precision."
Cinnabar,Mourvèdre,92.0,42.0,1,"Cedar, cinnamon and nutmeg notes show in the aromas and continue in the flavors. This complexity blends well with the classic Merlot flavors of black cherry and subtle herbs. It's medium to full bodied, but very smooth in texture. The blend is Merlot, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah."
Cinnabar,Pinot Noir,94.0,42.33,3,"The first vintage from this estate vineyard, this is quite light, especially as the 2011 vintage was cool. It shows the delicate structure at which Pinot Noir excels. It's aromatic and varietal, very well made, and a good bottle for any roasted small bird such as squab or quail."
Cinnabar,Red Blend,88.0,38.0,2,"Fresh and young, this offers scents of violets, plummy fruit and a wash of root beer. Lively in the mouth, it has a leesy minerality that underscores rather light, pretty, but simple fruit. Drink up while it retains its freshness."
Cinnabar,Tempranillo,87.5,39.0,2,"A solid deal for the price, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc presents aromas of pine forest, damp caves and black cherry. The blueberry juice flavors fade fast, leaving black sage on the finish. The tannins are ready to drink now."
Citation,Chardonnay,89.0,30.0,1,"This spent 18 months in neutral American oak, and has a strong woody scent and flavor. Light melon and cucumber fruit remains somewhat buried, and the mouthfeel is soft and diffuse. Drink up."
Citation,Pinot Noir,87.0,60.0,1,"A hazelnut-infused dessert wine based upon Pinot Noir, it's raisined, slightly volatile and impressively nutty. It turns creamy in the mouth, with rich flavors of hazelnut, toffee plus a hint of dried leaves."
City Winery Chicago,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.67,27.67,3,"Made in a firm, dry style that will appeal to Cabernet drinkers, this smells like black cherries and blackberries and tastes full and fruity. It feels moderately tannic, well-balanced, and lingers a bit on the finish."
City Winery Chicago,Chardonnay,85.0,24.0,1,"Mostly Lemberger, from a 1979 planting, this is an explosion of sweet berry and milk chocolate—what's not to like? Luscious and full across the palate, it's a raspberry truffle in a bottle. Not sweet, so not for dessert, but in a way it is dessert all by itself."
City Winery Chicago,Pinot Noir,87.4,29.0,5,"Dark, tannic and toasty, it's a rich mouthful of wine. The fruit is moderately ripe, with light berry flavors; but the toast and chocolate and coffee barrel flavors add a lot of weight and punch. Nice winemaking from Gordy Hill turns out a delicious wine."
City Winery Chicago,Red Blend,88.67,25.0,3,"One of the finer Pinot Blancs from Oregon, this vineyard-designate has a lighter mouthfeel than the winery's Pinot Gris, yet in some ways shows more complexity and overall appeal. Fresh fruit flavors of apple and melon carry a touch of almond. The bracing minerality extends through the finish."
City Winery Chicago,Syrah,93.0,35.0,1,"With an inviting strawberry sundae nose, this bright pink rosé of Syrah from the longtime organically minded team at Buttonwood is all about summertime hedonism. There's creaminess on the palate, with some apple tartness in the middle and, again, long strawberry elements on the finish. Pair with beef sliders on soft, sweet rolls that are adorned with gourmet condiments and cheeses."
City Winery of New York,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,42.0,1,"In a cool vintage this site brings out more herbal components, here verging on flavors of green bean. But it pulls itself together with pretty berries, toasty oak, and a gentle streak of milk chocolate. The blend is 38% Merlot, 39% Cabernet Sauvignon and 23% Cabernet Franc."
City Winery of New York,Chardonnay,92.0,28.0,2,"Aged in a mixture of French oak (32% new) and stainless steel, it shows the best of both with fresh peach notes and barrel spices intermingling with crème fraîche. It's creamy in feel with the concentration winnowing slightly toward the finish."
City Winery of New York,Pinot Noir,89.0,38.0,2,"Aromas of mineral, exotic spice, leather and dried cherry lead to elegantly styled fruit, earth and game flavors. There's intrigue here but it doesn't all come together."
Claar,Cabernet Sauvignon,82.0,21.0,1,"This is a big-boned, dusty varietal wine, aged in 50% new French oak. Oak spice scents enwrap its leathery blackberry and black currant flavors, finishing on a bittersweet taste of tobacco."
Claar,Chardonnay,85.0,13.0,1,"This blends 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot into a tightly woven package of red fruit, soft tannin and robust concentration. Full bodied, it shows the warmth and distinct power of the vintage."
Claar,Merlot,87.0,25.0,2,"This blend of 61% Cabernet Franc, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Merlot is dense and boldly tannic, with varietal characteristics of dried herb and a fruity core reminiscent of wild blackberry."
Claar,Riesling,90.0,40.0,2,"Ripe and round Gala apple, peach custard and vanilla cream aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend from Tolosa's new winemaking team. It's light and easy on the palate, with steely tension framing its lemon and lime flavors, a creamy vanilla component adding weight to the midpalate."
Claiborne & Churchill,Gewürztraminer,90.5,22.0,2,"Blended with 5% Viognier and aged in a combination of new French oak, neutral oak and stainless steel, this is a full-bodied white that offers a wealth of ripe peach, apricot and key lime flavor."
Claiborne & Churchill,Pinot Noir,93.6,42.8,5,"This wine needs plenty of breathing time, revealing pleasant hibiscus, rose, cranberry and tart cherry aromas as it opens. The flavors suggest pepper and red fruit, with a somewhat leathery aged character."
Claiborne & Churchill,Riesling,91.0,26.0,3,"Dark and chocolaty, with grainy tannins under deep cassis and black cherry fruit. Full-bodied and chewy, with coffee grounds and spices filling in the finish."
Clara,Sparkling Blend,87.0,18.0,1,"From Temecula-based producer Fazeli, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon features a lofty nose that's quite herbal, drifting into eucalyptus land—and tasting of cranberry. Velvety tannins."
Clarksburg Wine Company,Chenin Blanc,87.0,21.33,3,"Grown at 2,400-feet elevation from Italian budwood, this Dolcetto, so common to Piedmont but almost unheard of in California, is muy grande, with mountainous tannins and flavors of coffee and toffee and bright notes of cranberry and cherry."
Clavo Cellars,Albariño,86.0,25.0,1,"Light fruit flavors run from melon into pale strawberry, with tannins that seem just on the edge of ripeness. Pleasant for the near term, but not for cellaring."
Clavo Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,35.0,1,"Murrieta's blend of 31% Sauvignon Blanc, 27% Viognier, 15% Sémillon, 11% Pinot Blanc, 8% Orange Muscat and 8% Muscat Canellii is well-made and likable, medium-thick and somewhat sweet in style with citrus and almond accents. Delightfully quaffable."
Clavo Cellars,Malbec,89.0,60.0,1,"This pretty, Rhône-style red blend consists of roughly equal parts Grenache, Cinsault and Syrah, with a splash of co-fermented Roussanne. It smells young and fruity, with candied scents of strawberry and raspberry. With plenty of breathing it gains a bit of midpalate weight, but the candied character remains."
Clavo Cellars,Petite Sirah,89.0,40.0,4,"Deep raspberry, plump cranberry and licorice show on the nose of this well-constructed wine. A prominent cranberry spice hits the front of the palate and carries all the way into the finish, along with a bit of pencil shavings."
Clavo Cellars,Vermentino,86.0,25.0,1,Ripe butterscotch and a notable flank of big vanilla and oak greet the entry of this vineyard-designate. It makes for a luxurious wine reflective of a warm vintage and approach.
Clayhouse,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,14.0,3,"Although plummy fruit dominates the nose, if you take an extra moment or two you can ferret out a lot more: mint, leather and vanilla, for example. The flavors feature a wintergreen component that adds a welcome degree of individuality to this offering, before fading into a medium-length finish."
Clayhouse,Malbec,87.0,14.0,1,"About a third of this is Bien Nacido Vineyard (Santa Barbara) fruit; the rest comes from Sonoma. Plenty of cedar, earth and some cherry-tomato flavors in this fruit-forward wine. Strawberry preserves and that darn hint of tomato extend into the finish, along with a fair bit of tannin."
Clayhouse,Petite Sirah,91.0,23.0,2,"Supple and easy to drink, this cherry-fruited wine easily carries its veneer of toasty, caramelly oak. This would be a great restaurant Pinot; versatile with food and in absolutely no need of cellaring."
Clearwater Canyon,Carmenère,86.0,28.0,2,"Graceful, and elegant, this offers achingly pure, tart cherry fruit, accented with notes of compost, butter and nutmeg. It's a fine example of a brilliant wine from a so-called “lesser” vintage."
Clearwater Canyon,Malbec,86.0,25.0,1,"Floral in jasmine and orange blossom, this is a sultry, full-bodied after-dinner sipper, lilting in honey goodness yet light in stone fruit and layered acidity. It is enjoyable on its own but would be fabulous alongside a peach pie or apricot tart."
Clearwater Canyon,Petit Verdot,84.0,30.0,1,"This dry, single-vineyard bottling is extremely aromatic, as only Gewürztraminer can be. The ripe lychee and grapefruit is subsumed in a cloud of baby powder. It's quite dry, and for those that want a supremely floral varietal expression of this grape, this is your go-to bottle."
Clearwater Canyon,Syrah,85.0,28.0,1,"Grown in a rather cool part of the Applegate Valley AVA, this offers aromatics of cured meat, peppery herb and a dash of iron ore. The fruit leans toward black cherry, and streaks of coffee and cola add to the complex finish. Drink now through 2025."
Clendenen,Chardonnay,94.0,50.0,1,"This sophisticated, dry and affordable wine will shine at mealtime due to its balance between generous fruit flavors and an appetizing, moderately tannic texture. Aromas resemble raspberries and red cherries, while flavors are a bit riper than that. The acidity is lively and the finish lingers."
Clendenen,Nebbiolo,91.0,35.0,2,"Red apples, sourdough bread, cherry blossoms and strawberry zest show on the nose of this ever-so-slightly pink wine. The sipping experience is reminiscent of a fizzy, foamy mouthful of Pop Rocks flavored by sour cherries, altogether fun, tart and delicious."
Clendenen,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,20.0,1,"This presents a rather fresh take on this often extracted grape, with raspberry and boysenberry juice, black pepper, dried strawberries and a touch of wild mint. There are nice coffee elements on the palate, along with sage and brown spices, but the boysenberry and fresh purple fruits shine throughout."
Clendenen Family,Chardonnay,93.0,50.0,1,"A 100% varietal, this represents a tiny offering of this single-vineyard wine. Despite its youth it is silky and supple on the palate. Rich, dense black fruit and graphite marry well and find cohesion among the toasty oak."
Clendenen Family,Nebbiolo,92.0,50.0,1,"This cuvée features grapes from some of the vineyard's oldest vines. It's a light, elegant mix of pomegranate and cherry pie flavors with plenty of natural acidity behind it. Cola and dried herb highlights add complexity, and a persistent minerality buoys the finish."
Clendenen Family,Pinot Noir,95.0,45.0,2,"Tannic and brooding in its big-boned structure, this high-elevation-grown Syrah will please Cabernet Sauvignon drinkers in its upfront oak and herb overtones. But it remains true to its varietal roots, offering bright Bing cherry, black plum and licorice, complete with loads of earthiness and ground pepper."
Clif Family,Sauvignon Blanc,88.67,28.0,3,"A witch's brew of five grapes, the Abondante is a fine wine to pair with pizza, offering interesting flavors of berry and stone fruit. What it lacks in focus, it makes up for with plenty of fruit and some unusual complexity."
Clif Family,Zinfandel,92.0,45.0,1,"With just 2% Syrah, this is a Bordeaux-style blend, feauturing mostly Cabernet and Merlot. The rich entry features berry, chocolate and espresso, with a round midpalate and polished tannins. A hint of tar runs through the finish."
Cliff Creek,Cabernet Franc,87.0,28.0,1,"This is declassified ice wine, picked frozen. It does not have the depth of the other dessert wines from Viento, but it is a remarkable effort, textural and delicate, with threads of straw, honey, cracker, candied tropical fruits and more, but all in a light and delicate style. This could easily become a wine that will amaze people in a blind tasting given the price."
Cliff Creek,Claret,85.0,25.0,1,"This 100% estate-grown Cabernet carries some of the identifying aromas of the Rocks, a part of Walla Walla where vineyards are planted on a dry river bed. Hints of earth, clay and chocolate make a lively introduction to a wine loaded with cherry and currant fruit flavors. The wine spent 20 months in French oak, but the barrel scents and flavors are handled lightly; the fruit is the star of this show. A fine debut."
Cliff Creek,Merlot,85.0,25.0,1,"Fresh-squeezed grapefruit, pomelo, Key lime, lemongrass, green papaya and Anjou pear combine for a very green, fruit-driven nose on this bottling from a vineyard just behind Pismo Beach. The palate is a tad ripe but shows apple soda, lime juice, cherimoya and apple-custard flavors."
Cliff Creek,Red Blend,90.0,16.0,1,"Ripe aromas of cherry, spice and licorice pop, with the warmth of the vintage—along with just-in-check volatiles—showing. The cranberry and green herb flavors are tart and full, yet still show some elegance and persistence."
Cliff Creek,Rhône-style White Blend,90.0,22.0,1,"Light aromas of flowers, herbs and soil are followed by tart cranberry, smoke and citrus flavors and firm, gritty tannins. It doesn't stand up by itself but has a place at the dinner table alongside a juicy steak."
Cliff Creek,Syrah,87.0,25.0,2,"The aromas are surprisingly reserved, with notes of vanilla, spice and brown sugar. The palate provides brown-sugar and purple-fruit flavors, with the vanilla notes from the oak riding high. Coffee flavors persist on the finish."
Cliff Creek,White Blend,84.0,22.0,2,"This wine is two-thirds Merlot, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Mesquite, dark cherry, vanilla, herb and spice aromas lead to tart, tingly flavors with bunched up tannins."
Cliff Lede,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,130.0,2,"Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot come together to form an herbal, medium-bodied wine that drinks lean. Cedar, black tar and leather meet black pepper and chocolate while the tannins remain tight and firm."
Cline,Chardonnay,84.0,13.0,1,"A strong boysenberry fruit character is spiced by anise, graphite, cedar and Dr Pepper notes on this bottling. The palate shows light red currant, ripe plum, mulberrry and strawberry, with a touch of pencil shavings adding complexity."
Cline,Grenache,90.0,25.0,1,"The aromas are light, with the notes of green herbs, flowers and plum, leaning pretty far into the green and savory. The flavors are plump and soft, with the concentration at times seeming faint."
Cline,Merlot,87.0,18.0,1,"Bright aromas of flowers and orange rind lead to perfumed, lightly spritzy sweet fruit flavors. Enjoy it as an apéritif."
Cline,Pinot Gris,86.0,13.5,2,"This is a juicy, buttery, nicely defined bottle with caramel and butterscotch flavors that run through its heart. Thoroughly delicious fruit notes of key lime and apple pie complete the picture."
Cline,Pinot Noir,84.5,16.5,2,"A blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah from the Armada Vineyard, this expresses its characteristic mix of superripe fruit and organic funk. Cracker, berry, spice and earth components all seem to compete a bit in the mouth and need more bottle time to fully meld together."
Cline,Red Blend,87.33,13.33,3,"Lake Chelan's Nefarious stretches out with this impressive Oregon Pinot Noir. Stiff and compact when first opened, it fills out nicely. The fruit runs from pomegranate to mountain berry to plum, with a touch of peppery spice. The midpalate continues to broaden and gather strength through a long finish."
Cline,Rosé,87.0,12.67,3,"This is the third separate cuvée of Grüner Veltliner from Reustle, and given the name (which means emerald), it's clearly meant to be modeled after the Austrian style. For those who relish a crisp, mineral-driven wine, with ripe fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, green apple and pink grapefruit, this rings all those bells and more. The length and definition are most impressive."
Cline,Zinfandel,89.6,24.4,10,"Burly in black fruit, leather and cigar, this is a smoky, full-bodied and powerful wine, richly textured in toasted oak and supple tannin. Blackberry and black currant play off each other to provide a juicy core of consistency. Drink now through 2020."
Cloak & Dagger,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,90.0,65.0,2,"Young, spicy and forward, this immediately accessible wine is a bowl of cherry candy, backed with pineapple highlights from natural acidity. It's full in the mouth, still with primary fruit flavors, but the structure to age gracefully over the next five to eight years."
Cloak & Dagger,Malbec,91.0,40.0,2,"Rounded plum and berry aromas grow more complex thanks to hints of sarsparilla bark, rose buds, cinnamon stick and nutmeg on the nose of this cool-climate bottling. The palate is quite peppery, with dried red flowers, red plums, peppercorns, strawberries and a texturally earthy core of fine-grained tannins."
Cloak & Dagger,Sangiovese,91.33,39.33,3,"Very strong white peach and lemon blossom aromas meet with roasted chicken, honeysuckle and chamomile on the nose of this bottling. Apple, pear and nectarine show on the palate, as does fresh cherimoya, graphite and more white peach toward the finish."
Cloak & Dagger,Syrah,89.0,42.5,2,"This is a very solid, well-structured and deeply flavorful wine from the first whiff of blackberries and black pepper to the mouth-coating but dry flavors to the lingering spicy finish. Best to drink after 2018."
Clos La Chance,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,50.0,1,"This is a well-balanced, handsomely composed wine that is big in flavor and full in body. The aromas are spicy like black pepper and cardamom, the flavors are meaty, peppery, smoky and berry-like, for a great taste experience that goes way beyond the usual. It's made mostly from Mourvèdre grapes, with Syrah and Grenache in supporting roles."
Clos La Chance,Chardonnay,87.75,30.88,8,"This wine takes time to unravel and reveal itself, rewarding the patient with a wealth of high-toned citrus and elegantly wound, medium-bodied honeyed pear and caramel. Lengthy and complex, it's one to consider aging and allowing to further mellow over time. Drink now through 2021."
Clos La Chance,Grenache,89.0,32.0,1,"From the relatively hot South Coast comes a big, powerful, chewy wine, with aromas of dried blackberries, light leather, some smoke and purple flowers. The real heft is on the palate, where sour tar is laced through stewed black plums, dark chocolate and herbs like dill and oregano. The tannins are a bit stiff."
Clos La Chance,Meritage,89.0,50.0,1,"Sourced from the oldest vines in the vineyard, this lovely wine is scented with rose petals, cranberries and sour cherries. Those flavors continue in a light, elegant framework, that gains power and focus as it works its way through the palate. Don't quit on this; it won't quit on you, finishing with a lick of sea salt caramel chocolate."
Clos La Chance,Pinot Noir,91.25,50.0,4,"Strong cola, fresh pomegranate, pressed strawberry and dried spearmint notes show on the nose of this blend of 40% Tempranillo, 32% Petite Sirah, 18% Zinfandel and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from east of Los Angeles. Very intriguing, extremely minty flavors pop on the palate, spicing up the baked blueberry and meaty beef elements."
Clos La Chance,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,50.0,1,"This combines a majority of Cabernet with 4% Malbec for a huge, powerfully made wine, aged almost two years in French oak. It is named for the block from which it is sourced atop the mighty Stagecoach. It's reflective in leathery tobacco and cedar and fully concentrated with flushes of dark chocolate and caramel. Drink now through 2022."
Clos La Chance,Sparkling Blend,86.0,40.0,2,"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with a sizable addition of Merlot and smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, The Discussion is lovely in spicy black pepper and clove, full bodied and softly integrated in terms of tannin and oak. A brightness of red fruit shines through, along with a distinct taste of fig."
Clos La Chance,White Blend,89.0,22.0,1,"This is an opulently lush and bold, full-bodied wine, ripe and soft on the palate with a distinct hit of oak on the entry. It evolves in the glass to reveal crisper notions of green apple, nutmeg and lemon-lime."
Clos LaChance,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,50.0,1,"Softly smoky, with pretty strawberry and raspberry fruit, this strikes a lovely balance. The mouthfeel is smooth and seductive, the flavors seamless and the balance spot on."
Clos LaChance,Carignane,89.0,35.0,1,"Judicious use of new oak meets gorgeous fruit flavors in this generous, warm and softly tannic wine. It's undeniably delicious, broad and satisfying in texture and almost viscous in mouthfeel. Enjoy it now through 2023."
Clos LaChance,Grenache,88.0,30.0,2,"A ripe Chardonnay, big and full, with fistfuls of oak influence and a spoonful of sugar to help it go down. Find some rich crab cakes in a creamy sauce and enjoy."
Clos LaChance,Petite Sirah,91.5,29.0,2,"Minty blackberry fruits mix with black loam and fudge on the nose of this wine from a winery in West Paso along Vineyard Drive. It's hearty on the palate, with dark chocolate syrup, extract espresso, black pepper beef jerky and deep purple fruits held together by lingering acidity."
Clos LaChance,Pinot Noir,89.33,50.0,3,"Coming from Gary Eberle's pioneering, 31-year-old vineyard, this presents fresh blueberries, smoke, cedar and a hearty mocha touch on the nose. It's thick on the palate but cut with strong acidity, showing flavors of chocolate-covered espresso bean, blackberry fruit and coffee grinds that last deep into the finish."
Clos Pegase,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,55.0,2,"From an estate in Rutherford that can't be named, this delightfully balanced Cab offers succulent plum, black olive, raspberry and cinnamon to great effect, melding the myriad sides of its personality well. Integrated oak and a medium-weight body allow the wine to breathe and expand on the palate, finishing in dust."
Clos Pegase,Chardonnay,86.0,30.0,1,"For an inexpensive Oregon Pinot Noir, this has a lovely, expansive aroma that mingles rose petals, strawberry, white chocolate and cola. This is elegant, supple and entirely approachable, with none of the hard, earthy, vegetal or bitter character that can often characterize inexpensive Pinots. Think of a really good village Burgundy from a ripe vintage such as 2005, but at a much better price."
Clos Pegase,Merlot,86.33,35.0,3,"Soft, silky and seductive, this qualifies as an outstanding everyday Pinot (by Oregon standards) that offers more subtle scent and flavor than most under-$30 bottles. Violets, cherries and star anise are mixed in the nose; the palate adds herbal and earthy nuances."
Clos Pegase,Pinot Noir,85.0,35.0,1,"A great value Zin from Amador. It's a briary, meaty, mountain version of America's grape with plenty of pepper to please. Grab a slab of ribs for this one."
Clos Pegase,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,22.0,1,"The reliable négociant winery scores once again on this bottling, which shows intriguing aromas of smoked plums, hoisin-marinated pork, cocoa powder, crushed pepper and ollallieberries. It's delicious once sipped, with pepper, boysenberries and a hickory wood character."
Clos Pepe,Pinot Noir,92.0,59.0,1,"A very light shade of straw in the glass, this shows distinct honey, beeswax and mead notes on the delicate nose. The flavors float on a cloud of more honey, drizzled atop Key lime pie, with vanilla syrup popping up on the finish."
Clos Solène,Rhône-style Red Blend,94.5,90.0,2,"Winemaker Christian Roguenant makes a strong series of affordable white wines from the Niven family under this label. This Sauvignon Blanc delivers aromas of lemongrass, wet stone, lime zest and white pepper. Flavors recall sipping ice-cold creek water, with refreshing notes of cut grass, honeydew melon, ripe apple and lime juice."
Clos Solène,Rhône-style White Blend,90.0,60.0,1,"Aromas of marionberry jam and smoke leap out of the glass, along with orange peel and wilted flower notes that seem a bit unsettled. The flavors are plump around the edges but light in the middle, with a mesquite note that distracts."
Clos Solène,Rosé,91.0,38.0,2,"This wine has a hot-pink color, effusive strawberry and cherry aromas and then sweet fruit flavors that give a sugary impression on the palate. It's very simple in approach and low in alcohol."
Clos de la Tech,Pinot Noir,93.73,71.09,11,"Nutty, oaky and tart, this stainless steel-fermented white shows a shock of acidity wrapped around freshly cut grass and tropical flavors."
Clos des Amis,Chardonnay,86.0,18.0,1,"This wine is earthy, peppery and grippy. It is hard to penetrate in its mix of spicy clove and sour fruit."
Clos des Amis,Petit Verdot,88.0,24.0,1,"This is a thick and somewhat heavy white wine, wrapped in oak and ripe concentrated fruit. The profile is baked apple and pear with a side note of Good & Plenty candy anise."
Clos du Lac,Rosé,87.0,10.0,1,"There's something overwhelmingly herbal and weedy about this wine, which shows a simple structure of tannin and lingering flavors of cherry cola."
Clos du Lac,Sauvignon Blanc,86.67,10.0,3,This medium-bodied wine has ripe and semisweet flavors like cherry juice and plum jam that give a soft impression on the palate.
Clos du Lac,Zinfandel,89.0,18.0,1,"This 2012 offering—100% Chardonnay that's 40% aged in American, French, and Hungarian oak—has notes of tangerine, pear, and petroleum jelly. The stone fruit flavors are sweet and rich, occasionally leaning toward the tropical."
Clos du Val,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,76.0,4,"Tart and brambly, this carries well-integrated streaks of earth and bark along with the light berry flavors. At first the tannins feel a bit rough, but the wine smoothes out and lightens up into a fresh, fruity finish."
Clos du Val,Chardonnay,94.0,32.0,1,"On the plus side are complex aromas of mixed red fruits and fresh herbs. In the mouth the wine feels just a little flat, with a chalky, tannic finish."
Clos du Val,Pinot Noir,90.0,60.0,2,"Blueberry pie, black plum, licorice and a touch of tobacco show on the inviting nose of this solid bottling from the Morgan Hill producer. The palate is very well integrated and delicious, with blackberry jam, vanilla cookies and strong espresso flavors, framed by sticky, prominent tannins."
Clos du Val,Rosé,92.0,30.0,1,"Light, bright and zesty acidity brighten this otherwise structured and concentrated wine made from heirloom selections of the variety. Measured amounts of stone fruit, oyster shell and salty minerality complement youthful weight, finding plenty of balance in the end."
Cloudlift Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.6,25.2,5,"From a tremendous site, Crossfire displays bold, brawny and extracted black fruit, from blackberry to black currant. Polished tannins still need time to mellow, suggesting further time in the cellar, through 2023. A strong streak of brushy sage, cedar and menthol rises midway on the wine, peaking on the finish."
Cloudlift Cellars,Bordeaux-style White Blend,86.75,17.5,4,"Cut apple, sliced nectarine and crisp citrus elements meet with sourdough yeast, slight jasmine, chamomile and dried dandelion on the nose of this wine from the El Jabali and La Encantada vineyards. The palate is slightly sour, with tight green apple, baking soda and lime flesh flavors."
Cloudlift Cellars,Cabernet Franc,87.83,22.33,6,"Aromas of pure black fruit, slightly burned toast, concentrated plum, black cherries and a touch of espresso show on this study of a rarely standalone grape. The palate is firm with chewy tannins yet approachable in flavors, offering dried elderberries, coffee beans, burned caramel flavors."
Cloudlift Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.4,28.4,5,"With a healthy whack of Merlot (22%), this drinks a bit more like a Bordeaux blend than a varietal wine. It enchants with aromas of high-toned herbs, coffee, toasty oak and red cherry. The cherry and black fruit flavors are layered and tightly wound, with a pleasing mouthfeel. The tannins need time to unwind."
Cloudlift Cellars,Chardonnay,88.0,20.0,2,"A blend of Merlot (73%), Cabernet Franc (24%) and Petit Verdot, it rises from the glass with aromas of cedar, flowers and red and black fruit. The black-fruit flavors are dense but deft, with firm tannins backing them up."
Cloudlift Cellars,G-S-M,89.0,34.0,2,"A fabulous blend of Zinfandel, Sangiovese and Syrah, this wine has earthy, dried herb aromas, dense fruit and dark chocolate flavors and considerable soothing tannins. It is dry in style, not too full-bodied, and has a lingering finish. Needs time to mature, and will best after 2018."
Cloudlift Cellars,Petit Verdot,91.0,32.0,2,"The aromas start out quite brooding, opening to reveal notes of green pepper, vanilla, wood spice, powdered cayenne and dark cherry. The flavors are lithe and polished, with cherry, vanilla and coffee interweaving throughout to an extended finish. It comes off as oak heavy but still impresses."
Cloudlift Cellars,Petite Verdot,89.0,32.0,2,"Tart, with brambly berry fruit, and even a bit of apricot. This was a cool year in Walla Walla, and the fruit flavors reflect that."
Cloudlift Cellars,Red Blend,86.0,25.0,1,"This popular Chardonnay gives you a generous burst of buttered nuts and toast, the flavors many consumers want in their Chardonnays. Not much going on in the fruit department—just clean, tart green apples, with a sharp, acidic edge."
Cloudlift Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,91.0,18.0,1,"A somewhat volatile nose introduces a wine that has a powerfully oaky flavor, perhaps from the 30 months it spent in 50% new American barrels. It seems a bit overdone, and the fruit heads into dry, pruny flavors. It is seemingly already past its prime."
Co Dinn,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,55.0,2,This wine has mouth-puckering tannins that make it almost impenetrable. Its baked plum fruit meets a Dr. Pepper-type cola flavor.
Co Dinn,Chardonnay,91.0,45.0,1,"The winery indicates this is from 2015, but there is no vintage shown on the bottle. On the sweet edge of brut, it smells and tastes of plastic, with a grainy, sugary mouthfeel and simple apple fruit."
Co Dinn,G-S-M,89.0,45.0,1,"This concentrated Merlot is blended with smaller percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Syrah. Dense in black licorice and toasty oak, the fruit character is dominated by red plum and berry aromas and flavors."
Co Dinn,Syrah,91.5,50.0,2,"Coming from the highest corner of the limestone-laden vineyard at 1,275 feet—with views of the entire Santa Ynez Valley—this gives off broad, approachable aromas of lit match, bacon fat, purple fruits, pepper and smoked meats. Though full of dried cherry and smoked blueberry flavors, it's leaner in texture, with acidity that keeps it fresh. Drink 2017–2025."
Cobb,Pinot Noir,92.56,76.11,9,"This wine is 79% Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. It offers brooding notes of dried herbs, cassis, spicebox, blackberry and anise. Flavors are rich yet refined with mouthwatering acids and exquisitely polished tannins."
Cobblestone,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,52.0,2,"From the Hahn family of wines comes this solid representation of the appellation, with dark cherry, wet slate and soft mint on the nose. The mouthfeel is soft and comforting, with tight raspberry fruit and a clove-like spice note carrying through the entire sip, culminating in a mouthwatering black-pepper finish."
Cobden Wini,White Blend,92.0,36.0,1,"This annually anticipated bottling offers a blend of Doug Margerum's top barrels from a variety of vineyards. In this vintage, aromas of baking spice and red fruit come with minty sagebrush lift. Herbs, from oregano to dried thyme, play a central role on the palate, with red cherry fruit and a tighter, tart plum skin finish, proving slightly lighter in style."
Coda,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,22.0,1,"This has a very deep color, even for this notoriously dark varietal. Complex aromas blend rich fruit with smoky, peppery notes, followed by mouthcoating flavors like dark-chocolate-covered blackberries. It doesn't mess around with overtly sweet oak, but stays dry, concentrated and focused. Best after 2020."
Coda,Syrah,92.0,34.0,1,"A blend of Grenache (50%) and Cinsault (20%) along with equal parts Mourvèdre and Syrah, this wine draws you into the glass with notes of smoked meat, bark, raspberry, blue fruit and peppery spices. It brings a rich, mouthful of generous fruit flavors that hit the delicious gong and then linger to hear it resonate."
Coelho,Chardonnay,87.67,35.0,3,"Aromas of cooked red cherry, blackberry liqueur and smoke waft from the glass. Layers of flavor emerge once sipped—cassis, elderberry jam, cracked pepper, cardamom and espresso—proving more approachable than heavily tannic versions of the grape."
Coelho,Pinot Gris,88.0,19.86,7,"Sadly, just 44 cases were produced, from Block 1 of the original estate vineyard. Rhubarb, cherry, cinnamon and suggestions of light tropical fruits are delicately entwined here. It would be easy to skip over the wine's complexity; you must let it breathe open and it will reward you with fascinating, subtle layers that slowly unravel."
Coelho,Pinot Noir,88.0,34.31,13,"Sourced from the Stoller vineyards, this gets a late release after aging in 38% new oak. It's soft and a bit flowery, the oak nicely integrated with flavors of spiced apple, pear and a hint of peach."
Coelho,Red Blend,88.0,26.0,1,"Oregon Grüner is still a rarity, but deserves a place of honor in the pantheon of emerging white wine grapes grown in the Willamette Valley. Grapefruit and citrus—both flesh and rind—form the core of this tart, mineral-driven wine. Even better on the second day, it remained fresh and focused."
Coelho,Rosé,85.8,22.8,5,"Chandon's smaller production sparkler, the étoile Brut is 52% Chardonnay, 37% Pinot Noir and 11% Pinot Meunier, with most of the grapes grown in Napa and Sonoma though the wine is given a North Coast label. It has a toastiness akin to creme brûlée, a bite of yellow cider apple and almond that's quite savory and a medium finish."
Coeur d'Alene,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,32.0,1,"Super fragrant, with lush scents of citrus, apple and a hint of vanilla, this excellent Auxerrois pushes confidently through the palate and into a well-defined, lengthy, slightly saline finish. Unique and delicious."
Coeur d'Alene,Chardonnay,87.0,26.0,1,"This wine's cranberry, orange peel and herb notes are atypical for the variety. Its fruit flavors are tart and elegant, needing a bit more structure to prop them up. It's a bit thin in concentration, with consistent orange peel flavors throughout."
Coeur d'Alene,Mourvèdre,90.0,28.0,1,"This wine's red apple, flower and lees aromas lead to off-dry, leesy fruit flavors that seem a bit heavy and weighed down."
Coeur d'Alene,Red Blend,89.0,25.0,1,"Reductive aromas distract from the fruit and barrel notes in this wine. The palate brings medium-bodied, mouth-puckering cranberry and cherry flavors. Vanilla notes linger on the finish."
Coeur d'Alene,Syrah,88.9,34.4,10,"Dried fruit aromas of prune, fig and nearly raisin show on the nose of this red, which is enhanced by savory touches of salt, pepper and leather. There is a pleasant rustic quality to the sip, but a strong bitterness reminiscent of bittersweet chocolate, underripe plum skins and coffee grinds arises midpalate and doesn't dissipate."
Coeur d'Alene,Viognier,90.0,24.0,1,"One of a growing number of micro-boutiques in Oregon, Vidon made its first wine in 2003. Subsequent vintages were quickly sold out, with quantities as low as two barrels of individual wines. This 2007 is in better supply, and well worth seeking out. Fragrant with sweet strawberries, hints of fresh herb, a Dr. Pepper soda streak particular to Oregon and nicely laid-in oak, it's a seductive and focused effort that masks its high alcohol effectively."
Coeur de Terre,Pinot Noir,88.73,46.33,15,"Sourced from vines planted in 1982, it's brightly aromatic with sweet floral notes, orange peel and lychee. Medium bodied, it drinks dry with abundant spice and floral flavors. A thoroughly delicious wine that begs to be paired with scallops or spicy Thai dishes."
Coeur de Terre,Rosé,85.5,20.25,4,"This soft, supple and seductive Merlot (with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend) is both earthy and sensuous. The mouthfeel is like smooth felt. Black cherry, blackberry and a dash of cola fill the mouth, with lush tannins and a long finish. There's just a hint of brown sugar as it wraps up."
Col Solare,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.67,85.0,3,"This is a knife-sharp Viognier, offering precise, chiseled flavors of citrus rind, Meyer lemon and grapefruit. The piercing acidity belies a wine whose flavors are fully ripe, and deliver an extended, mineral-drenched finish."
Col Solare,Malbec,89.5,85.0,2,"From a warm vintage, this aromatic offering has notes of candy corn, corn silk, pear and tropical fruit. It's full bodied with sweet fruit flavors that have a creamy feel and lead to a lingering finish."
Col Solare,Red Blend,90.33,63.33,3,"Estate-grown from a small family winery and entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is savory in earthy truffle, subdued plum, black cherry and tobacco leaf. A complex intermingling of pencil shavings and cedar round things out. On the palate the generous tannins are sure to smooth over time."
Col Solare,Syrah,90.0,85.0,1,"Black cherry fruit gets serious with elements of slate, eucalyptus, tar and wild mint on this wine from the Corralitos area at the southern coastal edge of the appellation. It's soft at first on the palate, then reveals a wash of acidity, with sour cherry fruit and black tea tannins."
Colene Clemens,Pinot Noir,89.33,50.33,6,"Bold and pretty at the same time, this has oodles of crushed berry aromas. Ripe fruit flavors that recall black cherry and boysenberry come with hints of toasted oak and a silky smooth texture. It's full bodied but not too stiff or tannic, just concentrated and almost sweet in its richness."
College Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,34.5,4,"This wine gets neutral French oak and it shows in its zesty profile of orange and tangerine over apple and pear. The fruit is hearty and juicy, the texture light and refreshing."
College Cellars,Carmenère,88.0,20.0,1,"Clean Asian pear, wet gravel and lime peel aromas show on the tightly wound nose of this bottling. The palate is quite delicate at first, offering lightly seared white peach, chalk and lime zest notes, but grows increasingly savory and delicious as it opens, indicating great cellar potential. Drink 2018–2030."
College Cellars,Chardonnay,89.0,20.0,1,"This estate red is named after its mountainous locale—a brambly vineyard on Pritchard Hill above Oakville. It combines quite ripe Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Cabernet Franc, 15% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot, projecting power and prestige with perfumed violet, dark cherry and savory leather and tobacco notes. Soft, pliable tannins add weight and texture. More time in bottle should add nuance; enjoy 2024–2034."
College Cellars,Merlot,87.0,22.0,2,"This is all Pommard clone Pinot from a vineyard in the McMinnville AVA. It's loaded with ripe, fleshy cherry fruit and suggestions of steely minerality, typical of the terroir. Big, full, delicious and nicely balanced, it wraps up with a yummy chocolaty finish."
College Cellars,Petit Verdot,91.0,24.0,2,"This bottling's core of black cherry fragrance is wrapped in sugar plum, balsamic, allspice and nutmeg notes, combining elegance and power. Mulberry and wild cherry flavors show on the palate, lifted by baking spice and gingerbread accents and balanced by solid acidity and tannins. A sagebrush note pops on the finish."
College Cellars,Riesling,86.0,15.0,1,"Aged in four-year-old barrels for 16 months, this bottling allows its elegant fruit to shine, showing concentrated black cherry, cola, rose petal and ginger aromas. A tight boysenberry note emerges on the palate, dusted with clove and lavender and cut by lively acidity. A thorough and complete wine."
College Cellars,Syrah,88.0,26.0,4,"There is much to like about the youthful vibrancy of this wine from Texas-raised Ryan Roark. It packs bright and fruity raspberry, pomegranate, hibiscus and crushed violet aromas on the nose. The refreshing palate pairs snappy raspberry fruit with fennel pollen and eucalyptus touches."
College Cellars,Tempranillo,88.0,20.0,1,"From 30-year-old vines, this is beautifully built and already showing the complexity that predicts a long life ahead. The old-vine grapes create a skeleton of mineral and acid upon which just-ripe fruit flavors of mulberry, plum and blueberry are placed. Drink now with pleasure, or put a few bottles away to enjoy through 2027 or longer."
Collier Falls,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,40.0,2,"Winemaker Paul Clifton excelled in this vintage, finding the balance between the region's ripe fruit, natural acidity and powerful spice. Baked black cherry, hibiscus, earth, gingerbread and cola notes show on the nose. The palate is creamy and lush, but the acidity is persistent, carrying its dark red fruit and minty chocolate flavors into the finish."
Collier Falls,Petite Sirah,88.5,40.0,2,"This vintage delivers a wine with deep and rustic cherry, boysenberry, sweet herb and rose aromas, the latter contributing a penetrating floral dimension. Pure raspberry, potpourri and thyme notes pop on the palate, where clean acidity and tight tannins provide a light frame and carry the flavors toward a caramelized finish."
Collier Falls,Primitivo,84.0,38.0,1,"A barrel-selection, top-of-the-line cuvée, this is intensely aromatic with black cherry, soft leather and baking spices in play. Flavors focus in the midpalate, leading into supple tannins and a smattering of cocoa powder. Overall it's a big wine, full flavored, balanced and already drinking very well."
Collier Falls,Zinfandel,88.33,31.0,3,"This inexpensive wine is enjoyable to drink for its raisin aromas, ample fruit flavors and comparatively soft, easy texture for the variety."
Columbia Crest,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,34.0,5,"This wine is a blend of Monette's Vineyard Grenache and River Rock Syrah (15%). The volatiles are amped up, along with aromas of raspberries and herb. The flavors are full and liquorous, showing a fair amount of heat."
Columbia Crest,Cabernet Franc,88.5,35.0,2,"This is a viscous, pruney dessert wine made from 45% Zinfandel and 55% Mixed Blacks. Labeled as 8% residual sugar, it exhibits that sweetness in an intensity of ripe, tannic blackberry and leather."
Columbia Crest,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.04,26.46,26,"Delicate in aromas of honeysuckle, Asian pear, Gravenstein apple and a smoky butter element, this shows that quality Chardonnay can indeed succeed in this warmer region of Southern California. The wine is also soft and restrained on the sip, with fresh nectarine and white-flower flavors, finishing with a familiar kiss of oak."
Columbia Crest,Chardonnay,87.61,16.33,33,"This blend of 60% Gamay, 28% Cabernet Franc and 12% Pinot Noir, sourced from widely separate vineyards throughout Oregon, is a surprising success. The flavors are ripe, recalling sweet mulberry and blackberry, and the polished tannins wrap it up nicely. Drink up."
Columbia Crest,Chenin Blanc,87.0,26.0,2,"This wine's lovely rose petal and strawberry aromas, along with other tart and tangy wild berry notes, gather with appealing weight and length. It's quite dry and finishes on a lively dash of white pepper."
Columbia Crest,Garnacha Blanca,89.0,28.0,1,"This aromatic wine offers rich fruit and floral scents. It's tart and spicy on the palate, with bright red fruit. Although aged in 42% new and 33% one-year barrels, oak-derived flavors aren't evident. Still, it's a young wine pulling itself together."
Columbia Crest,Gewürztraminer,87.67,8.0,3,"In Coelho's revamped lineup, Renovação has double the residual sugar of the entry-level Pinot Gris, clocking in at 10 g/L. Fleshed out with riper fruit, it recalls apple, pear and peach and is interspersed with honeycomb notes, resulting in a round, ripe mouthfeel that is very satisfying."
Columbia Crest,Grenache,89.0,35.0,1,"Bright golden color gives way to caramelized oak and densely packed flavors of yellow apple and anise. Crisp, underlying acidity helps balance the lush mouthfeel of luxurious weight and incorporated oak."
Columbia Crest,Grenache Blanc,84.0,28.0,1,"Given the vineyard location, on the eastern edge of the Columbia Gorge, this is a unique take on Merlot, falling somewhere between the broad, fleshy Washington style, and the thinner, more herbal southern Oregon style. The layered flavors mix berry, citrus and red plum, in an open, easy-drinking wine that should pair well with a variety of transitional autumn entrées."
Columbia Crest,Malbec,89.5,37.5,2,"Subdued and delicately ripe, this wine offers understated notions of leather, chocolate and blackberry bramble, with an electric undercurrent of fresh-squeezed citrus. Light and bright, this is a study in holding back, with complexity at its core."
Columbia Crest,Merlot,88.0,15.67,18,"Grapefruit peel and tart lemon combine for a memorably savory beginning to this crisp wine. This one integrates its acidity with a medium weight into a clean, dry and lengthy package of flavor and bite."
Columbia Crest,Merlot-Cabernet,86.67,8.0,3,"This AVA is a hotbed for this grape, as this ripe, robust effort demonstrates. Concentrated plum and cherry fruit has a whiff of leather, along with pretty baking spices. The tannins are substantial, and turn a bit chalky with plenty of skin flavors. Another couple of years of bottle age would be optimal."
Columbia Crest,Muscat Canelli,88.5,21.0,2,"All five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here, providing velvety tar and raspberry liqueur, remaining bright and fresh in a medium-bodied package. The brightness of acidity remains through the finish, assisted by a lift of cranberry and cassis."
Columbia Crest,Pinot Grigio,84.33,10.0,3,"Light and clear in color, this ethereal and delicate wine is earthy, with a brightness of cherries and a woodsy back note. Subtle in alcohol and power, it provides a food-friendly experience of cardamom and rose petals that makes it pretty on the nose and elusive on the palate."
Columbia Crest,Pinot Gris,86.25,13.5,4,"This pure Pommard-clone bottling offers lighter red fruit with highlights of cocoa and baking spices. The balance is good, and this should age well and develop interesting aromatics if cellared. Drink 2018–2025."
Columbia Crest,Red Blend,87.79,14.29,14,"This is a meaty and soft wine with a lot of power behind it. Plummy, slightly jammy yet structured, it features appropriate accents of peppercorn, cedar and toasted oak. Full bodied, it's enjoyable now and a deal to boot."
Columbia Crest,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,35.0,1,"A wealth of oak and tannin marks the entry of this wine, a blend of 62% Malbec with 30% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. It mellows on the midpalate, providing a more supple experience of baked plum, raspberry and coffee, finishing with a full-bodied flourish of vanillin toast."
Columbia Crest,Rhône-style White Blend,86.0,20.0,1,"This unfined and unfiltered wine carries itself lightly, as is appropriate to the vintage and the grape. It's clean and delicate, with light raspberry fruit and hints of leaf and dried herb."
Columbia Crest,Riesling,88.0,16.0,8,"Scents of rose powder and petals come up first, followed by hints of cherries. Then the palate brings raspberries, with a sour-candy tanginess. The cleansing acids and overall balance are pitch perfect."
Columbia Crest,Sauvignon Blanc,86.09,15.09,11,"Wet slate, cinnamon and allspice notes meet with red cherry, baked black cherry and bramble on the nose of this bottling from a popular single-vineyard source. Clay and chalky earth notes show on the palate, which is very full and rich with tart cherry, black plum and pencil-lead flavors."
Columbia Crest,Shiraz,85.0,9.5,2,"This wine is sourced from several vineyard sites across the appellation, showing off a healthy balance of acidity amidst crisp swathes of grapefruit, Asian pear and fennel, finishing in nutmeg spice."
Columbia Crest,Syrah,88.9,21.2,10,"Subtlety is not the point of this powerfully flavored, full-bodied and spicy wine. It has aromas of toasted bread and poached pears, with lots of oaky, smoky spiciness as well. To complete the picture, the mouthfeel is viscous and lush."
Columbia Crest,Tempranillo,84.0,35.0,1,"A nontraditional blend of 35% Zinfandel, 31% Merlot, 17% Grenache and 17% Petite Sirah, this offers cooked strawberry, sea-salt caramel candy, plum pudding and sweet violets on the nose. The palate shows more dry restraint, with black currant fruit and herbs of dill, oregano and marjoram."
Columbia Crest,Viognier,86.0,24.0,1,"Savory pepper, tangy blueberry, black raspberry and pencil-shaving notes show on the nose of this blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot and 4% Merlot. The cedar and graphite element carry to the palate, where tobacco, grapy fruits and dill make for an intriguing sip."
Columbia Crest,Zinfandel,89.0,32.5,2,"Mike Sinor's lighter take on Syrah from his new coastal vineyard is refreshing though not quite as inviting as the Black Label. Black cherry, white sage and spearmint notes entice the nose, before the palate breathes in tart elderberries and black pepper, presented with tight tannins and brisk acidity."
Columbia Winery,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,48.0,1,"Dark, brick colored wine, heavily oxidized, with nutty, smoky, Madeira-like flavors, and thick, dry tannins. An odd, raisiny approach to Zin."
Columbia Winery,Cabernet Franc,90.0,35.0,1,"Simple fruit and a sweet, almost candied flavor. This wine seems unbalanced. There's an odd hole in the middle, and very little weight or tannin in the finish. It's all forward, sweet fruit, more like candy than berries."
Columbia Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,28.0,1,"Plummy, ripe, beginning to oxidize. Ready to drink right now, it's got a leafy, tomato flavor to it. Unusual."
Columbia Winery,Chardonnay,88.5,37.5,2,"The more I taste Vidal, the more I find it an acquired taste—a taste I've yet to acquire. This one has intense aromas of canned creamed corn, with a few other vegetal hints thrown in for good measure. Yes, it's sweet, with balancing acidity and a rich, lush mouthfeel, but the flavors—well, let's just say they're unique."
Columbia Winery,Grenache,87.0,26.0,1,"Attractive floral aromas and bright cherry and raspberry flavors make a light, refreshing impression. This medium-bodied wine has light tannins and lively acidity in the texture."
Columbia Winery,Malbec,88.33,33.0,3,"Dank earth, dark berry and cherry are the standouts in this wine, which is a bit more lush than some of the producer's vineyard-designates. Approachable in its acidity and oak, it's a good place to start at a somewhat reasonable entry price."
Columbia Winery,Petit Verdot,89.0,35.0,1,"This mild-flavored and smooth-textured wine will be a good supporting actor at the next meal or party. It has subdued fig and baking-spice flavors, a supple mouthfeel and lightly fruity finish."
Columbia Winery,Red Blend,87.67,36.0,3,"This is a big wine in structure, but mellow and complex in flavor as if it's been well aged. Blended from Grenache, Tempranillo and Monastrell, it smells lightly sweet and tastes dry and inviting like vanilla, milk chocolate and raspberries."
Columbia Winery,Riesling,84.67,13.0,3,"This wine is pale pink in color. Lightly reduced aromas of dried herb and cherry are followed by an elegantly styled palate, etched with orange-peel flavors. It brings intrigue but the concentration doesn't always seem all there."
Columbia Winery,Rosé,88.67,24.67,3,"Aromas of cigar box, herb and cherry are followed by bright tart acid-driven cranberry flavors. The tannins bring a light astringency but it delivers a lot of enjoyment."
Columbia Winery,Sangiovese,88.0,23.0,2,"This wine is a near equal split between three varieties: Gerenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. Mesmerizing aromas of red cherry, plum, wood spice and herb are followed by quite tart elegant fruit flavors. It shows a lot of finesse but still needs some time to stretch its legs."
Columbia Winery,Tempranillo,89.0,35.0,1,"With 3% Syrah, this wine has a leathery, gamy character to it, the grapes grown at high elevation. Blueberry and blackberry notes provide a robust backdrop of fruitiness, as chewy, smoky tannins support concentrated black cherry flavor on the finish."
Comartin,Chardonnay,89.0,36.0,1,"This robust, full-bodied white is dark gold in hue, floral on the nose and voluptuously rich and layered. Honeyed creme brûlée flavors make it inviting and ripe, with an elegance on the finish."
Comartin,G-S-M,90.0,33.33,3,"Juicy and exuberantly floral, this wine is structured with a reasonable amount of tannin. Its strawberry and cherry fruit is robustly ripe, but high acidity saves the day."
Comartin,Grenache,89.5,41.0,4,"Va Piano has introduced a stellar series of single-vineyard Syrahs. But if you had to pick just one, it would have to be this massive, beautifully structured bottle from Les Collines vineyard. Concentrated boysenberry fruit leads into a firm, sleek, subtle wine with even deeper flavors of black cherry, chocolate, espresso and baking spices."
Comartin,Petite Sirah,91.0,42.0,1,"Remarkably inky in color for a Grenache-based blend, it features strong aromas of cedar, meat and deeply purple fruit. The soft, rich mouthfeel coats the palate like a luxurious lacquer, and features flavors of blackberry jam, macerated cherry and vanilla-spiced plums. The blend of florals, herbals, fruit and oak-driven tannins is masterful. Drink now by itself or with a peppercorn-crusted filet mignon."
Comartin,Pinot Noir,94.0,45.0,1,"Almost jet black, this single-vineyard reserve sports marvelously complex aromas of smoked meat and dark fruits. Those perfectly ripened and layered berry, black cherry and cassis flavors are wrapped in slightly smoky, super-smooth tannins."
Comartin,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,40.0,1,"This reserve is only occasionally produced. A stunning wine, it's tight and packed with raspberry and cherry fruit that show great concentration, well-balanced acidity and ripe tannins. The barrel-aging brings in a nice lick of chocolate to this blend that includes a small amount of Petit Verdot."
Comartin,Rosé,89.5,25.0,2,"When you're blending barrels from multiple vintages, you'd better make a fine wine. Oso Libre succeeds with this opulent offering from their Abernathy Vineyard. There is leather, mocha, oak smoke, vanilla and deep cherry on the nose, followed by a rich palate of ripe red-berry fruit and a lingering campfire-flavor finish."
Comartin,Sauvignon Blanc,89.4,25.0,5,"Ice wines are a rarity in Washington. This one offers aromas of orange peel, flowers and candied ginger, seeming to show a touch of oxygen exposure. It's sweet (155g/L residual sugar) but is still quite deft in style."
Comartin,Syrah,91.0,39.0,3,"Aromas are quite delicate for the variety and style, with fresh flowers, peach and whiffs of lychee. The palate is similarly restrained, showing elegance with the lightly sweet stone fruit flavors that are accented by bright acidity. It's all about nuance."
Comartin,Syrah-Grenache,88.0,33.33,3,"The aromas of this jazzy wine disclose lime leaf, white peach and slate. The off-dry flavors of flowers, pear and stone fruit are typical of Washington in their intensity and detail."
Communication Block,Grenache Blanc,87.0,18.0,1,"Vibrant aromas of honeysuckle, honey-drizzled peach and green apple lead to medium-sweet stone-fruit flavors. Pair it with a spicy Thai dish."
Comtesse Thérèse,Chardonnay,84.0,20.0,1,"Lees aromas dominate on this wine along with almond butter, corn husk and spice. It's weighty in feel with abundant green apple, lees and cereal flavors leading to a lingering finish. The style gets a bit out in front of the variety but there's plenty of interest to be had."
Conarium,Chardonnay,90.0,40.0,1,"Fruit and barrel mix together on this lightly colored wine with aromas of coffee, herb, woodspice and pepper. The cherry flavors are reserved in style, pulling up toward the finish."
Conarium,Pinot Noir,86.0,42.0,1,"Varietal aromas of fresh and dried herbs, flowers and cherries mix with tar, chocolate and barrel spices. The palate displays a reserved styling and a lingering finish."
Concannon,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.75,26.5,8,"Made in méthode champenoise style from Chardonnay grapes, this offers an entirely appropriate simplicity of lemon-lime citrus and green apple, with balanced acidity. It finishes slightly sweet."
Concannon,Chardonnay,88.6,24.0,5,"Bold notions of strawberry and cherry form around a robust core of oak and tannin, giving this rounded, approachable wine a medium to full-figured build. Minty earth follows, an element of herb that's refreshing on the palate and impactful, a sign of its cooler-climate vineyard site."
Concannon,Grenache,85.0,20.0,1,"A perfumed wine, this leaps up with aromas of white flowers, ginger and lychee. It drinks off dry, with a viscous, almost oily feel that provides a sense of heft."
Concannon,Petit Verdot,88.67,30.67,3,"Raspberry, white pepper, iron, dust and a Earl Grey tea element peek out from the delicate and restrained nose. Plums and red fruits mark the tip of the sip, but it clings to a gravelly, brick-laden center line of minerality, proving pleasantly peppery as well."
Concannon,Petite Sirah,88.64,36.64,14,"There are drying tannins and an earthy underpinning to this bottling of the Gravity Merlot. The cherry and cassis flavors have good grip, leading into a coffee-coated finish."
Concannon,Pinot Noir,85.0,19.33,3,"Using grapes sourced from Klipsun Vineyard, this is a roughly even Sauvignon Blanc–Sémillon blend. Flavors of sweet toast, lemon verbena and melon, with a hint of mint and a splash of orange soda are all in evidence. Nicely nuanced, this does not overreach, but rather zooms in on the details of aroma and flavor that keep it interesting."
Concannon,Red Blend,86.0,15.0,1,"Light in color, smooth, soft with a trace of astringency to the background, it shows off Barbera's marriage of acidity and denseness. It's a heavier version for sure, with spice and rustic black cherry."
Concannon,Rhône-style Red Blend,84.0,26.0,1,"Think of a pink version of Beaujolais Nouveau. The grapy flavors light up this light-bodied, extroverted rosé even more than the almost fluorescent pink color. Very fresh, light and frothy and all those qualities seem right for it."
Concannon,Sauvignon Blanc,85.0,27.0,1,"This rough and tumble Cabernet is oaky and smoky in both scent and flavor. It's a rustic, country wine, big and bold and raw around the edges, but packed with flavor."
Concannon,Sémillon,90.0,27.0,1,"This substantial wine is replete with apricot and a faint lurking of herb. The acidity is there, just faintly, racing through to the finish."
Concannon,White Blend,90.0,26.0,1,"With a strong undercurrent of bell pepper, this soft Petite Sirah has tense shadings of peppery spice and leather. Ready to drink now."
Conclusion,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,64.0,1,"Fully mature, this calls to mind an inexpensive village Burgundy: one that is just a touch past its prime. Delicate secondary fruit flavors and firm acidity are in place, with residual hints of tomato leaf and flesh."
Conclusion,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,24.0,1,"Given time to settle in both used French oak and stainless steel, this is a nice effort from a well-respected vineyard that's big and juicy in grapefruit and melon. Made in a lighter style, it offers a bite of oak on the finish, leaving a substantial impression."
Conclusion,White Blend,92.0,19.0,1,"Self-proclaimed to be the only Sagrantino in the Napa Valley (which is probably true), this wine displays varietal character in its smoky leather and its fruit characteristics trafficking in tart cranberry, orange and black cherry. It is light and subtle."
Concrete,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,20.0,1,"The nose on this bottling is very smoky and flinty, but also shows underlying pear and apple aromas. There's an intriguing lime-zest character to the palate, with a base of dried apples and a smoked-wood character that's hard to ignore."
Concrete,Zinfandel,90.0,20.0,2,"Steely and tight, this block selection reveals a chalky flavor of citric acid that overshadows the fruit, which turns thin in the finish. Ample aeration helps a bit."
Conn Creek,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.14,80.0,7,"This wine, made by a relative of the Jocko's Steak House family, is vibrant. Bright and racy, the welcoming nose offers light cinnamon notes, plump raspberries, dried rose petals and a touch of slate. The palate winds tight cranberry-raspberry fruit through layers of bay leaf and dark clay, finishing with a menthol character that lingers into the finish."
Continuum,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,225.0,1,"This combines 70% Cabernet Sauvignon with 30% Syrah, all estate-grown, and crafted into wine by Robert Foley. Herb, peppercorn and a sanguine note of wild game adorned in dried cranberry and plum pop on the palate. The finish brings strong, lasting notes of cardamom and clove."
Convergence Zone,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.5,28.25,4,"Sourced from the producer's Reserve Block and blended with 10% Merlot from its Hillview vineyard, this is classic Oakville Cabernet, velvety on the palate and spicy in cinnamon and clove on the nose. Blackberry, dried herb and baked cherry-plum pie all play a part in providing it with richness and complexity. Drink through 2022."
Convergence Zone,Chenin Blanc,86.0,17.67,3,"Blackberry, black cherry and blueberry aromas are cut by complex hints of dark chocolate and nutmeg on this Cabernet Franc and Merlot blend. The tannins are quite firm on the palate, framing black plums, vanilla, caramel, dill and dried mint flavors. Drinking 2018–2030 will allow more black cherry and blueberry character to evolve on the sip."
Convergence Zone,Malbec,89.5,35.0,2,"Fermented 40% whole cluster in concrete cubes, this stunning wine provides intensely pure aromas of red and black fruit, flowers and herbs. The dark-fruit flavors are exquisite and fresh with an extended finish."
Convergence Zone,Pinot Gris,86.83,18.67,6,"A 100% varietal, single-vineyard estate wine, at the top of the producer's heap, this was given almost two years in French oak, half of it new, the other half once-filled. Juicy, it offers refined layers of herb, currant and clove, making for a soft, complex and lightly spicy experience. With sizable structure and depth, it can be enjoyed now through 2022."
Convergence Zone,Red Blend,85.5,30.5,2,"An opulent nose surges from the bottle in this lush, exuberant wine from the legendary vineyard site. Pronounced flavors of baked apple, caramel, honey and peach combine in memorable, full-bodied ways. Textured and layered, this brooder is drinking great now but should do well with more time in the cellar, through 2023."
Convergence Zone,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,28.33,3,"Though the vineyard sources—Stillwater and Conner Lee—are first-rate, this wine seems a bit disjointed at the moment. Sweet, juicy fruit opens up into a midpalate that seems to have a hole, and then the aggressive flavors of vanilla surface. The vanilla-tinged finish feels tacked on, though perhaps some further bottle age will help to smooth it."
Convergence Zone,Riesling,87.67,17.0,3,"Light and bright, this combines 41% Syrah, 36% Grenache and 23% Mourvèdre, each sourced from the Landa Vineyard near the town of Sonoma. Menthol and cherry notes arise first on the nose and palate, riding a wave of lifted acidity, with a meaty undertone and lavender and tobacco accents."
Coomber Family Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,150.0,1,"Nutty almond aromas open this wine, along with a wave of white flower and herb scents. Light in color, it's exuberant with crisp acidity and delicate apricot and peach flavors, finishing clean and focused."
Coomber Family Ranch,Pinot Noir,84.0,75.0,1,"Coming from older vine plantings at Dionysus, Red Willow, Boushey and Bacchus vineyards, Cabernet Sauvignon (70%) takes the lead, with the rest Merlot (20%) and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of graphite, savory herb and red and black fruit are followed by refined fruit flavors. It shows a sophisticated sensibility, bringing a sense of texture and vibrancy, along with a lingering finish."
Cooper Mountain,Pinot Noir,87.0,24.5,2,"Lovely aromatics suggest wet stone, raspberry and pomegranate. This is a sleek, subtle wine. Its winery notes suggest it is a “slow bloomer” in the glass, which proves out if you give it that chance. It's balanced and resonant, with the promise of further improvement with another few years of bottle age."
Cooper-Garrod,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.75,40.5,4,"Crafted principally from estate-grown fruit, this has the complexity and downright panache of a far more expensive bottling. Mixed brambly red fruits combine seamlessly, punching through to a lingering finish etched in minerals. What a terrific value!"
Cooper-Garrod,Cabernet Franc,90.5,37.0,2,"Compostable earth marks the entry of this clonal exploration—a robust, full-bodied and ripely warm wine.With mint, pine and black tea accents, it offers wild raspberry and rhubarb fruit, bringing a homemade pie to mind."
Cooper-Garrod,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.33,38.5,6,"The nose of this bottling is pleasantly earthy and rustic, with composting rose petal, forest floor, snappy cranberry and iron-tinged aromas. It's light in body yet has a compelling tannic grip, its pomegranate and white pepper flavors proving quite delicate and focused."
Cooper-Garrod,Chardonnay,88.75,29.5,4,"An outstanding value, the latest release of this wine dazzles with bold, black cherry and chocolate mocha flavors. The focus and definition throughout are exceptional also. This is a gem at a more than fair tariff."
Cooper-Garrod,Pinot Noir,93.0,33.0,1,"Toasty aromas lead the nose of this bottling from the Parker family's own vineyard, with brioche, freshly peeled lemon and a slight walnut touch. The palate shows restraint, just barely allowing its crushed chalk, Asian pear, exotic white flower and chamomile flavors to shine through."
Cooper-Garrod,Red Blend,87.33,39.67,3,"This blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 17% Syrah, 8% Petit Verdot and 3% Cabernet Franc offers plummy chocolate and leather notes and dense, layered tannins. Toasty oak adds to the concentration and body, before a lift of acidity closes out the finish. This wine is available in three Halloween-themed labels all created for Flora Springs by CD-cover artist Wes Freed."
Cooper-Garrod,Syrah,88.83,32.0,6,"This dense, round, full-bodied red from a quiet appellation offers smoked plum and dark cherry flavors, with integrated oak and tannin."
Cooper-Garrod,Viognier,88.0,33.0,3,"The aromas are wound up at present, with notes of generous barrel spices, dried herb, dark fruit and pencil lead. The dark-cherry flavors are smooth and supple, backed by fine-grained tannins."
Copper Belt,Red Blend,87.0,20.0,2,"Syrah makes up just under two-thirds of this blend. Dark in color, it brings aromas of generous French-oak spices along with mineral, olive and dark fruit followed by a spicy top note. The palate is rich and dense, full of tightly wound cherry flavors that linger on the finish."
Copper Belt,White Blend,83.0,15.0,1,"Light in color, with depth and clarity, this wine shines with dusty black cherry and pomegranate flavors and an ethereal texture of tension and earthy acidity. Clove and orange zest touches dot the long finish."
Coquelicot,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.5,50.0,2,"Perfumed and floral, crisp and modulated in acidity, this is an exuberant expression of the variety. Ample acidiy and cherry and orange flavors unfold on the palate, followed by a brisk finish that's laced in spicy nuance."
Coquelicot,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,75.0,1,"This bottling named after vintner Bill Foley's mother shows apricot, gardenia and smoke aromas, accenting its underlying minerality that recalls hot sand on a beach. The clean and crisp flavors combine sea salt and lemon peel with Asian pear and a touch of honeydew melon."
Coquelicot,Merlot,88.0,65.0,2,"This is a rich, fragrant and luscious-tasting dessert wine. Wonderful honey, orange blossom and peach nectar aromas waft from the glass, and concentrated, luxurious, sweet fruit and floral flavors wash over the palate. The mouthfeel is rich and viscous, leaving a long finish that echoes the sweet honey aromas."
Coquelicot,Sangiovese,85.0,42.0,1,"This is 100% varietal with the fruit coming from Ciel du Cheval, Red Willow and Phinny Hill vineyards. Expressive but still wound-up aromas of exotic spice, French oak, chocolate and dark fruit are followed by pitch-black fruit flavors and tightly wound tannins. It's not yet ready to fully reveal its charms but has the stuffing to go the distance."
Coquelicot,Syrah,88.0,42.0,1,"When first opened, this seemed a bit shallow, but it blossomed with breathing time into a lovely brambly berry-soaked wine with a full-bodied palate. Streaks of cola and molasses come up also, lengthening the finish and adding texture and detail."
Coquerel Family Wine Estates,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,32.0,2,"Sourced from several appellations, including the producer's heritage Russian River Valley site, this wine offers smoky oak, bacon and blackberry jam flavors. Thick and florally perfumed, it balances its brawnier side with spice."
Cor Cellars,Malbec,90.0,28.0,1,"Plummy cinnamon and grape notes highlight this well-made, full-bodied wine's lush, soft-textured expression. It boasts integrated oak and compelling concentration, finishing in a plume of smoke."
Cor Cellars,Petit Verdot,88.5,22.0,2,"The fruit from this cool-climate AVA brings flavors of citrus rind, wet stone and green apple. It's a wine with finesse, barrel fermented and put through partial malolactic. The mouthfeel is lively, and the finish carries a hint of fresh brioche."
Cor Cellars,Pinot Gris-Gewürztraminer,90.0,20.0,1,"This bold and full-bodied wine has fragrant fruit aromas and oodles of berry flavor, plus a firm texture created by ample fine-grained tannins and supportive acidity. What makes it special is how the grippy texture wraps around the opulent blackberry and boysenberry flavors for great balance and a sense that it will age well through 2022."
Cor Cellars,Red Blend,87.0,20.0,1,"The Roserock cuvée is notably dark and concentrated, with loads of ripe black cherry fruit. The nose is spicy, and flavors are saturated with luscious mocha. This is a fine example of the vintage, ready to enjoy immediately."
Cor Cellars,Rosé,85.0,16.0,1,"This has a vibrant yellow-gold color and aromas like fresh herbs and sliced celery. Almost electric acidity pulses in the crisp grapefruit, lime and melon flavors that lead to a lingering finish. The vivid freshness and tangy texture sets it apart from the crowd, and it will work wonderfully with foods from raw oysters to roast chicken."
Cor Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,14.0,1,"Honey-roasted almonds, seared lemon vinaigrette and honeydew melon show on the delicious nose of this off-dry wine from an extreme coastal vineyard above Cambria. Though slightly sweet, it remains rich and intriguing, with lots of citrus peel, grapefruit pith, squeezed oranges and touches of petrol."
Cor Cellars,Tempranillo,87.0,26.0,1,"Grapes from three vineyards (estate, Hyland and Durant) and seven different clones are blended here, then aged for 14 months in 40% new French oak. At first sniff it's more steely than oaky, with chunky flavors of red fruits firmly underscored with highlights of earth and stem. There's a vein of black licorice also, and the wine leaves the impression that waiting until 2016–2017 will help bring out its best."
Cor Cellars,White Blend,88.33,17.33,3,"Very yeasty and slightly clouded in the glass, this wine by regional bubbly pioneer Norm Yost shows buttered plums, rising sourdough bread and freshly picked scarlet red rose petals on the nose. The mouthfeel is noticeably creamy, with more bready yeast, citrus peels and hints of hibiscus and jasmine."
Cordant,Grenache,92.0,42.0,1,"This smells as vivid as fresh-picked and crushed grapes, combining cranberry, raspberry, cinnamon and other spices. Flavors suggest black cherry, blackberry, and attractive spicy oak. It is full bodied, smooth but a bit tight in texture due to great, firm tannins and lively acidity. A nice touch of sweet-seeming oak marks the lingering finish."
Cordant,Rhône-style Red Blend,94.0,42.0,1,"Robert Brittan oversees this project. This first release is a cuvée assembled from a selection of barrels he had vinted at the Carlton Winemakers Studio. Silky and dappled with details of underbrush, bramble, black cherry, cassis, smoke and clean earth, this is a lovely blend with elegance to spare. The low alcohol in no way means this is a thin or shallow wine."
Cordant,Syrah,95.0,42.0,1,"Crafted from the oldest vines in one of the oldest vineyards in the Walla Walla Valley, this displays lovely aromatics of leaf, herb, earth and wild berry. Tight and contained, it opens into a focused, lively wine with great acidity. It has the potential to age well for a decade or more."
Core Winery,Grenache-Syrah,91.0,35.0,1,"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, the grapes are single vineyard, Rattlesnake Hills AVA fruit. The best of the Girly Girl lineup, though the promising beginning (cassis and berry, scented with black olive and herb) quickly fades into a forest floor finale of decaying leaves."
Core Winery,Red Blend,86.0,25.0,1,"This is essentially DDO's reserve Pinot Noir; it requires some patience at first, because it is quite tight, almost inscrutable. With many hours of breathing it fleshes out and opens up, revealing a wine with interesting nuances of cured meat, mushroom and light earth. The fruit is a notch more concentrated and full than the regular DDO, but retains a sense of tart berry and light cherry rather than being sweet or jammy. This absolutely must be decanted well in advance."
Core Winery,Tempranillo,90.0,28.0,1,"Savory aromas of black pepper, teriyaki-glazed steak, charcoal and elderberry jam converge for a compelling nose on this bottling. There is a strong soy richness to the sip, with grilled black plums and alder smoke flavors. It's the perfect barbecue wine."
Corkscrew,Riesling,89.0,18.0,1,"This wine's vanilla, woodspice, black cherry and dried herb aromas lead to tightly wound fruit flavors with hefty tannins. Oak plays prominently, but it largely works, needing only additional time in the bottle or a short decant to strut its stuff."
Corkscrew,Syrah,84.0,18.0,1,"This blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc shows prominent blue fruit aromas, with plum, mountain blueberry, herb and spice notes to round them out. The flavors are concentrated and texturally rich, providing a lot of appeal."
Corley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,60.0,1,"Bay leaf, tomato leaf, green peppercorns, loamy mud and a slight touch of pasilla chile show on the nose of this blend of 48% Merlot, 38% Cabernet Franc, 9% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot. Peppery spices dominate the palate, including hints of Mexican mole sauce, making for a very intriguing and elegant wine."
Corliss Estates,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.67,65.0,3,Floral cedary aromas and big berry-soaked flavors come together on a smooth but appropriately tannic texture as this full-bodied wine drenches the palate with blackberry and boysenberry richness. It combines power with complexity and has the grippy texture needed to carry all that ripeness. It was blended with 11% Petite Sirah and 5% Barbera.
Cornerstone,Cabernet Franc,90.0,45.0,1,"From Quinta Santa Rosa Vineyard, this blend of three clones shows plump red-plum and hibiscus aromas on the nose as well as sharp cinnamon, cola and sumac spices. That tangy sumac character extends to the sip, where tart raspberry makes the eyes water. Also present are fine-grained tannins and a slight touch of Early Grey tea."
Cornerstone,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.67,55.0,3,"Orange peel, fresh flower, black olive, moist earth and tire rubber aromas lead to intense, palate-coating fruit flavors in this Syrah. It doesn't seem to have fully blossomed yet but has all of the stuffing to suggest a long life ahead, with floral accents on the finish."
Cornerstone,Merlot,90.0,75.0,2,"Baked blackberries meet with caramel, vanilla, forest floor and a tart plum skin touch on the nose of this bottling by the Paso Robles-based Tooth & Nail team. It's smooth and soft on the sip, with black currant, elderberry, pepper dust, charcoal and rosemary flavors. It's ripe but with a very dry edge."
Cornerstone,Rosé,87.0,18.33,3,"Malbec and Petit Verdot each make up 37% of this wine, with the balance in Cabernet Sauvignon. The Malbec pops aromatically, suggesting clove, spice and plum. The palate is well balanced, with supple black cherry flavors and a persistent finish. It brings a lot of appeal."
Cornerstone,Syrah,90.0,25.0,1,"The only varietally labeled Barbera from the Rocks District, this offers intriguing notes of currant, savory herb, pipe tobacco and moist earth. The palate is light in body, with a mix of fruit and savory flavors that carry through to the cranberry-inflected finish."
Corvallis Cellars,Pinot Noir,86.0,30.0,2,"Black pepper and grilled beef aromas lead to ripe and almost-sweet flavors that segue from dried plum to roasted walnut and toffee, for a fascinating savory personality. Made with equal amounts Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, the wine has firm tannins and brisk acidity to balance a good rich viscosity that helps the finish linger."
Corvidae,Chardonnay,85.0,10.0,1,"The aromas smell disjointed, with notes of barrel spice, vanilla and maple syrup. The palate is quite sweet and ripe, with abundant baking-spice accents."
Corvidae,Sauvignon Blanc,83.0,10.0,1,"There's a funky, foxy note and a sour edge to this wine, which seems disjointed, or perhaps still showing a little bottle shock. Component flavors include sour plum and wild cherry, and the finish is leathery and tannic."
Corvus,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.33,35.0,3,"Smoky char takes on a grilled meatiness in this wine, a fatness of bacon and blackberry jam emphasizing the intense ripeness and grip of it all. Blackberry jam and vanilla sweetness underscore its big personality."
Cosa Obra,Pinot Noir,87.0,18.0,2,"A blend of Zinfandel with Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and Merlot, this wine takes on a heady mix of herbal cedar, tobacco leaf, tar and subdued blackberry within a context of charred oak and dense body."
Cosa Obra,Rhône-style Red Blend,85.0,32.0,2,"There's a light whiff of nail polish remover here, and little evidence of ripe fruit. Some flavors of stem come up with the tannins, and overall this is a wine best drunk soon."
Cosa Obra,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,25.0,1,"The aromas are extremely tight on this bottling, even after hour so being opened, with just the hint of black plum emergent. Chewy tannins show most strongly on the sip, which is also so restrained that not much more than dark fruit and dense coffee shows."
Cosentino,Cabernet Franc,83.0,60.0,1,"Made from a majority of 8% Merlot, the remainder Cabernet Sauvignon, this proprietary red is dry in severe acidity, with dusty tannins that overpower on the palate. Firm and ultimately light-bodied, it lacks in fruit."
Cosentino,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,15.0,1,"A fragrantly floral Primitivo laced with pepper and a depth of wild raspberry flavor, this is plenty structured and easy to like. Pair with standard Italian fare and most definitely, pizza."
Cosentino,Chardonnay,87.0,15.0,2,"A pretty, floral wine, bright with melon and honey, straightforwardly lean and ready to drink at your next picnic, hike or ski trip, a great value for a solidly well-made wine with texture to pair with charcuterie, falafel or spiced chickpeas."
Cosentino,Meritage,88.33,28.33,3,"A severe edge of dried herb and savoriness in this single-vineyard Cab evolves into juicy black currant and cassis midway through. The tannins remain tightly wound and thick on the palate, before the wine finishes dry and concentrated."
Cosentino,Zinfandel,86.0,15.0,1,"Oak, ripe pear and caramel dance to the fore of this wine's bouquet, followed by thick, textural layers of lingering vanilla cream. The oak remains pronounced throughout the glass, giving the wine a sweetness on the finish."
Cottonwood Canyon,Pinot Noir,92.0,48.0,4,"This combines the sweet spiciness of oak with the apparent sweetness of the grapes in a full-bodied, extreme-flavored package. Aromas suggest charred wood, vanilla, maple syrup and cherry juice, while the flavor conveys blackberry jam."
Cottonwood Canyon,Red Blend,91.0,46.0,2,"Already showing good focus and pinpoint acidity, th is wine brings green berries, kiwi and lime fruit flavors to the front. The bracing acidity keeps it lively across the palate, and the extra depth of the finish rewards your attention."
Cottonwood Canyon,Syrah,91.0,68.0,1,"Not afraid to wear high alcohol and toasty oak on its sleeve, it kicks off with a marshmallow, whipped cream and macadamia-nut nose, making it perfect for those who love the California cocktail style but are seeking nuance as well. On the palate, the wine is soft and buttery, with a long buttercream finish. Pair with oven-roasted chicken."
Cottonwood Winery of Oregon,Chardonnay,85.0,15.0,1,"Juicy in blueberry and explosive blackberry fruit, this offers the right succulent mix of dusty spice and well-mannered fruitiness. For pairings, aim for the usual barbecue but perhaps also a risotto or finely made pizza."
Cottonwood Winery of Oregon,Müller-Thurgau,86.0,15.0,1,"Sourced from a 35-year-old vineyard with views of the San Francisco Bay, this wine offers aromas of toasted oak, marshmallow, green pear and wet rock. The wood is quickly wiped out by brisk acidity on the palate, but then emerges again on the creamy finish. Given the acid levels in this cool vintage, this wine will evolve through at least 2019, but it's fine now."
Cottonwood Winery of Oregon,Pinot Noir,87.0,29.0,4,"Another of Borra's inventive blends, this one brings together 60% Kerner, 20% Riesling and 20% Gewürztraminer. It opens aromatically with full-blown Riesling petrol. From there, the midweight texture turns to floral notes, grapefruit and herbs, along with minerality."
Cottonwood Winery of Oregon,Syrah,86.5,17.0,2,"Richly perfumed with layers of plum and clove, this is a soft, fully developed Cab Franc. Textured and subtle in herbs, it delivers a long, peppery finish. Generous and satisfying in terms of mouthfeel, it'll serve nicely on its own or with an herb-dusted roast chicken or Liberty duck."
Cougar,Sangiovese,82.0,41.0,1,"Young, tart and compact, this is still in the primary fruit phase of its development. Clean, impactful and nicely structured, its flavors run from cranberry to raspberry to light cherry, all running deep enough to suggest tucking it away in the cellar for a few more years."
Cougar Crest,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,40.0,1,This is a standout in this price range. The well-defined cherry/cranberry fruit is wrapped in fresh rosemary and tarragon spices; the tannins are polished and there is an intriguing scent of pine forest that permeates the finishing flavors also. Such complexity is not always found in wines twice as expensive.
Cougar Crest,Malbec,85.0,35.0,1,"Auxerrois, a cross between Pinot Noir and Gouais Blanc, creates an aromatic, lively, citrus and pear fruit-flavored white wine with a delicious mix of fruit, spice and even a hint of white chocolate. Fresh and more interesting than many Chardonnays, this is a sure-fire crowd-pleaser at any picnic or barbecue."
Cougar Crest,Red Blend,86.0,20.0,2,"This offers strong oak and smoke aromas, plus ripe black cherry, chocolate and plum flavors. Full body and firm tannins make it assertive. Not a cocktail wine, this needs to pair with some heavy meat."
Cougar Crest,Syrah,89.0,38.0,1,"This bottling utilizes fruit from the winery's original 1975 plantings. Aromas of jasmine, flowers and lime lead to off dry, lightly spritzy stone-fruit flavors that linger."
Couloir,Pinot Noir,92.8,50.0,5,"This rare bottling of this variety displays aromas of pear and spice along with whiffs of tropical fruit. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied with a creamy, slightly unctuous feel."
Courtney Benham,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,40.0,1,"This wine packs a big wallop of superripe flavors, so it doesn't taste as petite as its name. Aromas like raisins and rhubarb lead to deep, overripe fruit flavors recalling prunes and dried cherries. An overall feeling of full body persists, but without much tannin to support it."
Courtney Benham,Red Blend,84.5,12.5,2,This wine is equal parts Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon fermented and aged in stainless steel. The aromas and off-dry flavors of grass and fig seem a bit muddled but still bring enjoyment.
Couvillion Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,27.0,1,"Made with 75% Sangiovese, with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon and Barbera, this wine has aromas of barrel spices, coffee, dark raspberries and herbs. It's medium bodied with plump fruit flavors, tart acids and a lightly chalky feel."
Couvillion Winery,Red Blend,86.0,25.0,1,"This light-bodied wine brings enjoyment at a very low price. Attractive grapefruit and dried herb aromas followed by citrus and savory flavors make it appetizing and enjoyable. It tastes dry, fairly crisp and well balanced."
Covenant,Chardonnay,90.0,38.0,2,"From a single, high-elevation block of the Alden-Ellis Vineyard, this is somewhat muted aromatically, preferring to present itself in waves of oak and cigar box. Big tannins and weight surround a soft, approachable palate that's ready to enjoy now."
Covenant,Red Blend,91.0,44.0,1,"This aromatic wine brings a potpourri of freshly rubbed sage, Dimetapp, bay leaf and sweet tobacco. It's broad yet light in feel with a pretty sense of elegance and restraint."
Covenant,Roussanne,90.0,20.0,1,"There are very savory aromas on this wine, with campfire smoke and herb-crusted game dominating the boysenberry fruit in the background. The tannins are edgy, and toasted oak flavors persist in a pleasant way, with black cherry and licorice present as well."
Covenant,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,24.0,1,"This intriguing blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Cabernet Franc (40%) and Merlot offers green herbs, dark plum, savory notes and chocolate. It's full and supple in feel with soft tannins and well-framed acidity."
Covenant,Syrah,93.0,40.0,1,"Aromatically appealing, this suggests black raspberries, tart cherries and herbs, with light citrus and barrel accents. It's tart and quite restrained for the variety with plumy fruit flavors and a slightly chalky feel to the tannins that may resolve with some additional time in the bottle."
Covey Run,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,29.0,1,"This bottle is quite unusual for a Washington Malbec with abundant notes of freshly squeezed Meyer lemon, plum and herbs. Still, it's well constructed with tart, plush plum flavors that keep you coming back to it."
Covey Run,Chardonnay,84.5,9.0,2,"This wine offers notes of vanilla, coconut, chocolate and cherry candy. It's richly flavored with a core of dark fruit backed by lightly grippy tannins."
Covey Run,Fumé Blanc,85.0,9.0,1,"Very tasty, this medium-bodied version puts forward bright raspberry and ripe red cherry aromas and flavor. Not too big or bold, it's well-balanced with acidity and moderate tannins to bolster the fruit flavors."
Covey Run,Pinot Grigio,84.0,9.0,1,"For the price, this Merlot packs a delicious punch, offering soft, persistent layers of chocolate, tar and leather, the tannins present yet well-managed. Red fruit and smoke intermingle on the palate, playing well together."
Covey Run,Riesling,85.0,12.0,1,"This is an earthy and somewhat savory wine, buoyed by level acidity. It offers stewed lemon and fennel around a feral nose."
Covey Run,Sauvignon Blanc,84.0,9.0,1,"A solid, all-purpose wine, this has some toast and vanilla components, along with straightforward fruit that hints at green apple. There's a little spice and butter in the aromas also."
Covey Run,Syrah,84.5,9.0,2,"Grass, wet concrete, bitter orange rinds, wet hay and rosemary elements show on the nose of this single vineyard bottling. There is a firm, cement-like texture to the sip, much like licking rocks, with fresh lime peel flavors. It retains freshness days after opening."
Covington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,20.5,2,"This cuvée is principally from the estate (Appassionata) vineyard. Lush, spicy and spread broadly across the palate, it pleases with strawberry-raspberry fruit, milk chocolate and a dusting of cocoa powder. The wine does seem to lighten up rather quickly at the finish, but further bottle age may fix that."
Covington,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.5,60.0,2,"This is a well-made wine from a specific site, seamless in full-bodied texture and sumptuous flavors of golden honey, baked apple and pear. Dottings of nutmeg provide additional punch and intrigue, while a lifted braid of acidity shines on the finish."
Covington,Red Blend,85.0,30.0,1,"Thick and lemony, this is a juicy fruit-powered style. It places its power squarely on plush fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, candied orange peel and candied pineapple. It saw no oak and needed none. Drink while it's at its freshest."
Covington,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.5,45.0,4,"This is sourced from a steep site on the southern end of the appellation, a sunny location that provides concentration and weight to the wine. Smoky, herbal and earthy, it offers a wealth of rounded tannin and approachable texture that's complemented by dark cherry, blackberry, clove and vanilla."
Covington,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,88.0,25.0,2,"Feral earth and forest highlight a plush, lush texture of full-bodied ripeness and voluptuous personality in this wine from the famous site. Baked strawberry, raspberry and cherry meet cola and cardamom as buzzing acidity cuts through on the finish."
Covington,Syrah,86.0,35.0,1,"Dusty pencil shavings mark the nose of this fulsome, generously ripe wine, thick and soft in integrated layers of black licorice, sage and dark chocolate."
Cowhorn,Grenache,88.83,37.0,6,"Reduced on the nose, this massively intense and tannic wine is big, dense and juicy, broadly etched in leather, blackberry, currant and black licorice. Full-bodied and oaky, it shows the concentration of the vintage and the ripeness of the appellation and style."
Cowhorn,Rhône-style White Blend,90.8,26.8,5,"Subdued on the nose, this is a thick, juicy red made in small amounts that offers affordability within its bright streak of cassis and currant. A backbone of tannin provides strength and concentrated power."
Cowhorn,Syrah,91.25,60.0,8,"This wine sources from both Montecillo Vineyard in Sonoma County and Georges III in Napa, bringing together one barrel of each for an herbal, savory and edgy experience. Cedar, clove and a healthy dose of fresh herb make it compelling in a classical sense."
Cowhorn,Viognier,93.0,50.0,3,"Subdued red fruit is kept fresh by moderate acidity in this boldly dense and grippy wine rich in violet aromas. Soft, integrated oak adds a spiciness of black pepper and vanilla, while the overall experience is balanced and relatively lean."
Coyote Canyon,Malbec,83.0,38.0,1,"Wonderful cedar and tobacco aromas, sophisticated cinnamon and dark-fruit flavors, lavish tannins and full body create a gorgeous taste experience. This wine is plush and generous in texture, and exotic and delicious in flavor. It should age well through at least 2020."
Coyote Canyon,Primitivo,85.0,25.0,1,"There's a feral quality to this single-vineyard bottling, with dried rose petals, damp pine needles, dehydrated shiitake mushrooms and touches of violet, potpourri and dried ginger on the nose. The mouthfeel is velvety, with lilac and lavender decorating a base of cranberry and boysenberry fruit."
Coyote Canyon,Red Blend,86.0,38.0,1,"A consistent standout for this winery, the new vintage does not disappoint. Jazzy and jammy red-fruit and spice aromas are followed by rich, plump, beautifully balanced fruit flavors followed by an extended finish. It only ramps up over time. It's a prototype of the variety and about as good as it gets from the state."
Coyote Canyon,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.5,25.0,2,"This is an unusually perfumed commingling of varieties not always seen together, including 45% Tannat, 44% Syrah and 11% Counoise. But it works. Black cherry, black tea and orange peel come together seamlessly on the nose and palate, with a high-toned acidity balancing the 60% new French oak and healthy proportion of whole-cluster fermentation."
Coyote Canyon,Roussanne,87.0,19.0,1,"The power of smoky oak shows strongly on this wine. Black-cherry fruit aromas are woven in with caramel, fudge, vanilla and cappuccino scents. A strong tannic structure frames the palate, with juicy black-cherry and blueberry flavors enhanced with milk chocolate and more caramel. Drink 2017–2033."
Coyote Canyon,Tempranillo,85.0,25.0,1,"Decadently rich in caramel and vanilla on the nose, this vineyard-designate evolves into more delicate floral elements, with a depth of spicy oak and baked apple and pear. Throughout the medium body and medium acidity is a freshness of lemon and lime, with a slight twist of tangerine."
Coyote Canyon,Viognier,86.0,19.0,1,"Intensely dense and feral, this wine opens with a thicket of tart cherry and strawberry, followed by leathery black pepper and lavender. Medium in body and acidity, it works for the table, finding balance as it goes, before a rich taste of toffee finishes things off."
Crane Family,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,33.0,1,"A blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, the Tavola Rosso is a wine that seems to be in search of a distinct identity. Tannic, drying and vanilla soaked, it has a red fruit flavor that vanishes all too quickly."
Crayelle Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,84.0,29.0,2,"Smooth and supple, almost silky, this dense and delightful Syrah begins with a smoky, meaty run of sweet cherry and berry flavors, then quickly adds interesting nuances of herb and leaf and earth. The cherry fruit triumphs, along with cut tobacco and a whiff of clove, as it weaves through a long finish."
Crespi Ranch,Pinot Noir,85.0,22.0,3,"Fresh and fruity, it has aromas of red currant, cranberry, plum and orange peel. These are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors with cranberry-like acidity."
Criss Cross,Zinfandel,87.0,20.0,1,"Offering a more traditional California Zinfandel style than some of the other 2011s, this takes off with scents of a warm, butter-crusted cherry pie, unfolding on the palate with cranberry jelly. There's a slight herbal character and quite of bit of tannic grip, so expect this one to improve in the years to come."
Cristom,Pinot Gris,92.0,20.0,1,"Quite light, in both mouthfeel and flavor, this has simple, rather generic fruit and a bit of butter."
Cristom,Pinot Noir,91.21,53.05,19,This soft wine has a roasted fruit quality to it. Layers of jammy berry and plum show amidst a savory profile of tamed tannins and earth.
Cristom,Syrah,88.0,50.0,2,"The fruit is soft and faded in this wine, which is otherwise soft-medium in body,. It's made by a longstanding producer of Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon."
Cristom,Viognier,92.0,27.75,4,"Mouthfilling and slightly jammy, this blend of 35% Syrah, 25% Primitivo, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc is showing its age. Hints of smoky, savory fruit and earth just barely linger on."
Croma Vera,Albariño,87.0,26.0,2,"Floral aromas and flavors mingle in a sweet, slightly soapy midpalate. The fruit is nondescript; what is most noticeable are the brown, sweet spices."
Croma Vera,Tempranillo,87.0,34.0,1,Cherries and strawberries abound in this elegant wine. Old-vine fruit was fermented and briefly aged in neutral barrels that somehow lend a subtle hint of apple-pie spices to the wine. A perfect late summer sipper.
Crossfork Creek,Syrah,93.0,40.0,1,"Fresh and vibrant aromas of dark cherry and purple flowers get serious weight from a touch of tar on this very balanced, tighter Cabernet. Dark red fruits, sweet plums (and their more tart skins) and even blueberry show on the palate, which is equally acidic and tannic. It's neither lean nor lush, but right down the middle."
Crown Point,Red Blend,95.0,185.0,1,"A lightly funky whiff of the chicken yard underlies the aromatics, but for most tasters it will be an asset, as it does not block the pretty cherry fruit. These forward, appealing cherry flavors, matched to natural acidity and lengthened with that whiff of funk, make for a delicious and value-priced effort."
Cru,Chardonnay,88.5,26.5,2,"Full-bodied, structured and leathery, it's characterized by a combination of plum and gamy meat, accented by a taste of black olive tapenade. It finishes smooth and toasty."
Cru,Pinot Noir,91.0,50.0,2,"With 4% Petit Verdot added for body and color, this Cab is otherwise on the brighter side of red fruit and acidity, nicely balanced and approachable in cranberry, cassis and a wink of violet. It's not as meaty and robust as the winery's Morisoli, a tamer version of a similar beast."
Crux,Rosé,90.0,24.0,1,"Brilliant pink with a touch of orange, this refreshing and light-bodied wine tastes fresh and strawberrylike. It has an appetizingly crisp texture and clean fruity finish."
Cubanisimo Vineyards,Pinot Noir,85.11,29.67,9,"By “Old Vine Cabernet” the winery refers to vines that were planted in 1973. But somehow the fruit doesn't express old-vine character. Instead, it's a mix of sweet-tasting strawberry and bitter stem flavors that lack focus, with a peppery highlight."
Cuckoo's Nest,Muscat,84.0,13.0,1,"Here is a straightforward Malbec that offers the expected mix of berry and herb flavors, plus a suggestion of minerality and a whiff of sweatiness. It's a good companion for a burger or a steak."
Cuckoo's Nest,Viognier-Gewürztraminer,86.0,15.0,2,"Coming from the original plantings at this esteemed vineyard, this wine brings brooding, high-toned aromas of savory herbs, exotic spice and cherry. The palate is all about sophistication and delicacy of flavor, showing nuance and detail, particularly considering the warmth of the vintage."
Cuda Ridge Wines,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,55.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (42%), Cabernet Franc (34%), Merlot (15%) and Malbec. Aromas are fresh and fruit filled, with notes of raspberry and black cherry, along with abundant spice and herb accents. The palate is vibrant and flavorful, delivering hedonistic appeal as well as freshness. The emphasis is on elegance."
Cuda Ridge Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,60.0,1,"Plummy cinnamon notes meet fruity coconut depth in this ripe, soft and brightly constructed wine that's rich and full-bodied."
Cuda Ridge Wines,Malbec,90.0,55.0,1,"Fermented in a concrete egg, this is a texture-based style with subtle penetrating minerality. The fruit flavors suggest peach, pear and Meyer lemon—not big and rich, but elegant and satisfying."
Culton,Petite Sirah,91.0,49.0,2,"This is an impressive bottling of well-distributed wine, blended with smaller percentages of all the major red Bordeaux varieties (plus 1% Tannat). Spicy clove, leather, cedar and herb hints highlight its subdued red fruit. The tannins are grippy and oak quite present, but both provide welcome structure and strength."
Culton,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.33,61.67,3,"Velvety blueberry and blackberry notes highlight the moderate structure of this blend of 35% Grenache and 32% Syrah with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Carignane and Counoise. Lightly spiced with nutmeg and white pepper, it's balanced and food-friendly, with a soft, round texture."
Culton,Rhône-style White Blend,92.0,40.0,1,"An excellent effort, this deserves its “limited” designation, and not just because it's a three-barrel selection. Dense raspberry and black cherry anchor a substantial wine with plenty of well-ripened tannins. Spending 22 months in one-quarter new French oak adds streaks of dark chocolate and espresso. The acid-tannin balance is spot-on."
Cultura,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,36.0,1,"Light, subtle pink color echoes this wine's subdued nature on the palate, which reveals whispers of orange peel, strawberry and rose as it opens."
Cultura,Cabernet Franc,91.0,40.0,1,"Mushroom and forest floor notes provide a welcome and rich earthiness on the nose of this wine, which delivers juicy acidity beneath its denser savory tones. Tobacco leaf and black currant and clove add underlying seasoning."
Cultura,Merlot,92.0,36.0,1,"This barrel selection brings bright flavors of salmonberry and raspberry, with highlights of citrus peel. It's precise and tart; less ripe than many wines from this warm year, but balanced and focused."
Cuneo,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,18.0,1,"This wine tastes concentrated and powerful, from the first whiff of spicy cedar and black pepper to the smoky, dried fruit flavors and mouth-coating texture. It owes its savory, smoky character to its exceptionally long 30-month oak ageing. Yet while bold and assertive, its alcohol is restrained."
Cupcake,Red Blend,87.67,14.33,3,"The Daou brothers aren't known for subtlety, so it's no surprise that this Sauvignon Blanc is rich and plush with oak-kissed peach, smoked apple and toasted nut aromas. There's good energy and grip to the palate, with tangy Meyer lemon rind flavor and that powerful oak smoke that's uncommon for Central Coast whites but befits the house style."
Curran,Grenache,92.0,18.0,1,"Creamy in mouthfeel and spicy with acidity, this is a well-heeled, lightly crafted wine with integrated crispness and peach and lemon highlights."
Curran,Rosé,92.0,28.0,1,"French and Hungarian oak cradle the dusty juice of old vines in this soft, integrated wine, brawny in strawberry, orange zest and cheese rind. Black pepper and a note of leather close out the lengthy, spicy finish."
Custard,Chardonnay,86.5,22.0,2,"Seductively tart in lemon pith, cranberry and pomegranate, this refreshing, light-bodied quaff is infinitely enjoyable, both on its own or at the table. It continues to expand on the palate into an increasing array of fresh flavors, finishing in cherry and orange."
Cutruzzola,Pinot Noir,92.0,47.5,2,"This is a lovely expression of this vineyard site, sometimes classified as Sonoma Coast. It captures the cool-climate province of the vines in crisp, classic ways, allowing elegant layers of pear, guava and lime to express and coalesce, finishing with a tease of voluptuousness."
Cutruzzola,Riesling,91.67,29.33,3,"This juicy cuvée is aged entirely in French oak, blending Mourvèdre with Syrah, Grenache and Cinsault to good effect. High acidity marks the palate, giving it freshness amid the earthiness of blueberry and leather."
Cuvaison,Chardonnay,90.0,32.4,5,"This wine is mostly Grenache (70%) along with Mourvèdre and Syrah. The aromas of raspberry and peppery spices are light and pure. The red-fruit and plum flavors are elegant yet sumptuous in feel, with the oak pulled back. It's unabashedly appealing and a great value to boot."
Cuvaison,Pinot Noir,89.75,40.0,4,"Herb aromas mix with notes of blue and black fruit and sweet barrel spices on the nose, showing smoked meat in the background. The dark fruit flavors are broad in feel and linger on the finish."
Cuvaison,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,18.0,1,"This bottled-aged beauty, made by Syrah expert Andrew Murray, is redolent on the nose with lavender, violets, dense black fruit and a touch of tar. Great depth and structure show on the chewy palate, with black flavors of tar, espresso and nearly fudge complementing the rich yet tangy red-cherry fruit."
Cuvée Lucia,Pinot Gris,90.0,15.0,2,"All varietal, aromas of crushed rock, black licorice, barrel spice, green pepper, pink peppercorns and savory herbs lead to a well-balanced palate backed by firm, lightly grainy tannins. It needs time still to fully come together but has more than enough stuffing to go the distance."
Cuvée Wine Cellars,Pinot Noir,86.0,30.0,1,"Mourvèdre (39%) takes the lead, followed by Grenache (36%), Syrah and Cinsault. Pitch-black blackberry aromas are brightened by notes of raspberry jam, graphite and herbs that enchant the senses. It's fruit forward and flavorful with a fine sense of balance and an undeniable, warm vintage appeal."
Côte Bonneville,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.25,85.0,8,"Aromas of tilled soil, herbs, flowers, olive, black pepper and orange peel lead to fresh, elegant smoked meat flavors with spot on balance. It's a unique expression of the variety from the state that keeps you coming back for more."
Côte Bonneville,Chardonnay,90.0,50.0,4,"Black-cherry compote rises on the entry of this wine that's medium in acidity and use of oak, with a punchy sense of sleek, savory fruit and baking spices. Friendly and fleshy, it's a meatier exploration of the variety by the producer, with a rounded, lengthy finish."
Côte Bonneville,Riesling,92.0,22.0,2,"Hot and volatile, showing some browning around the edges, with chocolaty/pruney aromas. Consistent style—over-ripe, oxidized, a bit flat in the mouth, still shows some green herbal tannins."
Côte Bonneville,Syrah,92.25,65.0,4,"Sanguine and floral, this soft wine exudes waxy plum and cherry around a midweight core of earthiness. Shy in fruit, it finishes with a somewhat diluted character."
Côte Nicault,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,75.0,1,"Fragrant aromas of apple blossoms swirl with a buttery croissant yeastiness on this bottling from Paso's Eastside. The palate tastes of green banana, with dried apples and apricots as well as ripe cantaloupe and a slightly buttery finish."
Côtes de Ciel,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,60.0,1,"A vineyard blend that includes 16% Petite Sirah, 2% Carignane, 4% Mataro and 1% Alicante Bouschet. Meaty, funky and ripe, with intense fruit, lots of earthy, barnyardy accents, and a long, tannic finish. This is old style Zin, no holds barred, with full-throttle flavors for aficionados."
Côtes de Ciel,Cabernet Franc,92.0,39.0,1,"Toasty nose, bright fruit, makes for a classy, creamy, zippy Zin. This is really a pleasure, balanced and forward and full of life. There are some nuances of tar and spice in a balanced, exceptionally lively, seductive wine."
Côtes de Ciel,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,50.0,1,"Extracted, tannic, dark and dense, with briary, jammy fruit and thick tannins. Blackberries and chocolate, set off with lots of acid. It's a sensational, balanced, bold, ageworthy Zin."
Côtes de Ciel,Petit Verdot,93.0,39.0,1,"Fat fruit, juicy and ripe, brimming with wonderful fruit flavors. The wine is unctuous, sinfully lush, and still balanced with berries and spice and some good toasty oak. Young and hard, but good stuff with a nice life ahead."
Côtes de Ciel,Syrah,90.0,55.0,1,"Intense, alcoholic, and wonderfully complex, with layers of toast, spice and fruit. The vines range from 50 to 80 years old or more; the wine is robust, balanced and muscular. St. Francis makes a flat-out wonderful Zin year after year, vintage after vintage, big and bellisimo."
D'Alfonso-Curran,Chardonnay,96.0,65.0,1,"Young, tight, firm fruit, with nuances of blueberry dominating. Tannic, dry and tight, it's well made with excellent structure and balance. Tight right now, high-toned and tart, but with a good, long life ahead."
D.R. Stephens,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.75,123.75,8,"Well-made, with clean, bright fruit and lots of pretty new oak. The wine is beautifully balanced, elegant with a long, rich, toasty finish. Fairly light fruit in this vintage, but well handled and perfectly showcased."
D.R. Stephens,Chardonnay,92.0,60.0,3,"Big, fruity wine, with layers of fruit, earth, toast and oak. Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit leads into toasty, dry tannins. There is a lovely density, buttressed with new oak, but anchored with ripe, firm fruit. Lovely winemaking."
D.R. Stephens,Pinot Noir,90.5,75.0,2,"Firm, ripe and fruity, with a nice mix of plums, berries and earth. The mountain fruit shows good acids, some mineral elements, and a long, complex finish with a fair amount of earth and barnyard. A distinctive, earthy style."
DAOU,Cabernet Sauvignon,95.0,100.0,1,"Old vine clone, with brambly, gamy notes throughout. Lifts up the palate with lively, bright flavors. Good concentration, balance and follow-through."
DENO,G-S-M,89.5,30.0,2,"Ripe, round, toasty wine, with rich, plummy fruit and a full-throttle palate feel. Nicely made and surprisingly evolved; jammy and pleasure-packed. Finishes with a pleasing fruit sweetness."
DENO,Red Blend,91.0,35.0,1,"Blackberries are the story here, boatloads of rich, ripe, jammy blackberries. There is just a whiff of volatile acidity, then a wonderful mouthful of fruit with some stony earth underneath. Shows a light touch with the oak, good acids and a deft handling of the tannins."
DaMa,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,18.0,1,"This is the 33rd vintage of this landmark Zinfandel, which, since it's a blend that includes just 74% Zinfandel in it, isn't technically Zinfandel at all. Whatever. It's just plain delicious, old-vine, succulent juice. Jammy, juicy, vibrant and tight, it has a long life ahead."
DaMa,G-S-M,89.0,32.0,1,"Full bodied and well-oaked, this full-throttle Zin comes on with intense blackberry and vanilla aromas and flavors accented by cinnamon and chocolate notes. Ripe and even on the palate, the handsome fruit plays out on the lengthy finish with tart, dark berry and pepper notes."
DaMa,Red Blend,90.0,21.0,1,"Rich, concentrated, and loaded with smoky, dark, spicy fruit flavors, this is a full-on Bordeaux blend, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. There's plenty of barrel influence, from 70% new French oak, but it's welcome, and appropriate, perfectly matched to the power of the fruit. An underlayer of woodsy earth and mushroom adds further complexity."
DaMa,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,35.0,2,"Rich, almost unctuous, with a lush, lanolin mouthfeel, this is a passionfruit creamsicle of a wine. The fruit is a seductive and generous mix of peach, Asian pear and tropical; the alcohol a full-bodied 14.5%. The Roussanne part (58% of the blend) is barrel fermented; the Viognier done in stainless. Blended together they harmonize beautifully."
Daedalus,Grüner Veltliner,87.0,21.0,1,"This reserve is the best of Kason's 2007 releases, with cranberry fruit, minty spice, moderate tannins and overall balance. The thinness of the vintage shows through, and this will need to be drunk now, rather than cellared. Aging in 80% new French oak puts some toast into the finish."
Daedalus Cellars,Chardonnay,87.0,25.0,1,"The 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend adds extra muscle to this toasty, sleek wine. It's light but polished, with pretty scents and flavors of rose water and raspberries. The generous acidity of the grape keeps it lively and fresh."
Daedalus Cellars,Riesling,89.0,21.0,1,"Deep ruby pink in color, this wine begins with a nuanced nose, mixing the fun of grape soda with the elegance of purple flowers. On the palate, it's a tad boozy for pink wine, but the flavors of cherry and currant stand out in front of the alcohol. It would make a nice companion for a dish with ample flavors and actual warmth, such as chicken soup or a tuna melt."
Damiani,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,35.0,1,"Light salmon in color, this herbal rosé dances on the palate with a slight effervescence and 5% residual sugar. It offers a bouquet of robust red fruit and rose petal aromas, and saw no oak."
Damsel,Cabernet Franc,91.0,32.0,1,"A dense, bombshell of a blend, this is comprised of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache. This tannic beast is somewhat reduced and chewy, committed entirely to meat, tobacco and leathery flavor."
Damsel,Syrah,89.0,42.0,2,"Flavors are restrained in this medium-bodied wine, so there are not a lot of fruits or herbs to shout out. However, it has a straightforward appeal and will make an unobtrusive pairing with many foods because it has a good, crisp mouth feel."
DanCin,Chardonnay,91.9,30.3,10,"Very focused and pure fruit aromas and flavors give this medium-bodied wine a tasty and straightforward personality. The texture is relaxed due to soft acidity and tannins, and everything tastes fresh and clean."
DanCin,Pinot Noir,91.64,36.29,14,"The fruit has veered somewhat funky and stewy here, giving the wine a soft, lean quality that struggles to share its quiet undertones of cherry and vanilla."
DanCin,Red Blend,85.0,35.0,1,"At 12g/L residual sugar, this just barely qualifies as dry. Fruit flavors suggest lemon curd and green pineapple, and there's an interesting savory note. But flatness across the palate keeps the score from going higher."
DanCin,Syrah,92.0,35.0,2,"Super dusty, leathery and big shouldered, this is also quite bright and drinkable. Made using grapes sourced from old vines planted within the Esola Vineyard."
Dance,Chardonnay,89.0,37.0,1,"This is a pure Grenache, tart and spicy, with powerful herb components. It is not fruity or sappy-sweet by any measure, but it delivers moderately concentrated flavors highlighted by herb and earth notes, with good length and balance."
Dancing Coyote,Albariño,88.0,12.0,1,"Dense, layered and juicy, this has a good concentration of bright blackberry flavor. The small amounts of Primitivo and Barbera are subtly apparent. With a snap of chocolate on the finish, it's well rounded."
Dancing Coyote,Grüner Veltliner,89.0,12.0,1,"Fenestra, an estimable producer of obscure Spanish and Portugese varieties in California, does not disappoint with this Verdelho. Like a just-ripe pineapple, the wine is high in acidity and savory in strong tones of lemon and lime. Clean and fresh, it pairs well with seafood."
Dancing Coyote,Petite Sirah,86.0,14.0,1,"A Grenache-based Rhône blend, C'est Si Bon is good and very subtle. Like a Beaujolais, an earthy leather note emerges in between soft violet and raspberry tones. With a line of acidity, it's a fine wine for food."
Dancing Coyote,Pinot Noir,84.0,14.0,1,"Appealing aromas of tobacco, smoke and spice herald the masculine edge to this red blend. Flavors of chocolate, smoke, spicebox and pepper are carried by a bright, red fruit wave. A touch tart on the finish but overall well rounded."
Dane Cellars,Grenache,88.0,40.0,2,"Fresh and fun with a nose of rhubarb and spice. On the palate, strawberry and spice is delicate with a touch of tartness. A great go-to summer sip that will pair nicely with salmon, grilled meats."
Daniel Cohn,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,23.5,2,"This G-S-M blend is solid and flavorful, with mixed berry flavors and an underpinning of graphite. The tannins are drying, on the edge of being chalky."
Daniel Gehrs,Cabernet Sauvignon,83.0,24.0,1,"This is Primitivo-Barbera blend with dabs of Nebbiolo and Dolcetto in the mix. It's light and youthful, with cranberry fruit and the sort of juicy acidity that freshens the palate. Not especially concentrated, but crisp and clean, with a bracing minerality."
Daniel Gehrs,Syrah,85.0,24.0,1,"Herbal and tight, with a whiff of burnt rubber in front of some tart fruit. There is some concentration, and with more bottle age the wine may yet flesh out a bit."
Daniel Wines,Pinot Noir,91.0,60.0,2,"A multigrape blend that seems to be lacking focus, this tastes strongly of vanilla and butter cookies, the fruit extremely light."
Dante Robere,Barbera,85.0,31.0,1,"Solid and varietally correct, this brings citrus and melon fruit flavors in modest proportion to a simple, but balanced midpalate. It carries a hint of sugar in the finish."
Dante Robere,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,46.0,1,"A Bordeaux-style blend, tart and fruity, with an unusual fruit flavor mix that starts with citrus and orange and runs into bright berries. Two things keep the score down—a chalky edge to the tannins, and some noticeable volatility (a whiff of nail polish)on the nose."
Dante Robere,Grenache,85.0,29.0,1,"The winery remains committed to French Colombard, honoring its heritage with this wine. Wet stone, apple and lemon distinguish it most, both in terms of aromatics and taste. Crisp and refreshing, it's a fun wine to begin the night, served chilled and shared."
Dante Robere,Mourvèdre,88.25,32.25,4,"Three months in stainless steel result in a very pale wine with aromas of lemon peel and grapefruit flesh. The palate is painted with bright, citrus zest acidity throughout, yet retains the varietal's flavors of nectarine flesh and yellow melons. It makes a leading option for the unoaked crowd."
Dante Robere,Red Blend,90.0,38.0,1,"Effervescent in honeysuckle and papaya, this vineyard-designated white offers medium body and a long length. It becomes a rounded expression of melon and minerality on the palate that's both fresh and fruity."
Dante Robere,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.4,36.0,5,"An unusual commingling of 50% Petit Verdot with 50% Merlot, this wine is expectedly big and soft. Aromas of coconut and baked bread waft to the fore before dry layers of cranberry and blackberry pack their own punch. This wine screams out for a juicy steak."
Dante Robere,Syrah,90.33,36.0,3,"Named after the winery owners' kids Niki and Kiara, this blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Malbec, 14% Petit Verdot, 12% Cabernet Franc and 4% Merlot offers roasted game and subtle blackberries on the nose. It's more complex on the palate, with smoked plums leading into licorice and coffee in the midpalate, finishing on nice and easy tannins."
Danza del Sol,Chardonnay,87.0,30.0,1,"A juicy wine certain to please those who opt for the hip label, this is quite showy on the nose, with densely packed blackberries, clove, caramel and vanilla elements. The rich palate is equally poppy and boisterous, with black cherry jam, allspice and nutmeg notes."
Danza del Sol,Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,44.0,1,"Tight tannins support a blend of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon with 21% Petit Verdot, 11% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc. Black fruit, tobacco and leather give it a robust profile, finishing full bodied and ripe."
Daou,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.67,68.5,6,"A blend of near-equal parts Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Merlot topped off with a pinch of Petit Verdot, this wine exhibits aromas of barrel spices, dried herbs and cherry, showing whiffs of volatility. The flavors are soft and pure, lingering on the finish."
Daou,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.5,82.83,6,"Almost dark enough, as well as fruity enough, to be a red wine, this tastes fresh and has a touch of candied character. The wine is medium bodied, resembles cherries and raspberries in flavor and carries enough acidity for good balance."
Daou,Chardonnay,91.5,46.0,2,"Aromas of black pepper are prominent and are followed by notes of dark plum that display purity. The palate is reserved in style, yet the fruit tones linger on the finish. It's hard to place the variety but it still brings plenty of appeal."
Daou,Red Blend,92.0,63.0,4,"Strawberry, herb, orange peel and mocha aromas are subdued and show some reduction. The palate possesses tart acidity and chalky tannins with a mocha and citrus-filled finish."
Daou,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,65.0,1,"The aromas of jasmine, honeysuckle, ripe peach and botrytis are bright. The mouthwatering stone-fruit flavors are sweet and persist, with white flowers on the finish."
Daou,Rhône-style White Blend,90.0,36.0,1,"This is not a showy wine, but the sense of reserve, good acidity, fresh flavors and good balance form an enjoyable picture that will be versatile with food."
Daou,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,50.0,1,"Quite light in the glass, this wine offers crisp and tight aromas of Japanese pear, peach blossom and custard torte. It's light and easy on the palate, with honeysuckle and cooked-apple flavors cut by lemon juice."
Daou,Syrah-Cabernet,89.0,46.0,1,"A great entry-level Riesling, fresh, floral and delicate, the Two Vines offers refined, even subtle flavors of green apple and melon, with lovely natural acidity. Despite considerable residual sugar, it does not seem overly sweet."
Daou,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,85.0,1,"Bold, succulent black cherry and currant flavors combine with softer, more elegant notions of graphite, coffee and clove in this well-made, full-bodied, 100% varietal wine. Volcanic soils comprise the Sonoma Mountain slope where the vineyard is located, contributing a gravelly hint of reduction."
Daou,Zinfandel,90.0,56.0,1,"Troon is going all in on Tannat, and this latest release—all estate-grown—marks a dive into natural winemaking. That means hand-picked, foot-stomped, native yeast and no additions during fermentation. Smooth, almost burnished to a fine gloss, this has dense fruit flavors of blueberry, boysenberry and blackberry. A dark streak of espresso, graphite and charcoal adds extra weight and length."
Darby,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.2,33.6,5,"Dark cherry and black licorice flavors combine in this wine from a 1,650-feet-elevation, estate-grown site. Moderate acidity buoys the fruit's ripeness and concentration, structured with firm, tight tannins."
Darby,Grenache,90.0,45.0,1,"Woody, herbal and integrated in oak and tannin, this wine comes from grapes grown in both Sonoma Valley estate vineyards and sites in Alexander and Knights valleys. Red currant, graphite and clove flavors highlight its medium-bodied density."
Darby,Marsanne,91.0,25.0,1,"Candied macadamia nut, ripe pear and toasted marshmallow aromas may sound over the top, but they're all in balance in this bottling. The palate is tangy with mandarin and lemon skin accents that give depth to the toasted almond and beeswax flavors."
Darby,Syrah,89.5,33.5,2,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up half of this wine, with the balance Merlot (31%), Malbec (15%) and Cabernet Franc. Barrel notes of vanilla and baking spice are up front, followed by herb and dark fruit tones that are backed by lively acidity. It currently drinks very tight. Give it some time in the cellar or an extended decant. Best after 2020."
Darby,White Blend,90.0,25.0,1,"Tart raspberry fruit limned with orange peel provides excellent definition across the palate. It's bright and tangy, with the balance and construction to develop nicely over the next five to eight years. Drink now through 2025."
Darcie Kent Vineyards,Cabernet Franc,90.0,30.0,1,"Like most of Neil Collins' wines, this blend of 63% Grenache, 19% Zinfandel and 18% Petite Sirah draws from the region's intriguing, oldest, dry-farmed vineyards. It shows earthy wet clay, boysenberry and anise notes on the nose, while the palate delivers turned loam, wild thyme, pepper, soy and black plum flavors."
Darcie Kent Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.5,32.0,2,This tartly acid-driven effort from Mumm includes Chardonnay and Pinot Gris. Honeyed aromas lead into a luxurious palate of thick mousse and crisp green apple flavors.
Darcie Kent Vineyards,Chardonnay,90.33,32.5,6,"Light pretty red fruits mingle here, supported with tart citrus. It's an elegant, rather steely style, and one that needs aeration and a bit of patience. The best drinking window should be 2020 through 2025."
Darcie Kent Vineyards,Grüner Veltliner,87.67,23.33,3,"This blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 13% Petit Verdot and 7% Malbec is warm and inviting on the nose, with baked blueberry, caramel, vanilla and violet touches. The palate continues its purple flavor theme with a core of blueberry fruit, but dried herb and mocha spice provide more complex layers."
Darcie Kent Vineyards,Malbec,86.0,25.0,1,"Made from a mix of 58% Chardonnay and 42% Pinot Noir, this delivers sweet peach and homemade biscuit scents. A dry, seductive mousse gives it body, while moderate acidity—which presents as fresh lemon peel flavor—gives it lift."
Darcie Kent Vineyards,Merlot,84.0,24.0,1,"Thin and tart, with aggressively astringent tannins. There is a noticeable scent and flavor of rubber as well."
Darcie Kent Vineyards,Petite Sirah,85.0,24.0,1,"This Carmenère from an excellent vineyard is listed at a whopping 14.7% alcohol, but the nose and the palate do not comply. It is aggressively vegetal, with thin, canned pea flavors."
Darcie Kent Vineyards,Red Blend,88.5,37.5,2,This estate-grown 100% Syrah is sour and inelegant on its own but would have worked nicely in a blend where it could have provided meaty structure.
Darcie Kent Vineyards,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,20.0,1,"A Zin with notes of cedar, leather and sour red fruit, this offers tannic grip from start to finish. Slightly savory, it shows hints of toasty vanilla on the finish."
Darcie Kent Vineyards,Zinfandel,88.0,32.5,2,"Smooth-textured, this features a sprinkling of sugar, peachy flavors and a hint of honey. Light in body, attractively fruity and easy to sip."
Darioush,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.5,153.25,4,"Opening with aromas of barbecued meat, this soft Cab is all about ripe, meaty tannins and smoky oak over any suggestion of fruit, which is hidden among its cedar and tobacco-lined walls."
Darioush,Chardonnay,90.0,45.0,1,"Fans of Moscato will like this bubbly, semidry version. With a syrupy profile and aromas of artificial vanilla, it offers plenty of juicy fruit."
Darioush,Sauvignon Blanc,93.0,45.0,1,"Made from the Spanish grape Tempranillo, this is light salmon in color, restrained in style and just slightly sweet. Fruit nuances do come out on the palate and finish, adding interest."
Darioush,Shiraz,95.0,74.0,1,"This stylish and well-priced wine from Brian and Stephanie Terrizzi offers aromas of grape juice, shattered slate, charcoal ash and a sharp, peppery spice. The blackberry juice flavors are broad, approachable and pleasantly airy on the palate, but quickly given complexity with coyote-brush woodiness, iron shavings and a solid tannic grip."
Dark Horse,Pinot Noir,88.0,10.0,1,"This has lots of jammy and peppery aromas and flavors, tastes dry, is very full-bodied, and feels rich but tight with tannins. Although bone dry and almost austere, it's honest and refreshing."
Dark Horse,Red Blend,87.33,10.0,3,Yorkville's Malbec has pleasing aromas of dark plum and fig and is medium-bodied. A good wine that's fairly low in alcohol.
Dark Horse,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,10.0,1,"Slightly spritzy and slightly sweet, this ready-to-drink Chardonnay has a soft entry that hints at oxidation. Perfectly pleasant for everyday drinking, it will show best if chilled."
Darms Lane,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,60.0,1,"Aromatically a bit dull, this blend of 54% Syrah, 25% Cinsault, 11% Mourvèdre and 10% Grenache is structured, dense and lush, tasting of tar and black fruit."
Dauntless,Pinot Noir,85.67,31.67,3,"Aged over two years in American oak with fruit grown in Amador and Lodi, this Syrah is all oak and leather, recalling bacon on the grill like a diner on a workday morning. Balanced in the mouth with come-hither tannins."
Davenport Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,88.0,16.0,1,"Oaky and tannic at first sip, this wine has a softness waiting to let loose on the palate and reveal more floral cherry and raspberry notes. Through and through, the standout characteristic is dried herb, plenty of it, especially on the finish."
Davenport Cellars,Sémillon,90.0,19.0,1,"A beautiful shade of mauve, John Jensen's blend of grapes from Monterey and San Benito counties boasts complete aromas of dried rose petals, frozen grapes and raspberry shave ice. The palate is dominated by raspberry juice with lemon-lime elements, and is more tight than bountiful."
Davenport Cellars,White Blend,89.0,16.0,1,"Very juicy if straightforward aromas of blueberry and blackberry rise off of this fun and easy-drinking Syrah from the Carhartt family, whose estate is in the middle of the Santa Ynez Valley. The palate builds on those ripe elements with a bit of tar and dried fruit."
David Clinton,Zinfandel,87.0,27.75,4,"Reductive at first, this wine opens to show aromas of coffee, dried herbs, carob and eucalyptus, with the barrel notes initially taking the lead followed by blue fruit. The fruit flavors are silky in feel with abundant coffee and plum notes backed by rustic tannins."
David Girard,Grenache Blanc,88.0,28.0,2,"Soft in classic layers of cinnamon and clove, this wine is almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, with a wealth of black plum and blackberry constituting its inner soul. The finish lingers in black pepper and more of that opening spice."
David Girard,Mourvèdre,86.0,34.0,1,"Aromas of melted caramel, barrel spices, kiwi and pineapple rise up from this wine. The fruit flavors are lighter in style and lead to a warm finish with abundant fig notes that linger."
David Girard,Rhône-style Red Blend,86.0,30.0,1,"A relatively tiny offering from the winery, this white showcases a 44-acre estate site planted to the variety since the 1970s and offers subtle aromas of lemon and lime. Medium in weight and mouthfeel, it ventures into ripe kiwi and pear before ending in a lift of wet stone."
David Girard,Syrah,89.0,75.0,1,"Quite grassy and brisk in style, this wine releases generous aromas of cut tennis ball, wet cement and sour limes. That citrusy acidity and sour-grass energy picks up lime pith, green-apple skins and a touch of white pepper on the palate, a very classic profile."
David Hill,Chardonnay,86.4,17.6,5,"Cherry compote and a flair of kirsch preside over well-tended acidity in this full-bodied wine. Earthy lavender and herb give the wine an ethereal character atop solid, velvety texture and a big oak finish."
David Hill,Gewürztraminer,89.25,17.75,4,"From a vineyard planted on the edge of Freestone by James MacPhail of MacPhail Family Wines and respected grower Jim Pratt, this wine opens with a splash of white pepper that persists on the soft, silky palate. Roses and black tea provide savory flavor, with an intensity of forest floor."
David Hill,Muscat,87.0,28.0,1,"This refreshing sparkling wine made mostly from Pinot Noir grapes has a light-gold color and slightly toasted or earthy aromas. It feels lively and frothy in texture, nicely crisp in balance, and medium bodied. Ripe apple and peach flavors emerge with each sip."
David Hill,Pinot Blanc,88.4,20.6,5,"Slightly funky aromas of dried, composting red and purple roses meet with crushed mint, vanilla and red berries on the nose of this complex bottling. Pomegranate, red plum and strawberry fruit show on the palate, bolstered by wet gravel, thyme and black-pepper spice."
David Hill,Pinot Gris,90.4,16.6,5,"The Meyer Vineyard, in the Red Hills of Dundee, ripened especially well in 2006, bringing forth concentrated fruits that mix raspberry, cranberry, pie cherry and finishing hints of rhubarb. Spice and sharp acids add definition to the midpalate, and the careful barrel aging has introduced accent notes of nutmeg, licorice and black tea. Despite its heft and substantial 14.6% alcohol, this wine has a sleekness that carries it gracefully into a lengthy, elegant finish."
David Hill,Pinot Noir,89.22,37.17,18,"Le Cadeau's Equinoxe Cuvée is the winery's most limited offering, just 110 cases. Quite distinctive, it carries a high, piercing caraway note, but also offers rich, ripe, chunky cherry fruit and streaks of cola and caramel. It's concentrated and chewy, a substantial wine with a soft, lengthy finish incorporating earth, leaf and pepper."
David Hill,Riesling,89.8,16.0,5,"All Pepper Bridge vineyard fruit—62% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Syrah—this is right in line with the excellent 2006 Sayulita, which came from the Lefore Vineyard. Bright fruit, tart and tangy, gives a juicy, fresh quality to the mouthfeel. Lots of high-acid berry flavors, are accented by light chocolate and caramel notes from 20 months in second and third use French oak."
Davies,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.6,77.0,5,"Bésoleil remains Grenache-dominated, but this new vintage includes 14% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre, and (for the first time) 9% Cinsault. Bright and penetrating, the brilliant raspberry fruit is the star here, tart and fresh, with the juiciness of a young Zinfandel."
Davies,Pinot Noir,91.57,56.43,7,"As before, this is 100% Syrah from the Red Willow Vineyard's oldest vines. It can seem rather light when first opened, with pretty raspberry scents that carry delicate hints of herb. Complexities emerge with airing: more subtle whiffs of earth and flower and flavors that don't overwhelm, but seem to keep adding interesting threads of blueberry, black cherry, Asian spice and game."
Davis Bynum,Chardonnay,90.0,25.0,1,"Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Cinsault are included in this blend, along with a splash of co-fermented Roussanne. As with all the Tranche releases, the aromatics are seductive, the mouthfeel smooth and textural and the fruit immaculate. Brambly berry and plum flavors link to a finish with veins of graphite and cola."
Davis Bynum,Pinot Noir,91.5,50.0,8,"The blend in this new vintage remains three quarters Sauvignon Blanc and one quarter Sémillon, but amps up the alcohol a notch from the 2011 version. It's a lightly toasty, very flavorful wine, adroitly mixing slightly bitter skin flavors, citrus pith and flesh, and a tangy core of grapefruit and pineapple. The length and detail are impressive."
Davis Bynum,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,25.0,4,"This Bordeaux-style blend is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Petit Verdot and 9% Merlot. The PV shows through in the ripe, textural tannins. The concentrated berry and cassis fruit is annotated with barrel notes of vanilla, coffee and tobacco. This is a hand-crafted wine with distinctive, albeit somewhat rustic, appeal."
Davis Estates,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,85.0,2,"This is a knife-sharp Viognier, offering precise, chiseled flavors of citrus rind, Meyer lemon and grapefruit. The piercing acidity belies a wine whose flavors are fully ripe, and deliver an extended, mineral-drenched finish."
Davis Estates,Pinot Noir,88.0,30.0,2,"A fine companion to the winery's Lumière Chardonnay, this takes the grape in a much different direction. Here old vine grapes fall under the influence of barrel fermentation with wild yeast. Aged in 40% new French oak, and (presumably) put through malolactic fermentation, it's a buttery bonbon of a wine, tasting of brioche and baked apples, with a silky smooth finish."
Davis Estates,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,35.0,1,"This is a broad, leafy, late harvest Zinfandel, augmented with a splash of brandy. Mellow cherry tobacco flavors saturate the palate, smooth and lingering, with a lick of vanilla and butterscotch as they weave through the finish."
Davis Family,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,65.0,2,"This is the winery's estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon, and it opens rather stiff and herbal. It's a taut, dark and deep wine that rewards decanting, showing good concentration and dense layers of brambly berries, licorice and espresso. Age for at least another decade."
Davis Family,G-S-M,90.0,42.0,3,"Young and still tightly-wound, this excellent example of Yakima valley Syrah combines fruit from both Boushey and Olsen, two of the best sites for the grape anywhere in Washington. Aged in 30% new oak, it's showing generous streaks of graphite, smoke and char, with accents of cured meat around the blackest of black fruits. Well-named and well-constructed."
Davis Family,Pinot Noir,91.8,55.0,15,"This beautiful wine includes 9% Cabernet Franc that gives a lift of floral violet and grainy cedar. Classic all around in its etchings of coconut shavings, graphite, spice and dust, the fruit is additionally savory in bright red currant and a crunch of cassis, with an underpinning of soft, succulent blackberry."
Davis Family,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,42.0,1,"As the Stolpman family's top-of-the-line bottling each vintage, this wine impresses on all fronts. Candied boysenberry, dried lilac, snapped dark chocolate and hints of dried mint show on the nose. The entry into the palate is refined and soft with juicy mulberry and elderberry fruit plus touches of thyme and forest floor. Firm but polished tannins and a decent dose of acidity ensure long drinkability. Drink now–2029."
Davis Family,Rhône-style White Blend,90.25,30.0,4,"Hailing from a precipitously perched vineyard above Carmel Valley on the coastal end of the region, this bottling offers baked red cherries, beets, rhubarb pie, cinnamon spice and a touch of iron-rich soil on the nose. There's a powerful chalky grip to the sip, with rising oregano and marjoram herbs laid across an earthy core of deep red fruit and peppercorns. The finish shows dried mint."
Davis Family,Syrah,91.0,42.0,1,"Pear and anise introduce this robust, voluptuous wine that's brimming in high-toned acidity. It becomes more lengthy and complex as it develops in the glass. Touches of baked pineapple provide a tropical edge amid wintertime nutmeg and spiced lemon. This is a beautiful, full-bodied wine that's lush and memorable."
Day,Pinot Noir,86.6,41.8,5,"This is a lovely, full-bodied wine from a historic vineyard site on Westside Road. Bready and brambly, it offers a juicy, exuberant palate that's rich and layered in blackberry, coffee and a persistent backdrop of white pepper. It's structured and balanced, with a deft twist of dusty dried herb."
Day,Red Blend,85.5,37.5,2,"This Guerneville-area estate is one of the last picked by the producer, and it delivers enviable depth and complexity. Highlights include a dollop of apricot jam beside rich honeycomb and toasty oak. Juicy acidity supports its creamy tendency toward tropical flavor, as streaks of citrus fiercely protect its freshness."
Day,White Blend,88.0,18.0,1,"Winemaker Doug Boeschen has but one acre of this variety, and he puts it to tremendous use here, in this tamed, food-friendly expression of a robust grape. This vintage is his first single-bottling of PV. Soft, integrated tannin supports juicy black currant and a svelte layering of dark chocolate, punctured by an arsenal of beautiful violet aromas."
De Coelo,Pinot Noir,92.75,81.25,4,"X is for extra dry, and this is, made from 74% Pinot Noir, the remainder Chardonnay. It jumps out of the glass in an explosion of nutty, salty lemon peel, dry as a bone and rewarding in its full embrace of minerality. This sparkler begs for oysters and a skiff out to sea."
De Fina,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,75.0,1,"Baked black plum, gingerbread, dried mint, clove-laden cherry pie and a touch of light licorice show on the nose of this rich style of Pinot from the Santa Ynez-based, family-owned winery. The palate starts with rich black-cherry fruit, but then dives into an intriguing wash of thyme, sagebrush and anise, finishing on dried cranberry and pomegranate."
De Loach,Chardonnay,92.91,48.64,11,"Plush black-currant aromas meet with light licorice and a plum-pudding note on the nose of this 70% Grenache, 28% Syrah, 1% Mourvèdre and 1% Viognier blend. It dries up tightly on the palate, showing blackberry alongside strong licorice and violet elements, all framed by a chalky structure."
De Loach,Pinot Noir,91.4,48.0,5,"From the only producer to source Zin from this famous vineyard, this wine is abundant in a complexity of baked bread, blackberry jam and vanilla, with endless depth on the palate. Fresh and juicy, it balances its fruitiness with mountain-sized tannin strength and concentration."
De Loach,Zinfandel,92.0,45.0,1,"The eponymous winemaker of this brand is based in San Francisco, from which, in this bottling, he turns out a stunner. Focused, intense, energetic and yet delicate, the nose is full of just-ripe raspberries, bay leaf, thyme, eucalyptus and chipped slate. A sip reveals crushed herbs galore, from oregano to anise, set against tart pomegranate and red plums. Menthol shows on the finish."
De Novo,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,82.0,39.0,1,"This smoky, earthy, soft and delicate wine comes from an estate vineyard planted in 1999 in the Occidental Hills. Rose petals and cranberry mingle effortlessly on the silky palate, while a bite of black tea and tannin tease on the finish."
De Novo,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,27.0,1,"From heritage clones of Wente and Mt. Eden, this top-end Chardonnay from the Foley family offers salted peaches, hazelnuts and crushed sea shells on a nose that recalls a steady sea breeze. It's light and brisk on the palate, with yellow pear, nectarine and lemon salt, all wrapped by a grippy texture. Excellent by itself, it would pair with foods from shellfish to roasted chicken."
De Ponte Cellars,Pinot Noir,91.0,62.5,2,"Roasted and raw beef, dried strawberry, crushed marjoram and salt-and-pepper seasonings show on this Syrah. Extremely dark in the glass, it's bolstered by 4% Grenache, 4% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier. Elderberry fruit kicks off the palate, following by pepper, coffee grinds, espresso beans and dark-chocolate sauce, surrounded by grippy tannins."
De Tierra,Chardonnay,87.0,26.0,1,"This wine is aromatically untoward with notes of seabreeze, green herbs, citrus and wood. It's medium bodied, somewhat gritty in feel, with barnyard flavors."
De Tierra,Pinot Noir,89.0,52.0,2,"This opens with a strong sense of coconut that abruptly hits pomegranate and cranberry on the palate. The sweetness of the coconut dissipates on the finish, which veers slightly sour."
De Tierra,Riesling,89.0,26.0,1,"There's a funky herbal, slightly green quality to this wine, possessed of plenty acidity, as the variety is known for, yet muted in its typical floral aromatics and bright fruit."
DeLille,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.62,66.62,13,"This has a firm texture and ripe to overripe fruit flavors. With full body, flavors of tomato and balsamic, it should be best with hearty and rich dishes."
DeLille,Bordeaux-style White Blend,90.5,37.33,6,"Crisp and flowery upon entry, this wine falls flat midpalate, offering a lopsided amount of ripe apple, pear and lemon curd that overpowers the more subtle aspects of minerality lurking in the background."
DeLille,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.56,96.0,9,This blend of Cinsault (75%) and Mourvèdre already seems quite advanced. Notes of raisined fruit and brown spices come along with light cranberry flavors that seem to have faded.
DeLille,Malbec,89.0,49.0,1,"This medium-bodied Bordeaux blend features deep spice, pepper and red cherry flavors. It's a soft wine with gentle tannins and a subtle overall character."
DeLille,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,55.0,1,"This wine doesn't have much going on. It's dried out, chalky in the mouth, stemmy and bitter with green tannins. The fruit is dried out and there is a scent of brett as well."
DeLille,Red Blend,91.25,56.75,4,"The Côte Est Pinot Noir is more structured and less immediately accessible than the winery's Rocheux bottling, but ultimately may prove to be the better bottle. It offers tightly woven, chewy fruit flavors of black cherry, black raspberry and plum, along with darker streaks of clove, leaf, smoke and earth. As always, the wine is structured with elegant precision."
DeLille,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,42.0,1,"Just 44 cases of this fragrant and elegant reserve were made from the estate vineyard's oldest vines; at 35 years of age they have the grace and sensuous elegance that only time can bring. Give the wine a few moments to open and up come sweet minty notes, chocolaty oak and rather delicate flavors of raspberry and pomegranate, struck against metal, mineral and earth."
DeLille,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,92.0,37.0,1,"The flavors are sappy and spicy and full, and the wine has a pleasing depth and richness. The fruits run through red and purple berries and lead into hints of chocolate and leaf. The winemaking is polished and confident, and yet Jacques Tardy has left just enough roughness in the flavors to give the wine personality and character. May be cellared for up to a decade."
DeLille,Syrah,92.0,42.0,2,"This wine is made from estate-grown grapes and a selection of clones, offering robust dark cherry and berry fruit spiked with cardamom, cola and black tea. Smooth and silky on the palate, it finishes with a trace of tart pomegranate and smoke."
DeLille,White Blend,92.0,25.0,1,"Cola spice dominates the nose of this thick, concentrated wine from the heart of Westside Road. Stemmy earth notes accompany its ripe red fruit, as toasted oak and vanilla flavors extend long into the finish."
DeLorimier,Cabernet Franc,88.0,43.0,1,"Big-boned and soft, this reserve-tier wine is savory and serene, with forest flavors of wild mushroom. Soy, dried herb, sage and black currant notes pepper the scene."
DeLorimier,Chardonnay,88.0,32.0,1,"This is an herbal, low-alcohol style. Tart wild berry, lemony citrus, fresh herbs and a streak of iron combine gracefully. This is a new trend in Oregon, emphasizing non-intervention, subtle detail, low alcohol and neutral oak, and here it's been done well."
DeLorimier,Meritage,89.0,42.0,2,"The aromas are alluring, with notes of stem, dried herb, white pepper, cigar box and raspberry. The palate is chock-full of raspberry flavors that show a pleasing purity, and the finish lingers, showing just a touch of heat."
DeLorimier,Primitivo,86.0,38.0,1,"Bright waves of cola and clove provide underlying spiciness and freshness to this thick, juicy wine. It explodes on the palate, with crisp red-fruit and orange-peel flavors."
DeLorimier,Red Blend,85.0,38.0,1,"Martin Woods wines are aged in Oregon oak, mostly neutral. This is exceptionally fragrant, with whiffs of violets, mint and body powder. Supple on the palate, those scents connect directly to flavors of rose petals, raspberries and red plums. The finish is as smooth and soft as the entry, with a gentle dusting of cocoa powder."
DeLorimier,Sangiovese,89.0,34.0,1,"Pale in the glass, this wine from the Jurassic Park Vineyard booms with clean and crisp tropical notes on the nose, showing poached pear, papaya, pineapple and gardenia aromas. Energetic acidity delivers its peach, mango and guava flavors, making for a potent but not treacly palate."
DeLorimier,Zinfandel,83.0,38.0,1,"This vintage shows cut grass, ripe apple, pear, wet cement and nectarine sorbet aromas in a wine that's almost as clear as water. The palate is textural and full of zip, with rainy day-like crispness and green fruit flavors."
DeTierra Vineyards,Chardonnay,92.0,40.0,1,"From a site in Green Valley, this crisp, light-bodied offering has a dusty rose aroma and a meaty consistency the provides body without weight. Cranberry and cherry notes form its fruit core, accompanied by a tease of grapefruit."
DeTierra Vineyards,Merlot,89.0,40.0,2,"This bright, light and acid-driven wine is juicy and fresh—a full embrace of tart lemon and tangerine flavors. Its liveliness is long-lived and welcome."
DeTierra Vineyards,Pinot Noir,94.0,52.0,1,"Smooth and oaky, with a soft and accessible appeal, this is a more limited production offering than the Chateau's regular Columbia Valley Chardonnay. Though undeniably charming, it thins out quickly and does not have the vivid complexity of its sibling."
DeTierra Vineyards,Red Blend,90.0,28.0,1,"This Livermore producer has sourced from Livermore and Amador County—both Portuguese varieties and Cabernet Sauvignon—to make this Port-style wine, a mouthful of caramel toffee melted and toasty. A hint of marshmallow's there too."
DeTierra Vineyards,Syrah,91.5,29.5,4,"Three quarters Sauvignon Blanc and the rest Sémillon, this attractive white wine has an appealing snap to the fruit and an underlying acidity that sets it up in lively fashion. It's a food wine through and through, lightly toasty, with green berries and apples providing the clean fruit flavors. A fine value."
Dealy Lane,Chardonnay,86.0,18.0,1,"Pure Merlot, from the Red Mountain vineyard, this displays that AVA's stiff, hard-edged tannins, keeping the fruit pinned down into a compact core. Cassis and black cherry, iron filings and some tar are all carefully balanced. There's plenty of muscle for further aging, and a hint of heat in the finish."
Deaver,Zinfandel,87.9,28.5,10,"There is a lovely balance to this Viognier, and a sense that these cool-climate grapes were not pushed too far. The winemaker, happily, chose to make the wine that the vineyard gave her. Delicate and layered, with paper-thin suggestions of citrus rind, grapefruit and white peach. Still tightly knit, this wine very slowly unwinds long after you've swallowed that first sip or two."
Decroux,Pinot Noir,92.0,75.0,6,"This full-bodied wine smells like black currants and blackberries, tastes ripe, and is lightly tannic to give it a little grip. Bring on the beef or pork tenderloin."
Ded.Reckoning,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,40.0,1,"Attractive sage and fresh-cut wood accents stay with this full-bodied, value-priced wine from the aroma to the finish. Generous, jammy fruit flavors fill in the middle. Extra time soaking with the grape skins helped make it delicious and spicy, mouthfilling and smooth."
Ded.Reckoning,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.38,50.0,8,"This wine delivers good value for its quality, a medium-bodied expression of ripe, exuberant honeycomb, baked pear and anise that is supported but never distracted by mellowed oak. Refreshing and balanced, it has moderate acidity and a luxurious mouthfeel."
Ded.Reckoning,Grenache,91.0,40.0,1,"100% varietal, this wine exhibits aromas of dried herb, cigar box, and cherry. The flavors are tart, light and elegant, harmonizing on the finish."
Ded.Reckoning,Malbec,86.67,30.0,3,"Rich, melt-in-the-mouth fruit flavors and a smooth, supple texture make this wine hard to resist. Black cherry and blueberry in the aromas and flavors get a little grip from light tannins on the palate."
Ded.Reckoning,Merlot,84.0,20.0,1,Lively fruit flavors and great balance make this wine easy to appreciate and a versatile pairing with food. Fresh cherry and raspberry aromas meet rich flavors on a smooth texture that has just enough light tannins for a little grip.
Deep Sea,Merlot,85.0,22.0,1,"This bottling of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre presents a dusty, slightly sweet-smelling nose, with blackberry syrup and leather aromas. Juicy blueberries and blackberries lead into a sip laced with licorice, tobacco and lava rock, finishing on a note of burnt caramel. It's quite dense so needs lots of time to open up."
Deep Sea,Syrah,89.0,38.0,1,"A fresh, grassy aroma and lively grapefruit and herb flavors give a lot of zest to this medium-bodied and almost peppery wine."
Deer Creek,Chardonnay,82.0,25.0,1,"Syrah makes up three-quarters of this wine with Grenache (20%) and Syrah accounting for the rest. It's fragrant with aromas of raspberry, cherry, herb and allspice that lead to plush, downright jammy fruit flavors that still show a deft touch."
Deer Creek,Pinot Noir,86.0,45.0,2,"Cigar box, café au lait, and dried tobacco aromas are followed by coffee and cherry flavors, with barrel spices lingering on the finish. The wood gets a bit out front but it still delivers enjoyment."
Deer Creek,White Blend,83.0,20.0,1,"Although the blend includes 20% Primitivo and 5% Petite Sirah, which might be expected to add some tannic muscle to the wine, this is a simple red quaffer, with light raspberry fruit and a hint of milk chocolate."
Deerfield,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,24.0,1,"The blend is 51% Nebbiolo and 49% Barbera. It's aromatically intriguing, with a whiff of Asian spices and a dusting of cocoa powder. Though almost four years old, it hasn't entirely jelled—it drinks like two different wines, one tart and acidic, with light red berry flavors; the other smooth and almost silky."
Deerfield Ranch,Rosé,88.0,20.0,2,"Tight and tart, this offers crisp and spicy flavors of raspberry fruit, with a sharpness to the flavors. About one-quarter of the barrels were new and deliver highlights of toast and chocolate."
Deerfield Ranch,Syrah,90.0,50.0,1,"A sniff of leather and limited fruit freshness detract this wine from reaching the level of the previous vintage. It's got some berry flavors and a bit of barrel toast and chocolate, but falls away quickly. Two bottles tasted."
Deering,Red Blend,86.0,45.0,1,"This smells like sweet red cherries and ripe plums and tastes quite ripe, almost sweet, with more berries and cherries. The overall mouthfeel is full bodied and the texture is broad and rich. It is generous, fruity and tasty all around."
Deering,Zinfandel,85.0,42.0,1,"Wafts of campfire smoke, vanilla bean and wet granite greet the nose. The palate shows lemon-lime soda and hard caramel candies, with a touch of bitterness. It's clean and well made, but not too showy."
Dehlinger,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,55.0,1,"Named after the redwood tank where the first Riboli family vintners stored their best wine a century ago, this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 16% Petit Verdot and 14% Malbec shows blueberry and slate minerality on the nose, alongside licorice and mint spices. The palate is overwhelmed by tannins, though black pepper, tobacco and charred meat flavors emerge."
Dehlinger,Chardonnay,95.0,40.0,1,"This blend of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache offers heady and thick violet and plum extract aromas, and smells heavier in alcohol than it is. The palate shows ripe black cherry, but it's eye-wateringly tannic, and needs quite a bit of time in the cellar to evolve."
Dehlinger,Pinot Noir,93.5,60.25,4,"This savory, salty and oaky white offers flavors of baked and dried apple and butterscotch. Medium to full bodied, it's a strong wine firm in tannin, with its sense of ripeness peaking on the finish."
Dehlinger,Syrah,91.0,46.5,4,"This simple, rich white wine features a cheesecake graphic on the label, hence the name. The blend is a mix of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling and Gewürztraminer. Fine for sipping cold if you're in the mood for a more luscious white."
Del Carlo Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,30.0,2,"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and four other grapes, this toasty red will please anyone who likes a red wine with satiny, milk chocolate goodness. The fruit and mouth-coating barrel flavors are fine, though there is just a hint of a green edge to the tannins."
Del Carlo Winery,Zinfandel,90.0,32.0,2,"This new cuvée features grapes from both Tokar and Yellowbird vineyards, located out in the Mill Creek region east of downtown Walla Walla. It's close enough to the Blue Mountains to allow for this experiment in dry-farmed (non-irrigated) grapes. Flavors are distinctive, showing wild berries, cola, grain and herb."
Del Rio,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,35.0,1,"Borra winemaker Markus Niggli, a Swiss native, has gone back to his roots for this innovative blend of 85% Kerner and 15% Riesling, proving that some of the best experimentation in California is happening in places like Lodi right now. Full of lively acidity, this wine is crisp, soft, sparkling with lime, apple, lychee and kiwi, easy to enjoy on a summer's day or any other day."
Del Rio,Cabernet Franc,82.0,32.0,1,"Pale copper colored, this wine is more focused on mineral than fruit expression, with aromas of wet stone out in front of citrus rind. The medium-bodied flavors dance lightly on the palate but still show concentration, texture and balance."
Del Rio,Cabernet Sauvignon,83.0,28.0,1,"Light aromas of wet stone, smoke, stone fruit and white flowers lead to ethereally light yet sweet and flavorful peach notes. It's a very pretty and compelling expression of the variety."
Del Rio,Merlot,83.0,28.0,2,"This wine pops with aromas of orange peel, raspberry, herb and clove. The jammy fruit flavors are pure in feel and linger on the finish."
Del Rio,Pinot Gris,86.5,16.0,2,"Holding 42% Mourvèdre, 31% Cinsault and 27% Grenache, this full-bodied wine has aromas of peppery spices, herbs and jammy red and black fruit. Flavors are sweet and ripe, with restrained oak."
Del Rio,Pinot Noir,83.0,28.0,1,"This blend of Primitivo (43%), Petite Sirah (28%) and Zinfandel offers aromas of blackberry jam, plum, dried fruit and baking spices. It's full bodied and palate coating with high-octane fruit flavors that linger."
Del Rio,Syrah,82.0,35.0,1,"Winemaker Adam Henkel inherited this vintage's barrels, but puts together a tasty blend, showing cracked peppercorns, obsidian-like rocks, layers of blackberry and a slight hint of green pepper. Pasilla chile opens the palate, which unfolds with boysenberry and blackberry, staying evenly balanced the entire sip."
Del Rio,Viognier,86.5,20.0,2,"Deeply orange-mauve in color, this wine tastes much like the Pinot Noir it came from, with rich aromas of buttered cherries, clove and allspice. A similar familiarity carries through the sip, with dark raspberries, red cherries, brown spice and sandalwood elements, perfect for Pinot-philes."
Delectus,Cabernet Sauvignon,82.0,107.5,2,"Dark gold in color, this is a viscous, ripe and creamy white, layered in minerality and fresh-cut stone fruit. From a mighty mountainous vineyard, it offers bold, full-bodied flavor and texture, a testament to its site, and finishes big in juicy Golden Delicious apple and pear."
Delectus,Red Blend,85.0,165.0,1,"A more restrained style from Brian Loring, this conveys aromas of plump blackberry and plums surrounding a line of licorice. The palate is a bit thicker, with black cherry flavors lifted by bergamot-like citrus skins and chopped herbs."
Delectus,Sauvignon Blanc,83.0,30.0,1,"This is becoming a golden age for quality, value-oriented Oregon Pinot Noir. But within that broad category, there are very few single-vineyard, Willamette Valley entries. Add this to the list. All Pommard clone, 30% new French oak, and a pale, lovely shade of rose, this brings substantial berry, root beer, earth and iron flavors into play. Complex and refined, it has subtle power."
Delfino,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,89.0,25.0,1,"For a superripe and full-bodied wine this also has good, firm tannins to beef up the texture and balance all the sweet ripe berry and cherry flavors. There are touches of clove and anise in the aroma, and a cocoa-like flavor on the finish."
Delfino,Tempranillo,87.0,35.0,1,"The ripeness is evident in the full-bodied, round fruit flavors of plum and black cherry. Gentle suggestions of clean earth, graphite and coffee grounds bring up further flavor notes as it winds through the finish."
Della,Chardonnay,94.0,70.0,1,"Coming from seven vineyards and showing more yellow, orange and tan than pink in the glass, this blend of 80% Grenache, 17% Mourvèdre and 3% Counoise suggests orange and lemon peels, just-sliced melon and frozen strawberries on the nose. The palate is more about great acidity and a stony minerality, along with some watermelon elements and orange rind."
Della,Pinot Noir,92.33,70.0,6,"These vines date back to the mid-1970s and were originally planted by Dick Erath. This is their final vintage, as they've been removed. As a last hurrah it's a fine one, an intriguing melding of floral, mint and citrus components. With 13g/L residual sugar, it's just slightly off dry, with good palate penetration and superior length."
Delmas,Syrah,93.5,65.0,2,"This is the second release showcasing this old-school clone. It works well as a stand-alone cuvée, with brawny and broad flavors of plum and black cherry. There's a whiff of compost and some savory notes also, but it's mainly the big-boned fruit that shines here."
Demetria,G-S-M,89.0,25.0,1,"The vineyard is one of the youngest at the winery, and the flavors reflect that, with bright, fruity, forward raspberry notes. It's lightly spiked with sweet baking spices, and makes a perfectly delicious choice while waiting for some of the winery's bigger, bolder 2012s to age a bit further."
Demetria,Grenache,91.0,60.0,1,"Zenith is the winery's estate vineyard, and represents a particularly fine value in a splendid lineup. The ripe, plummy fruit is swathed in rich brown spices, a sweet streak of molasses, and notes of tobacco and black tea. Decant and enjoy immediately, or cellar for another couple of years to let the flavors continue melding."
Demetria,Pinot Noir,92.25,61.5,4,"Bone dry indeed, and searingly tart as well, this is loaded with complex, deeply inscribed flavors of fruit, stone and rind. Citrus is the highlight—a compelling mix of lime, grapefruit and orange peel. The finish is world class. Drink now through 2025."
Demetria,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,47.0,2,"A small-production offering from the grower-producer, this is a restrained take on the variety, lightly bodied and ripened, with juicy acidity at its core. Cherry, earth and a tension of dried herb complement each other on the palate, before a lengthy finish of white pepper draped in violets closes things out."
Demetria,Rhône-style White Blend,90.0,34.5,2,"A wondrous array of blackberry, pepper, dried meat, soft lavender, well-integrated lilac and crushed graphite show on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard planted in 2008. A firm but not overpowering tannic structure and bright acidity present flavors of dried violets, blueberry and tar on the palate."
Demetria,Syrah,91.0,43.0,1,"The blend is 59% Merlot, 33% Syrah, and 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, and the flavors mix well. There's some not unpleasant volatile acidity and very tart, tangy red fruit flavors. All nicely integrated, and drinking pleasantly right now."
Demetria,Viognier,88.0,30.0,1,"Forward and spicy, this puts some muscle into the Merlot with earthy, tongue-gripping tannins. The fruit has a sweet tomato flavor, with a streak of cherry candy. Though not entirely knit together, it's a pleasant drink best enjoyed young."
Den Hoed,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,80.0,8,"The estate's top Bordeaux blend, it's full-bodied and inviting, a vibrant bowl-full of red and black fruits, laced with baking spices. A worthy follow-up to the winery's outstanding 2004, this fruit-driven, well-balanced and flat-out bodacious style of winemaking should have enormous consumer appeal. Can it improve in the cellar? Give it five years to find out."
Den Hoed,Red Blend,91.17,80.0,6,"This has a gorgeous nose redolent with dried spices and hints of incense. The moderate (13.8%) alcohol is a joy, and the use of oak (half new) is just right. The Cabernet character comes through, with a slightly herbal/black olive edge, but it is wrapped in toast and sweet baking spices, and balanced through a very smooth and surprisingly long finish."
Dennen,Sparkling Blend,88.0,30.0,1,"This is all Lewis Vineyard Cabernet, though not as strong as the vineyard-designated bottling from the same vintage. There is noticeable volatility in the opening aromas, which slowly blows off and turns into concentrated raspberry, boysenberry, plum and cherry compote fruit. Dense and buoyed with firm acids, this wine needs a full 24 hours to smooth out. There is plenty of well-managed oak, adding smoky coffee and espresso to the finish."
Derby,Albariño,87.0,24.0,2,"Aromatic, chocolaty and deliciously smooth, the Sheridan vineyard bottling sends up sweet scents of ground coffee and chocolate. Compact fruit flavors of fig and black cherry run right into a bourbon barrel finish, with granular tannins that add welcome texture and a streak of graphite."
Derby,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,34.0,2,"This is a buttery style of Chardonnay, but done deliciously. Aromas of clotted cream, browned butter, vanilla custard, sea-salt caramel, roasted almonds and cashews meet with fresh lemon and apple-blossom touches on the chalky nose. The palate is very grippy with Meyer lemon and lime pith, but then reveals creamy flavors of clarified butter on toast."
Derby,Pinot Gris,91.0,20.0,1,"An amazing wine for less than $30, this bottling by veteran Winemaker Dan Lee starts with tightly wound aromas of dried yogurt, Meyer lemon peel, honeysuckle and Asian-pear flesh. Great grapefruit-pith flavors kick off the sip, where lime juice and baking soda combine for a tight, bright, grippy, laser-focused and high-toned palate."
Derby,Pinot Noir,92.0,37.0,2,"Funk Estate (60%) and Watermill vineyards—both in The Rocks District—make up this wine. It's initially aromatically brooding with high-toned notes of stems, green herbs, coffee, funk and mineral, with generous floral notes providing accents. The palate is rounded and full, with fruit and savory flavors intertwining, showing a very pretty precision. The finish is lengthy."
Derby,Red Blend,91.75,31.0,4,"This blend of 50% Grenache, 33% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is quite a delicious and full package. The nose is pretty yet also dense and brawny, with aromas of baked black plum, wild blackberry, leather, sagebrush and lightly roasted coffee. There is lots of chalky texture on the palate and a pointed acidity, presenting exotic flavors of plum, mulberry, pepper spice and a touch of nutmeg."
Derby,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,30.0,2,"Mexican lime, crushed chalk, light jasmine, daffodil and lemon-lime soda show on the nose of this bottling by veteran Steve Dooley. Tight cement and lime-rind flavors pop on the palate, where a sharp kumquat quality dissects the Bosc-pear warmth and the nuanced influence of damp dill and other green herbs."
Derby,Rhône-style White Blend,89.5,24.0,2,"Salty lemon and ripe apple aromas combine for a very inviting nose that also shows pineapple and creamy lily scents on this bottling from a historic vineyard. A fine line of gunmetal tension runs down the middle of the palate, which opens toward a fuller-bodied wine with lots of lemon peel and butter flavors as well as a nicely chalky mouthfeel."
Derby,Rosé,87.0,20.0,1,"A partnership between Ken Forrester and Sonoma County--based winemaker Jesse Katz, this 100% varietal wine comes from a single block of a rocky, hillside site that Katz also sources for his delicious Devil Proof Malbec. Creamy, concentrated waves of vanilla and cherry, with just a hint of almond, open the way to high-toned structure and integrated tannin and oak, finishing balanced and bright."
Derby,White Blend,91.0,24.0,1,"Ripe and plump blackberries shine through in a showcase of fruit purity, lifted by dried fennel, hot black gravel, peppercorns, toasted sesame and soy. There is tremendous structure and acidity on the sip, with black pepper and black-sesame nuance plus juicy boysenberry character to the midpalate."
Des Voigne Cellars,Merlot,89.0,28.0,1,"A warm and welcoming yet light dusting of vanilla lifts the Marcona almonds, honey, buttered toast and white peach on the nose of this bottling from the brand formerly known as La Fenetre. Cashew nuts pop on the palate alongside brown butter, lemon peels, salt and light caramel flavors, all in utter balance."
Des Voigne Cellars,Red Blend,87.67,28.33,3,"This study of St. Emilion-style wines shows a density of blackberry and blueberry fruit as well as bittersweet fudge and concentrated lilacs, proving both showy yet elegant. The palate is expertly layered with rich blackcurrant, milk chocolate, mocha and graphite flavors. This one is ready to drink now."
Des Voigne Cellars,Sangiovese,89.0,26.0,1,"Very focused Key-lime aromas meet with strongly earthy, wet-clay scents on the nose of this wine that also offers a subtle minty kick. The palate is citrus-driven, with kumquat and tangerine flavors that give way to a warmer cream element before settling on a tense pink-grapefruit pith element."
Des Voigne Cellars,Syrah,86.0,30.0,2,"A consistent stunner vintage after vintage, this elevated Cabernet is velvety smooth and exotically laced in coconut, cola and clove. Mouthfilling and succulent, it's high-toned in approach and balance, despite a fierce concentration of black fruit. The highlights are vanilla, clove and dried herb."
Desert Wind,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,20.0,1,"Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot inform the full-bodied flavors in this stunner. It shines in its luxuriously velvety texture, bright red fruit and intriguing elements of graphite and tar. Big and bold, it betrays its size with unexpectedly elegant tension and focus."
Desert Wind,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,18.0,1,"Made from the best four barrels of the vintage, this bottling shows an intriguing nose of soy and hoisin sauce, fresh-pressed blackberries, star anise and sandalwood. A similarly Asian-spiced character shows on the delicious palate, where nutmeg and clove meet with more blackberry fruit, black pepper, crushed herbs and a touch of caramel."
Desert Wind,Chardonnay,86.0,15.0,1,"A spicy, blackberry Petite marked by stewed plums, anise and tar."
Desert Wind,Malbec,87.0,30.0,1,"A cedary, slightly chemical aroma masks the fruit, and it is barrel flavors, more than berry flavors, that flood the palate. Overall it's a smooth, modestly-proportioned Merlot that's ready for near-term drinking."
Desert Wind,Merlot,85.0,18.0,3,"Made using fruit that was sourced from 30- and 40-year-old plantings, this has captivating flavors of black cherry and cassis, wrapped in brambly hints of herb. It shows plenty of intense power, with many more layers surfacing with breathing time. In fact, it's just as good on its second day."
Desert Wind,Red Blend,86.0,22.67,3,"Winemaker Flint Nelson co-ferments this unusual Mourvèdre with Syrah and Grenache, yielding a wine with unusually smooth integration of flavors. Multifaceted and supple, this has layers of ripe fruit, spice, lead pencil, cedar and clean earth flavors, which continue smoothly onto the medium-long finish."
Desert Wind,Viognier,86.0,15.0,1,"This is 98% Syrah, unlike past vintages where it was modeled after a Côtes du Rhône-style blend. It opens with enticing whiffs of soft leather and toasted nut, before bringing in a smooth mix of black and purple fruits, along with chocolate and anise highlights. It's supple and proportionate, with polished, coffee-flavored tannins."
Deuce,Syrah,86.0,40.0,2,"This is a hot, ripe, extracted style that will be quite appealing to many consumers. However, the volatile high-toned scents and the hot edge from the excess alcohol make it a tough match for food."
Devil Proof,Malbec,94.33,118.33,3,"Aromas of banana, melon and lemon curd are bright and effusive. The tropical aromas carry on to the sleekly styled flavors that narrow toward the finish."
Devil's Advocate,Red Blend,86.0,22.0,1,"A rich golden color, mild peach and herbal aromas and rather savory, almost meaty flavors make a tasty combination in this dry, full-bodied and distinctive wine. Blended from Tocai, Riesling, Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc, it has good acidity and an attractively robust mouthfeel."
Devium,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,34.0,1,"This blend of 30% Viognier, 30% Grenache Blanc, 17% Picpoul Blanc, 17% Roussanne and 6% Marsanne offers hints of honeycomb and yellow apple on the nose. Green apple, bruised pear and salted nectarine flavors show on the palate."
Devona,Pinot Noir,91.0,50.0,2,"This strong dessert wine is made from 100% Petite Sirah grapes from a particular site and was bottled in 2013. Salty, mushroom and earth aromas drift upward from the glass followed by a thickness of sour-sweet dark chocolate and raisins."
Di Arie,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,39.0,1,"Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and aged just over 10 years in barrel, Noble Companion is thick and hot, opening with a tawny taste of roasted pecans, viscous on the palate. It was bottled in 2015."
Di Arie,Petite Sirah,88.0,30.0,1,"Smooth and well balanced, this medium-bodied wine combines light cinnamon and cherry aromas with rich plum flavors. It has a good harmony between bright acidity and ripe fruitiness."
Di Arie,Red Blend,86.0,30.0,2,"Fresh plum, blackberry, loamy earth and tobacco leaf elements shine on the nose of this bottling from the Uvas Canyon area between Morgan Hill and Gilroy. It's straightforward on the palate with decent acidity and a light body presenting plum paste, anise and cedar flavors."
Di Arie,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,18.0,1,"Fresh-crushed red currant aromas mix with dried purple flowers and mocha on the nose of this bottling. The flavors are very evenly presented, ripe and round with black plum fruit and a touch of fig-laced balsamic vinegar."
Di Arie,Syrah,89.0,30.0,1,"This appears to be a wine that's simply over-reached. Noticeably high-toned, with a vinegary bite to the cherry flavored fruit, it's pushed it a bit too far. Not even 28 months in three quarters new French oak can mask the volatility."
Di Arie,Tempranillo,92.0,30.0,2,"The convergence of high alcohol, acidity and tannin will make this Super Tuscan-style blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot last quite a while. Intense plum brandy aromas meet nose-tickling licorice notes on the nose while the palate's grippy tannins present vanilla, cherry, blackberry and candied lilac flavors. Drink 2018–2028."
Di Arie,Zinfandel,86.0,24.0,2,"This wine from the sought-after site opens with spice, salty brine and a light imprint of acidity. It shows prominent preserved lemon and crisp green apple notes, as well as more developed layers of peach. The oak is well integrated and helpful to the whole, adding texture and weight."
DiStefano,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.67,29.17,6,"This 50–50 blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon shows elegant layers of black currant, blackberry, purple flower, milk chocolate, anise and vanilla aromas. The palate is rich, thick and deep, with brooding yet well-integrated black fruit and hearty spice notes."
DiStefano,Cabernet Franc,85.0,25.0,1,"This is the winery's reserve, made just twice previously, in 2010 and 2012. Production is up sharply, and it's a ripe, round fruit pie of a wine, best enjoyed while still young. Red fruits and citrus are in the mix, with a touch of papaya. It was aged 14 months in French oak, two-thirds of it new."
DiStefano,Red Blend,86.5,56.5,2,"Robust tannins support bold swathes of leather, garrigue and dried herb notes in this complex, savory wine. Dark and brooding, it has a snap of fresh cherry, raspberry and orange fruit that lifts its denser aspects of brambly berry, meat and tobacco."
DiStefano,Syrah,87.0,28.0,1,"Aromatic and stylish, this Dijon-clone Chardonnay jumps out with sweet spices on the nose and a floral twist to the palate. Pollen, apple and white-peach flavors punch through into a well-balanced, lingering finish. It drinks nicely already but should continue to improve through 2023."
Diamond Creek,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.9,212.5,10,"This old-vine Riesling matches medium sweetness (25g/L) to ample acidity. It's a dense and flavorful style, taut and fleshy at the same time. The peachy fruit hints at ripe banana as well, with a lick of butterscotch adorning the finish. Drink now through 2022."
Diamond Ridge Vineyards,Rosé,85.0,10.0,1,"This rosé brings extra levels of finesse and detail along with the expected burst of fresh fruit. Elegant and sophisticated, it offers tart cherry fruit, some peppery herb and a hint of fresh-ground coffee. Barrel fermented in neutral oak, it's smooth as silk."
Diatom,Chardonnay,91.75,40.5,4,"Round rather than racy, this fruity effort rings out with peach, melon and papaya flavors. It's finished dry with just 4g/L residual sugar, and the delicious finish has a honeysuckle note."
Dierberg,Chardonnay,91.0,32.0,1,"Sage and anise characterize the nose of this single-vineyard offering. On the palate, there is a distinct element of elderberry, a native fruit to the Central Coast, as well as the expected balance between slightly grippy tannins and a bright acidity."
Dierberg,Pinot Noir,90.57,46.29,7,"From an organically-farmed hillside vineyard planted to the Old Wente clone, this white is expressive in oak and intense aromas and flavors of delicate pear, peach and lime. Made in a fuller, creamy style, it's balanced in acidity with a crispness to the finish."
Dierberg,Syrah,88.0,34.0,1,"It conveys Asian influences, with lemongrass leading the nose alongside chalkiness, lemon curd and soft peach. Those elements power the palate too, with lemongrass, Thai basil and coconut milk framed by yellow grapefruit acidity and Chinese spice. Serve with pho."
Dilecta,G-S-M,93.0,46.0,1,"If you like a bigger, broader style, with plenty of toast and buttery goodness, this is the one for you. It spent a year in one-quarter new barrels, another eight months in neutral oak. Oily, buttery and loaded with ripe peach, pear and pineapple fruit, it's a wine to drink chilled and early, while it retains all of its innate freshness."
Dilecta,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,46.0,1,"There's a unique and pleasing savory character to the nose of this wine, like a just-seared filet mignon. On the palate, it's quite smooth, with rich plum, tart cherry and dark chocolate flavors, making for a complex yet quality sipping experience."
Dilecta,Syrah,92.0,46.0,1,"Tar and rich black cherries form the nose of this wine sourced from a vineyard planted in 1997. Luscious red fruit begins the palate, supported in the midpalate and finish by black pepper and fennel seed. It makes for a very approachable but complex, spice-driven wine."
Dilecta,Syrah-Mourvèdre,91.0,46.0,1,"M.C.K. stands for Motor City Kitty, and along with the winery's Milbrandt Syrah, this is the entry-level offering in a vast portfolio of single vineyard bottlings. Tasty, toasty, supple and fruity, this carries slight hints of citrus, earth and stem and wraps its appealing, forward flavors in a light coating of milk chocolate."
Dion,Pinot Noir,90.75,40.0,4,"Lemberger, also known as Blaufränkisch, was planted here in the 1970s—the winery believes it was the first commercial bottling in the country. This is a seriously good wine, worthy of special attention. It could be mistaken for a particularly fine country wine from Italy, southern France or Spain, with its old vine complexity, red and blue fruits and whiff of tanned leather."
Diora,Pinot Noir,92.0,30.0,3,"This lovely blend of Sauvignon Blanc, and 14% Roussanne, is as crisp and fresh as its name implies. Bright fruit flavors of lemon, lime, orange and pineapple speak to the success of this unusual blend. It's a bracing, palate-cleansing white wine that will be appealing all year round."
Diora,Red Blend,91.0,28.33,3,"Here's a good, clean effort, not showing entirely bone dry but enough for the moniker. Mixed citrus, notably lime, green apple and spicy notes dominate, in a wine with excellent balance and a welcome touch of minerality."
Director's Cut,Zinfandel,85.0,40.0,1,"An appealing wine with notes of dark fruit and sweet spices. It's broad in feel with the dry, grippy tannins the only thing holding it back."
District 7 Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,20.0,1,"An aromatic wine with barrel notes of toast, chocolate, and licorice alongside pepper and plum. It's tart and expansive with a soft, velvety feel and a cherry liqueur-filled finish."
Diversion,Red Blend,85.0,16.0,2,"The deep color matches the bold grapy flavors. With a touch of sweetness, soft texture and syrupy balance, this will chase down a spicy burrito or kung pao chicken."
Diversion,Riesling,88.0,17.0,1,"A smooth, earthy wine, this smells a bit like tobacco and cedar, tastes mellow and meaty, and has enough tannin and acidity for a firm texture."
Division,Gamay Noir,88.0,27.0,1,"Blended with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, this Merlot is floral in aroma but lacking in fruit on the palate. A bitter herbal character develops toward the finish."
Dobbes Family Estate,Grenache Blanc,89.33,26.0,3,"Grenache (56%) takes the lead on this blend, which also includes Syrah, Mourvèdre, Counoise and Cinsault. It offers aromas of celery salt, coffee and dark berries. The palate brings fruit flavors that display the best this vintage has to offer—richness without excessive weight. The finish persists."
Dobbes Family Estate,Pinot Noir,88.58,49.67,12,"A unique blend of Syrah (78%), Cabernet Sauvignon (13%) and Mourvèdre, this low-alcohol wine (for the vintage and region) offers aromas of high-toned dried herbs, earth, smoked meat, smoke and white pepper. The citrusy fire-pit flavors are elegant and show persistence. It's a unique expression of the area that should do well on the dinner table."
Dobbes Family Estate,Syrah,90.0,50.0,1,"This blend of Syrah (58%), Merlot (33%) and Malbec (9%) offers immediate appeal, with ready-to-go aromas of raspberry compote, mocha and cranberries. The polished red-fruit flavors show depth."
Dois Irmãos,Pinot Noir,91.0,45.0,1,"A zesty nose of blackberry and mint also shows elements of plum, pencil lead and eucalyptus leaf in this single-vineyard exploration. The food-friendly, earthy and minerally palate offers more pencil lead as well as black pepper, coriander and thyme."
Dolin,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,46.0,2,"An layered nose shows pan-fried apples, caramelized pears, just-ripe banana, roasted chicken and slight quinine aromas. The palate starts tropical and fat, with banana and mango flavors, but settles into a smoked, oaky-apple groove, hinged to steely tension."
Dolin,Chardonnay,92.0,39.0,4,"Baking soda, ripe citrus pith, lime blossoms and a soft petrol touch show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard to watch in southern San Luis Obispo County. Tons of sprinkling acidity shows once sipped, with the nervy palate offering orange oil, lemon pith and peel, chamomile, goldenseal root and sunflower-seed flavors."
Dolin,Pinot Noir,90.33,37.33,3,"This bottling, an ode to Bill Foley's Texas roots, is reserved on the nose with hints of yellow melon, peach blossom and a kiss of vanilla. The palate is straightforward and very drinkable, with seared brown pear and sea-salt flavors cruising across lemon-pith texture and a chalky grip."
Domaine Carneros,Chardonnay,93.0,77.0,2,"Champoux and Ciel du Cheval vineyards each make up 40% of this wine, with the balance coming from Gamache. It's locked-up tightly at present with earth, tar, cherry, high-toned herb and barrel-spice aromas leading to focused black-fruit flavors that display elegance and persistence. Give it time to open up."
Domaine Carneros,Pinot Noir,88.75,59.12,8,"The pencil lead, herb and vanilla aromas start out light and elusive. The black-cherry flavors, in contrast, are expressive, showing a good sense of balance and length."
Domaine Carneros,Sparkling Blend,92.0,35.0,1,"From a high perch on Howell Mountain, this producer has blended 92% Cabernet Sauvignon with 8% Petit Verdot—making for a darkly colored, robust wine. Thick, chalky tannins envelop plum, cassis and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2020."
Domaine Chandon,Sparkling Blend,91.0,45.0,2,"This tastes a bit over-cropped; the varietal character is there, but it's a pale rendition. Lightly peppery and grassy, with hints of citrus and very green apple fruit. Straightforward and simple."
Domaine Degher,Red Blend,88.0,42.0,1,"Coconut-laden oak kicks off the entry of this wine, a crisp version of the variety that nonetheless exhibits plenty of oak characteristics and a rich ripeness of baked apple, pear and pineapple."
Domaine Degher,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,48.0,1,"Floral and inviting in vanilla and caramel, this wine tastes bigger and richer than it is, offering more in the way of ripeness and texture than acidity. It finishes full bodied."
Domaine Drouhin,Chardonnay,92.67,45.0,3,"Opulently dense, this wine opens nicely in orange blossom and caramel apple, followed by a palate that's somewhat incomplete in fruit-flavor follow-up. Concentrated and full bodied, it packs a powerful punch, ending in oak."
Domaine Drouhin,Pinot Noir,95.0,45.0,1,"A mix of 37% Zinfandel, 32% Syrah and 31% Petite Sirah, this is a burly, thick and syrupy concoction from a high-elevation vineyard site known for its power and concentration. Sweet vanilla rides a dense wave of tannin and oak, finishing tight and leathery."
Domaine Drouhin Oregon,Chardonnay,93.5,50.75,4,"Sharply etched in pineapple and Meyer lemon, this wine retains a brightness of fruit and acidity throughout, never overly impeded by oak. A subtle, earthy herbal streak plays in the background."
Domaine Drouhin Oregon,Pinot Noir,93.57,62.14,7,"Light green-apple fruit and gentle highlights of cinnamon are in place, though this wine feels a little flat on the palate. A quick finish brings a hint of plastic."
Domaine J. Meuret,Chardonnay,92.5,37.5,2,"Succulent apricot and creamy vanilla add to the round, full-bodied expression of this robust white wine, the Sémillon blended with 15% Sauvignon Blanc from a single vineyard. A thickness of caramel and more vanilla rises on the finish."
Domaine J. Meuret,Pinot Noir,93.5,42.0,2,"Cooked plums, ripe strawberries, cola and a bit of clove make for an interesting nose on this bottling from a reliable and widely accessible producer. The palate shows slate, rust and pencil shavings as well as nutmeg and sour cranberries."
Domaine Loubejac,Chardonnay,86.0,16.0,1,"Pinot Grigio has yet to find a distinguishing style in Washington State. This is borderline generic, almost beery, a plain, pleasant, fairly neutral white wine with a mix of white peaches and green apples."
Domaine Loubejac,Pinot Noir,84.0,20.0,2,"A special reserve from the producer's vineyard designate of Stagecoach, this wine is layered and full bodied in red licorice and generous oak. Soft, integrated tannins wrap around an herbal underscore that's further cradled in cherry and chocolate."
Domaine Meriwether,Sparkling Blend,85.0,18.0,2,"A very deep color, unusually concentrated flavors and a thick blanket of tannins make this medium-bodied wine something to marvel at. It smells and tastes like black pepper, beef au jus, dark chocolate and blueberries, never gets too coarse, and has a long finish."
Domaine Pouillon,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,35.5,2,"A fresh, zesty bottling very much in the style of Chablis, this bottling by Clarissa Nagy shows steely minerality on the nose alongside sharp green apple, Anjour pear, scratched lime and white lily notes. The racy, apple-driven palate is bolstered by lemongrass and cut-lawn flavors, showing a shred of passion fruit as well."
Domaine Pouillon,G-S-M,86.0,24.0,1,"Though replanted, the vines designated for this bottling were taken from cuttings of the original vineyard blocks dating back to the early 1970s. Pretty in color, aroma and overall balance, this offers substantial black cherry fruit at its core, buttressed with barrel flavors of cacao. The wine shows good penetration and power, helped by aging 16 months in 38% new barrels."
Domaine Pouillon,Gewürztraminer,86.0,17.0,1,"Concentrated and slightly reserved at the same time, this deep-colored and full-bodied wine shows outstanding blackberry and blueberry flavors and a mouth-coating texture of fine-grained tannins. Still, it is not overripe, over oaked or over done, but is strong and beautifully balanced."
Domaine Pouillon,Red Blend,84.0,20.0,1,"Meaty, savory aromas, and lush, dense cherry and berry flavors put a lot of personality into this medium-bodied, ripe and luxurious-feeling wine. It's effusive enough to fill the mouth and satisfy the taste buds, but still dry enough for great balance."
Domaine Pouillon,Roussanne,87.0,26.0,1,"Lemon, lime and guava surround rounded acidity in this complex and layered white, fleshy and impressive in its approachability. This shows the ripe minerality of the appellation well, with just a wink of lushness on the finish."
Domaine Pouillon,Roussanne-Viognier,85.0,24.0,1,"A formidable expression of a high-elevation vineyard atop what is now known as Moon Mountain, this wine opens with a definitive note of spicy cinnamon stick before venturing into cherry and vanilla. Soft, likable and well-managed in terms of tannin and oak, it finishes rich and robust."
Domaine Pouillon,White Blend,88.0,17.0,1,"From a larger portion of viticulturist Anne Moller-Racke's home vineyard, this wine needs time to unravel itself out of a compact and concentrated funk of cedar and mint. The tannin weight is present and powerful. Roses and wild raspberries form a pact of flavor and beguiling aromatic invitation."
Domaine Serene,Chardonnay,92.37,75.33,27,"Concentrated fruit aromas, deep fruit flavors and a supportive, nicely astringent mouthfeel give this wine a great sense of structure and depth. It balances generosity with a bit of reserve in a traditional way that's very appealing. Best through 2020."
Domaine Serene,Pinot Noir,92.22,88.25,40,"Rich cherry jam, dew-covered thyme and a touch of licorice show on this bottling from a vineyard on the eastern fringe of the Sta. Rita Hills. Round red fruits and an anise character show right away on the palate, which grows more complex with pencil lead, cinnamon and dried herbs."
Domaine Serene,Pinot Noir-Syrah,93.0,80.0,1,"Powerful scents of toast and buttered popcorn dominate the nose, but once in the mouth the wine shows some grip and depth. For those who love the buttery style of Chardonnay, this will be hard to beat at this price. Traces of apple and pear fruit show in the midpalate, and the wine lingers gracefully into a full-bodied finish."
Domaine Serene,Red Blend,92.0,85.0,1,"This appealing Bordeaux blend opens with seductive mocha and milk chocolate aromas, threaded with cedar and toast. The fruit stands up to the wood, with pretty berry and rhubarb flavors. Extra bottle age has smoothed it out."
Domaine Serene,Rosé,90.5,35.0,4,"With oak aging providing a toasty top note, this dry, 100% varietal wine brings notes of apricot and spice. Despite the alcohol level, the concentration seems a bit wanting, and it doesn't all quite knit together."
Domaine Ste. Michelle,Chardonnay,88.0,20.0,1,"This solid if standard Pinot Noir proffers raspberry, earthiness, herbs and a touch of leather on the nose. The palate comes on silky but winds up fairly tannic by the finish. Wait until 2015 and this will be a much better wine."
Domaine Ste. Michelle,Sparkling Blend,86.33,13.5,6,"Randall Grahm notes that this is one of his best Syrahs from this historic vineyard, and it's hard to disagree. Aromas of gravel, just-crushed peppercorns and blueberries lead into a lighter, airy, mineral-driven palate of black rocks, black pepper and boysenberry fruit. It's one of the better cool-climate Syrahs around right now."
Domaine Ste. Michelle,White Blend,87.0,11.0,1,"A multidimensional wine, this delicious example made from 130-year-old vines combines depth, breadth and length. It smells like ripe blackberries, tastes fruity and layered, feels luxurious and supple but at the same time firm in fine tannins and balanced by lively acidity. Medium to full bodied, it tastes great now and will improve through 2020."
Domaine de la Cote,Pinot Noir,92.5,80.0,2,"Squeezed Key lime, kumquat rinds, light Marcona almond and a steel-driven minerality show on the nose of this wine, which comes from a vineyard planted in 1982. It's tightly wound on the palate though amazingly expressive with yellow lime flavors."
Domaine de la Terre Rouge,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,18.0,1,"The lovely label does not deceive—this is a quality product from package to palate. It's expressively aromatic, as Pinot should be, with rose petals, orange peel, raspberries and cherries. That clean, pure fruit gains weight as it carries into a lingering finish, streaked with white chocolate and supported with perfect acidity."
Domaine de la Terre Rouge,Syrah,94.0,80.0,1,"This hedonistically powerful mix of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot traffics in blackberry and black cherry jam over a layer of soft tannins. Coffee, toffee and subtle Asian and cinnamon spice keep the proceedings lively, for this is a seriously ripe and playful wine. Cellar through 2020."
Domenico,Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,28.0,1,"From a heritage site planted originally in 1859, this wine was made by Nils Venge and contains mostly Cabernet, with a small handful of Merlot and an even smaller pinch of Petit Verdot. Soft yet structured, it's layered in leathery dark-chocolate and black-fig tones, with juicy components of blackberry and cassis. It should age through 2022."
Dominio IV,Grenache-Syrah,93.0,42.0,1,"Estate grown from an historic vineyard planted by the producer's father, this wine is velvety smooth and decked in chocolate, densely rich and delicious in caramel and blackberry pie. Enjoyable now, it has the legs and structure to age through 2025–2030."
Dominio IV,Pinot Noir,90.0,51.5,2,"Ryan Cochrane left his San Francisco advertising gig in 2009 to make wine, and this bottling is evidence he made the right move. Wild mint shrubs, dried purple violets, elderflowers and pencil shavings show on the nose. The palate is heavily spiced with sagebrush, eucalyptus and other chaparral elements found near this increasingly amazing vineyard adjacent to Highway 101."
Dominio IV,Red Blend,88.0,23.0,1,"Matthias Pippig delivers a brilliant bottling on this smoky and ripe expression, with aromas of bacon grease, black pepper, violet and plump mulberries. The palate is thick and juicy, with lots of pork fat and dark fruit, though with the acidity and tannins required to provide balance."
Dominio IV,Syrah,88.0,36.0,2,"A good show of restraint with ripeness, this wine by Mike Sinor conveys green olive, dark herbs, clove sticks, pencil lead, Kalamata olives and peppery raspberry on the nose. It's lithe and savory once sipped, with more black and purple olives, Bing cherry fruit at the core and a distinctive pencil-shaving minerality toward the finish."
Dominio IV,Tempranillo,91.0,31.67,3,"This is a slightly riper approach from the longtime producer, with browned butter, vanilla, honeyed pineapple and a hint of seared marshmallow on the nose. The palate shows ripe brown pears and caramelized apples that carry deep into the finish. It's a balanced take on this style, never over the top."
Dominio IV,Tempranillo-Syrah,91.0,23.0,1,"Jammy, rich and leathery, this full-bodied, robust wine has a touch of smoke lingering in the back, beneath soft, well-integrated oak. Juicy, it's enjoyable now, while being structured enough to go another decade or so. Cellar through 2021."
Dominus,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.8,123.2,5,"From a 2,400-foot elevation vineyard, this wine is unexpectedly elegant and definitively age-worthy. Floral and unusual, the palate brings integrated tannins wrapped around a core of ripe blackberry and cassis. Structured, it has plenty of body and length, bringing an old world sensibility to new world fruit. Drink now through 2022."
Don & Sons,Pinot Noir,87.0,23.0,1,"Delicious aromas of black raspberries, frozen strawberries and cola season a slight bit of gamy character on this wine that master sommelier Paolo Barbieri makes in Los Olivos with Syrah star Joey Tensley. Gravel and tar show on the palate, which is boosted by 5% Viognier, as does lots of lavender and violet."
Donati,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,26.5,2,"Concentrate rose petals, crisp raspberries, and a rocky, black gravel—not quite as pungent as asphalt—pervades the nose on this wine from an extremely coastal, 13-acre vineyard planted in 1988. Flavors of freshly picked blackberry mesh with lots of fennel, licorice and anise-seed spice."
Donati,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,35.0,1,"This bodacious but balanced wine from a wild corner of Sonoma County has smoke and black pepper aromas, rich grape, boysenberry and roast beef flavors, very bracing tannins and full body. It's big, yes, but it also gives up nuances that make it complex and compelling. Best to drink after 2018."
Donati,Chardonnay,85.0,16.0,1,"This opens with pretty cherry fruit flavors, underscored with a touch of mineral and mocha. But there it ends, feeling one dimensional and fading fast in the finish. Three bottles tasted with similar results."
Donelan,Pinot Noir,89.0,55.0,1,"Softly fruity, this brings a gentle wash of bananas and cream, with a touch of caramel. If that sounds appealing, it is indeed, as it glides along a seamless finish. Drink now through 2018."
Donelan,Rhône-style Red Blend,94.0,50.0,1,"This is a blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 42% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot, which come together to form a full-bodied package of earthy compost and generously ripe blue and black plum. Soft tannins make it easy to enjoy."
Donelan,Roussanne-Viognier,90.0,48.0,1,"From the Nunes Vineyard, this robust red is concentrated in black cherry, tar and cinnamon spice, full bodied from having been cradled in French oak, 20% of it new. The acidity and body are both medium level, while the ripeness is high."
Donelan,Syrah,94.0,48.0,2,"This Sonoma County wine made by Santa Barbara-based Winemaker Andrew Murray is explosively juicy in black currant and berry, while offering soft, lean aspects of herb and pepper."
Donkey & Goat,Chardonnay,93.25,32.0,4,"This bottling is leveled by 10% Roussanne, and shows ripe yellow peach, honeydew melon, honeyed toast, pear custard and a slight cashew-like marzipan on the fairly dense nose. Rounded flavors of pear, melon, mango and honey dust comprise the palate."
Donkey & Goat,Clairette,89.0,30.0,1,"This wine's aromas are muted at first but open delicately into strawberry and cherry most predominantly, representing the 55% Mourvèdre and 35% Grenache in the blend. On the finish, the 10% Petite Sirah speaks up in the form of chocolatey tannins."
Donkey & Goat,Grenache,93.0,27.5,2,"Equal parts malbec and merlot with the balance (8%) petit verdot, it smells quite fruity with notes of plum and berry along with peat and bubblegum. There's no noticeable oak influence (all two year old and neutral barrels) to distract from the smooth fruit flavors and bright acidity."
Donkey & Goat,Mourvèdre,89.6,28.4,5,"Blacker than night, this blend of 79% Petite Sirah and 21% Petit Verdot grown in the Clarksburg and Lodi appellations, is fragrant in blackberry and plum with just a hint of cassis. Juicy and measured in power, it's made to be enjoyed in its youth and will make a good companion to steak."
Donkey & Goat,Red Blend,87.67,27.0,3,"Though billed as a red blend, this is made from 98% Merlot and does justice to the variety. Complete on the entry in ripe fruit, it offers dusty cedar, graphite and oak elements within a cool-climate sensibility of savory grace and balance."
Donkey & Goat,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.5,35.0,2,"Blackberry ice cream, vanilla and licorice meet with fudge and espresso on the immensely rich nose of this blend of 55% Petite Sirah, 26% Zinfandel and 19% Syrah. Blueberry and cassis dominate the palate, which is soft in texture and full of chocolate, cherry cordial and fig flavors."
Donkey & Goat,Roussanne,88.0,32.0,3,"Earthy and brawny in pungent compost aromas, this wine has a citrus-laden edge of crisp mineral and bitterroot. Full-bodied and richly layered, its fruit components are dipped in baked rhubarb and black tea."
Donkey & Goat,Syrah,90.0,39.75,4,"This beloved annual bottling by Randall Grahm blends 39% Mourvèdre, 33% Grenache, 26% Syrah and 2% Cinsaut to create a very savory, Old World-style expression, with aromas of roasted game, pencil shavings, dried red fruits and blood. The palate is very iron-rich and rustic, with uncrushed black peppercorns and raw and dried meat flavors."
Donkey & Goat,White Blend,90.25,29.5,4,"Classic and compelling aromas of rose petal, candied boysenberry, hibiscus reduction and vanilla brioche show on the nose of this wine from a rugged appellation east of the Salinas Valley. The firmly structured palate shows rose petals and tart berries, dusted by fennel pollen, white pepper and chaparral spice."
Donum,Chardonnay,93.0,72.5,2,"This all-out Zin makes no bones about its sweetness, heavy oak spiciness and full body. Maple syrup, brown sugar and cherry jam are the dominant notes that crowd the aromas and flavors and linger on the finish. Very rich and full-bodied, it has prominent caramelized oak notes that keep the tannins from biting."
Donum,Pinot Noir,93.44,85.12,16,"Light in color and body and modest in alcohol at 12%, this is a curiously intriguing Grenache, tightly wound in freshly picked strawberries and an undeniable earthiness. Aromas lean toward roses with a heavy hint of menthol. A touch of pepperiness on the finish completes the wine."
Double Canyon,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,56.5,2,"Syrah comprises more than half of this spicy, Rhône-style blend, which also includes Grenache and Cinsault. A scent of wild berry introduces this wine, which feels sharp and carries a hint of pickle barrel, though no American oak is indicated. The palate broadens to display a flavor of strawberry compote and a whiff of chocolate."
Double Eagle,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,80.0,1,"Lighter in color than many 2012s from Santa Barbara County, this wine begins with an inviting nose that offers scents of strawberry-infused balsamic vinegar and sandalwood. Once sipped, it's light and crisp, but surprisingly powerful, with cranberry, pomegranate and a leather finish."
Douglas Green,Chardonnay,86.0,11.0,1,"The savory side of Pinot Noir shines in this bottling from a vineyard south of the Arroyo Seco appellation. Aromas include stewed tomato and green olives with pimento. Falling in line are the Middle Eastern spices and olive tapenade on the palate, with tight pomegranate fruit. Serve with lamb gyros."
Dowsett Family,Gewürztraminer,90.8,22.0,5,"Once known as Nugent Vineyard, Winside is a blend of Dijon and Pommard clones that's on the more robust side, especially in this climatically perfect vintage. Offering exuberant red cherry fruit and layers of cola and milk chocolate, it's ready to enjoy with pork tenderloin and similarly hearty fare."
Dowsett Family,Mourvèdre,88.0,45.0,1,"The personality of Pinot Noir comes through in this charming, medium-bodied, lighter-colored and aromatic offering. Nuances are reminiscent of cherry, herb and walking through a pine forest, along with a tangy texture and fresh finish that lingers."
Dowsett Family,Pinot Noir,92.0,37.0,1,"Earthy, spicy and big-boned in rich tones of ripe black cherry, licorice and mocha, the wine is fully developed in weight, well-integrated in tannins and hearty, with plenty of power and mouthfilling fruit."
Dowsett Family,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,30.0,1,"Green elements are often frowned upon in New World Bordeaux, but this wine shows why that's flawed thinking. Black pepper and sour cherry accompany vibrant jalapeño on the nose. That vivid herbaceous character extends to the palate, making for an intriguing, eye-opening drink. Why not pair with chile relleno?"
Dowsett Family,Riesling,88.0,16.0,1,"Winemaker Collin Cranor is superexcited about Casa De Vinas, a vineyard much talked about in the Livermore Valley. His Petite Sirah is clearly not petite, but everything PS lovers will love: oaky, dark and ripe, with smoke, chocolate and textured tannins."
Doyenne,Red Blend,90.17,36.67,12,"Roughly half Grenache, 38% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre, this shows intriguing aromas of black fruits, citrus, pine needle and loam. In the mouth there is a somewhat disjointed impression, with raspberry fruit and coffee grounds dominating."
Doyenne,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,43.0,5,"This aromatic rosé is a lovely shade of pale salmon, and has mashed apple and yeasty, almost hoppy notes. Flavors are bracing and lively, hinting at pretty cherry fruit."
Doyenne,Syrah,91.54,57.0,13,"This is pleasant and light, with a strawberry flavor that's lightly threaded with streaks of spice and sandalwood. It's a delicate and pretty wine, reflective of the cooler vintage."
Doyenne,White Blend,90.0,34.0,1,"Sporting a much-improved label design, the 2009 Natasha brings pungent, assertive scents of tomato leaf, pepper and moist earth. Sharp and focused, the fruit is there, though it's the leaf and earth components that stand out. For its earthy style, it's a well-made and complex offering."
Dr. Konstantin Frank,Chardonnay,88.0,15.0,1,"A toasty streak of espresso-flavored richness marks this single-vineyard offering. The fruit is ripe and clean, with a tart red-berry flavor at the core."
Dr. Konstantin Frank,Rosé,87.0,15.0,1,"Surprisingly soft, with an easy-drinking roundness to the midpalate, this is a bit of a butter cookie Chardonnay despite the INOX (stainless steel) moniker. The pretty fruit is the highlight."
Dr. Loosen & J. Christopher,Pinot Noir,94.0,75.0,1,"Clean and easy drinking, this is created using a fruit from all three estate vineyards. Lightly spicy apple, pear and peach flavors combine gracefully, giving the wine a solid and appealingly fruity core."
Dragonette,Chardonnay,93.0,60.0,1,"This rustic Barbera tastes of blackberry. It's medium bodied with just-right acidity and tannins that are well-integrated and smooth. The finish gets a little bit meaty, which will work fine alongside meaty, smoky foods."
Dragonette,Pinot Noir,91.8,58.8,5,"An herbal red blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Malbec, this is earthy, focused and straightforward."
Dragonette,Sauvignon Blanc,89.33,44.0,6,"Pencil shavings and leather aromas mark the entry of this robustly full-bodied wine. It has a pronounced forest floor character, while blackberry and black cherry flavors combine with licorice and dark chocolate, filling out the richer notes that interweave throughout the palate, leading into a long finish."
Dragonette,Syrah,93.75,53.75,4,"From a south-facing hillside site on the edge of the Petaluma Gap at Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard, this fruity and complex wine shows white pepper and earthy notes, taking time to open in the glass. Varietal in its pepper, leather and violet aromas, it's sleek and tart—a cool-climate rendition of the grape."
Dragonfly Creek,Pinot Noir,83.0,15.0,1,"From a vineyard owned by Talley but shared in equal parts with two other wineries, this bottling is snappy on the nose with black raspberry, graphite, sweet juniper and rose hip aromas. On the palate, it's light in body and lively with acidic energy, offering raspberry, tart plum skin and sour cherry, inflected with anise spice. There is significant length to the mouthwatering finish."
Draxton,Rosé,90.0,18.0,1,"This reserve begins as a vineyard-block selection, and spends nine months in 100% French oak. It's bright and brambly, melding citrus skins and oils, fresh raspberries and cherries, and a touch of chocolate. There's a hint of dustiness as well, and it's drinking quite well already: no need to wait."
Draxton,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,18.5,2,"This is one of the producer's more full-bodied wines, a blend from several sites along Eastside Road, including Calegari, Foss and a new source—Lewis MacGregor Estate. Rich, round and plush, it's as strong as black coffee in its marriage of earthy allspice, baked cherry, blueberry and smoke. Moderate acidity allows for an underlying minerality."
Dreaming Tree,Red Blend,86.0,15.0,2,"Norm Yost is considered the sparkling pioneer of Santa Barbara County, and his bubblies continue to excel. This exhibits fresh lemon and lime zest notes, with wet cement, peach blossom and sourdough yeast on the nose. There is a grippy tension to the palate, where lemon, green apple and biscuity flavors intermingle."
Drew,Pinot Noir,89.5,46.0,2,"A beautifully rich and rewarding expression of tropical fruit and creamy texture, this estate white spends nine months in large French oak casks and is selected from the best lots. Supporting acidity keeps it refreshing in waves of lime and grapefruit."
Drink Washington State,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,26.0,2,"This is as well-balanced an interpretation of Roussanne as they come in California—proudly plump but not flabby. Light gold in color, it offers caramelized banana, custard, beeswax and apple blossom aromas. A backbone of lemony acidity runs through the palate, buttressed with ripe melon, mango and more tropical fruit flavors."
Drink Washington State,Carmenère,88.0,26.0,2,"Comprised of multiple clones from five different vineyards, this exceptional value includes a rich cohesive core of purple fruits, amplified with barrel flavors of toasted coconut and bright spice. Everything is beautifully focused across the full palate, and even after being open for a full 24 hours, the wine tastes fresh and delicious."
Drink Washington State,Chardonnay,88.0,19.0,2,"There is a lot to like in this blend of 80% Syrah, 18% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot, which offers deep blackberry, black cherry, star anise and pie crust on the ripe, exotically spicy nose. The palate is rich with black cherry and vanilla flavors, cut by dark spice, lingering acidity and tannic depth."
Drouhin Oregon Roserock,Pinot Noir,93.5,60.0,2,"Oxidized almost to the point of being tawny in the glass, this soft and buttery wine has virtually no fruit left, and finishes with a bitter edge."
Dry Creek Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,70.0,1,"This wine is an unusual blend of Barbera (40%), Malbec (25%), Sangiovese (21%) and Cabernet Franc. It works, with aromas of sweet baking spices, vanilla, cherry and herb that are followed by generous, velvety cherry flavors. The oak is very primary but it still brings appeal."
Dry Creek Vineyard,Chardonnay,89.67,28.67,6,"This variety is extremely rare in Washington, especially in single-vineyard wines that are dry farmed. Light aromas of white pepper, lime and herb are followed by a dry palate marked by a strong sense of acidity. It needs food to shine."
Dry Creek Vineyard,Chenin Blanc,88.75,13.0,4,"Extremely light and floral, this bottling offers apple blossom, tangerine, apple butter and cashew notes on the nose. It's a straightforward Chardonnay on the palate, with butter, citrus and marzipan touches backed by healthy acidity."
Dry Creek Vineyard,Meritage,90.0,45.0,3,"This wine from one of Amador County's legendary vineyards is structured, oaky and pleasantly dry. Toasty, peppery, grilled aromas and straightforward blackberry and raspberry fruit flavors are backed by firm tannins and acidity, lending the palate appetizing bite. While this vintage tastes tighter than the last two, expect it to mellow through 2020 at least."
Dry Creek Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,28.0,2,"Somewhat lighter in color, this wine offers subtle aromas of raspberries, flowers and herb. The flavors are lithe and delicate, with coffee accents that persist on the lingering finish. It's a very pretty expression of this variety."
Dry Creek Vineyard,Zinfandel,90.91,32.55,11,"This wine comes from 35-year-old vines at French Creek Vineyard. Light aromas of spice, herb and candlewax are followed by a medium-bodied palate brightened by lively, lemony acidity. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
Drytown,Malbec,88.0,19.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of sweet blue fruit, herb and spice are followed by plump, plush plum flavors that go down easy. It brings a sense of deliciousness."
Drytown,Pinot Noir,83.0,19.0,1,"Cabernet Franc (54%) takes the lead on this blend, with the balance Merlot (29%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. The aromas of flower, barrel spice and herb are light, with slightly dried-out raspberry and cherry notes lurking in the background. It also has a medicinal top note. Flavors are super-smooth and palate-coating, finishing sweet."
Drytown,Red Blend,87.0,10.0,2,"Mushroom, tobacco, dried spice….this is a wine with unique character. It's distinctive but mellow on the palate, with red berry, pepper, cigarbox and smoke flavors. Pair with grilled meats, duck."
Drytown,Riesling,84.0,17.0,1,"Grapefruit, citrus and flowers on the nose are followed by a lively, slightly sweet array of fun flavors in this “early” wine. Released young, it has an effervescent quality that makes it a nice choice for a warm weather sip or accompaniment to dessert. Not terribly complex, but appealing."
Drytown,Rosé,85.0,10.0,1,"A subtle, pretty nose of vanilla, cherry and strawberry is backed up by bigger flavors of sour cherry, spice and vanilla. Fun and exuberant but not terribly delicate. A good match with meats and poultry."
Duarte Georgetown,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,39.0,1,"All five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here, with 55% Cabernet Sauvignon leading the way. Red and black berries burst forth first, allowing for a juiciness on the palate, followed by tar, licorice and more blackberry. Balanced though full bodied, it finishes simply."
Duarte Georgetown,Petit Verdot,86.0,25.0,1,"This blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Marsanne from Rhône grape pioneer Bob Lindquist and partner Charles Banks is a new project focused on entry-level offerings. Steely aromas of lemon oil and pear give way to a plate of buttered apple slices and tart yellow-grapefruit peel, mixing warmth with tang."
Duarte Georgetown,Rosé,83.0,10.0,1,"This wine hails from the Sonoma Coast sections of the Russian River Valley and Petaluma Gap. It delivers in terms of price-versus-quality by opening with strong scents of earth and black plum baked in cinnamon and clove. Light, it's soft on the palate and finishes lean."
Duarte Georgetown,Tempranillo,89.0,25.0,1,"One of a series of single-clone offerings from Kason, this suffers from a sameness of flavors. Black fruits are soaked in aggressive and bitter oak flavors that push the smoke and char to the forefront, leaving bitter tannins as a result."
Dubindil,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,34.0,1,"Asphalt, sour berries and purple flowers show on the nose of this brawny wine by winery owner, Tara Gomez, a descendent of the Chumash tribe. The rigid tannic structure on the palate allows only thicker espresso bean and more tar flavors to emerge."
Dubindil,Merlot,87.0,34.0,1,"Fresh-squeezed yellow grapefruit and pear juice trend toward white flowers and a tropical style in this widely available, stylishly labeled and crowd-pleasing bottling from the pioneering Niven family. Apple juice and apple blossoms combine on the palate, where flavors lean slowly into banana and ripe pears."
Dubost,Grenache Noir,90.0,40.0,1,"Elusive aromatically, this wine begins to show hints of violet and rose as it opens, comforting whiffs that ride over powerfully, pillowy tannins. Savory in style, and fairly light bodied, it's a round, soft wine with a lot of juicy red cherry."
Dubost,Negrette,88.0,45.0,1,"Strong iron, rosebuds, wet gravel and a touch of hibiscus show on the nose of this bottling, which seems ready to unfurl but remains quite reserved right now. The palate starts rather tarry, with more iron and some graphite as well as pine needle and touch of cranberry fruit."
Dubost,Red Blend,90.33,66.67,6,"Soft layers of well-managed tannin and rocky minerality stand out in this older vintage, which has taken on secondary characteristics that suggest it may be nearly past its prime. Baked raisin bread comes into play the longer the wine is in the glass."
Dubost,Rhône-style White Blend,91.0,33.33,3,"A plethora of smoke and dried tobacco unveils a rustic quality to this estate-grown wine, big in tannin and somewhat diluted in fruit."
Dubost,Sangiovese,84.0,40.0,1,"Pungent earth and forest floor surround big oak, full-figured body and a yeasty baked-bread quality. These are layered against soft tannins that pop big and hard on the finish."
Duck Pond,Chardonnay,87.0,15.0,1,"Market Vineyards wines take their names from the financial world, which leads to the question... Merval? Turns out it's the common name for the Argentine stock exchange (not a blend of Merlot and Valium). This is a fine, Washington-style Malbec, the tannins ripe and slightly grainy, with fruit flavors of strawberry compote, cassis and blueberry. Ground coffee permeates the finish."
Duck Pond,Pinot Gris,89.33,24.33,3,"This needs more time in the bottle to unfold, but right away you can see there is substantial fruit and plenty of barrel flavors to go with it. Cassis, smoke, toffee and tobacco are all in play, and as the wine breathes it begins slowly unwrapping more and more detail."
Duck Pond,Pinot Noir,88.25,32.0,4,"Aged for 22 months in 20% new French oak, this blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot completes a trio of excellent Conner Lee-designates from :Nota Bene in 2009. It's full bodied and streaked with herb, thistle, fresh greens, tart berries, and cocoa nibs. Pair it with a nice, juicy steak!"
Duckhorn,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.33,135.0,3,"High Slopes begins tannic and tight but settles down into a finely honed Syrah of notable structure, layered in pepper, smoke and tart blackberry flavor. It will pair deliciously with savory dishes along the lines of cassoulet or roast game and cellar another 5–10 years."
Duckhorn,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,95.0,6,"Cedarville remains an estate producer to follow in the Foothills, melding a well-farmed site with clean, clear winemaking in the cellar. Grown on decomposed granite hillsides, this Syrah has 4% Viognier, just the right touch to bring out the best aromatics, highlighted by sage. Dark, earthy and leathery, this wine is holding onto its tannin and oak, but given time to rest in the cellar 5–7 years, it'll scream to be served with cassoulet."
Duckhorn,Chardonnay,91.0,55.0,2,"A generic expression of the variety with some notions of ripe plum, dark cherry and black pepper, this straightforward wine is ready to drink now. It takes on full tannic strength on the finish."
Duckhorn,Merlot,90.71,95.86,7,"There's a bitterness within this wine, a taste of tobacco and tomato leaf that lords over subtle blackberry, black cherry, plum and a healthy dose of cinnamon and pepper. Medium bodied, it finishes flat."
Duckhorn,Red Blend,94.0,135.0,1,"A sweet version of Riesling, this offers fresh apple and strawberry aromas, sweet melon and cucumber flavors, a soft texture and light body."
Due Vigne,Dolcetto,86.0,19.0,1,"Not too heavy or too rich, this medium-bodied wine has mellow spice and fruit flavors, good balance and a gentle texture. It will be perfect when you don't want to drink a blockbuster."
Due Vigne,Nebbiolo,87.0,26.0,1,"Aromas of apple and pear are followed by dry, medium-bodied fruit flavors, dipping a bit in the middle before coming back together."
Dumas Station,Cabernet Franc,90.0,30.0,1,"This lightly spritzy, sweet wine has the sort of orange flavor that recalls baby aspirin. There's an impression of artificality; the fruit does not come through with much freshness."
Dumas Station,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,51.67,6,"The grapes for this old-vine wine come from various appellations within Sonoma, including Dry Creek and Sonoma Valley. The Zin is blended with mixed blacks and Mourvèdre, which combine for a sweet, thick and jammy experience of cherry-raspberry molasses. A spicy hit of pepper peaks on the finish."
Dumas Station,Merlot,90.5,28.5,4,"On the thin side of light-bodied, this has an abundance of oak that overpowers the subtle fruit in this wine from an estate property in a relatively warm appellation. Ripe dark cherry takes on a baked quality here."
Dumas Station,Red Blend,88.0,25.6,5,"A well-balanced and focused wine, this is not big in structure but has tasty fruit flavors, a good crisp mouthfeel and moderate tannins for grip. The wine won't soon get tiring, and will make a good, versatile pairing with food."
Dumas Station,Syrah,91.5,40.0,2,"Straw yellow in color, this widely available wine offers vanilla, lemon curd, honeysuckle and a touch of browned butter on the nose. Once sipped, seared lemon and yellow apple show first, settling into a vanilla cream groove and finishing on a touch of marshmallow."
Dunbar,Zinfandel,89.33,32.0,3,"Napoleon's secret was that he liked Syrah in his Bordeaux blends, so this mix of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Syrah, 13% Cabernet Franc, 12% Merlot, 4% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot shows why, offering fresh and vibrant aromas of blueberry and licorice candy. Bright blackberry preserves pop on the palate as does fudge in this easy-drinking wine."
Dunham,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,29.0,1,"Bracing and tangy, this light-bodied wine has distinct melon aromas, similar flavors and tasty accents of white pepper and fresh fennel. While nicely reserved it also has complexity and great balance."
Dunham,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.73,53.18,11,"Tart and tightly wound fruit flavors range from watermelon to strawberry, with a heavy infusion of citrus. It's sharply acidic, with some suggestions of toast from light barrel aging. A streak of cola runs through the finish."
Dunham,Chardonnay,88.83,24.67,6,"Fruit is sourced from multiple sites, including Sangiacomo and Rancho Salina for this elegant wine which is slight in black and blue fruit with a subtle notion of leather. Structurally, it has a deep complexity of tannins that remains integrated on the back of the palate. It's ready for the table."
Dunham,Merlot,90.86,75.0,7,"This tempting wine from one of Amador's biggest and oldest wineries has a great price and lots of big flavors. It smells like wild berries and light baking spices, tastes almost jammy, and has a classy dry balance. A very smooth texture wraps up all that goodness and makes it easy to enjoy."
Dunham,Red Blend,89.54,23.69,13,"This is 100% Syrah from the Boushey vineyard. It's so compact that it's almost impenetrable, but the gorgeous aromas portend a glorious wine given appropriate bottle age and/or breathing time. A dark, dusty mix of black fruits, black olives, black coffee and licorice, this has such density that it's almost impossible to separate out all the fruit layers, let alone the earthier components that make it so distinctive. At 14.8% alcohol, this may be the biggest Betz Boushey Syrah ever."
Dunham,Riesling,90.8,24.2,10,"This outright delicious wine brings aromas of herbs, coffee and pencil lead along with a mixture of red and blue fruit. The flavors are sweet, luscious and concentrated, bringing a very high yum factor. Give it plenty of time to open up."
Dunham,Syrah,91.5,63.67,6,"Lemon and grapefruit rind provide a brightness to the nose and palate here, along a creamier outpouring of butterscotch and savory dried stone fruit. A lacing of minerality is pronounced throughout, with the finish complete in sharp edges complemented by a sense of soft brioche."
Dunham,White Blend,86.0,15.0,1,"This producer owns the coveted vineyard designation, selecting some fantastic fruit that yields a wine that is intense in black cherry and forest floor, accented by wild mushroom. The style is substantial and generous in ripeness and oak, mouthfillingly rich and lushly layered, yet elegant on the finish. Cellaring, through 2020, should soften its edges."
Dunites,Syrah,90.0,32.0,1,"From the cooler reaches of the Petaluma Gap, a sub-area of the larger Sonoma Coast that is awaiting its own appellation status, this Pinot was made with 25% whole-cluster berries, giving it a rough-hewn, earthy edginess that's appealing in the glass. Tightly wound cherry and cranberry complete the picture, with a taste of dried herb and black tea on the lengthy finish."
Dunning Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,32.0,2,"This aromatically brooding wine offers aromas of black tea, cinnamon, herbs, licorice and dried cherry. It's full in feel, layered and rich with a lingering fruit- and herb-filled finish, and a good sense of tannic structure holding it all together."
Dunning Vineyards,Chardonnay,92.0,26.0,1,"Crisp, dry and searing in acidity, this 100% varietal wine is complex, showing sour lemon and brine notes, with orange blossom tones weaving their way throughout. A delight on the palate, the wine takes on structured weight toward the finish, making sure to leave an impression."
Dunning Vineyards,Petite Sirah,90.0,45.0,1,"Initial wafts of cannabis-like herbs quickly emerge into lime pith, limestone, struck match and oyster shells, with white flowers and yeastiness showing as well. There's a vivid tension between tart apple flesh and citrus pith on the palate, with lemon curd and pineapple elements arriving over time. Sit on this until 2017 so the acid can mellow, then drink through 2027."
Dunstan,Chardonnay,93.0,45.0,1,"There's a strong nose on this single-vineyard from a reliable appellation in the middle of Monterey County, with white floral, crispy apple and light honey aromas. It's zesty with tongue-singeing acidity, showing flavors of dried apples, lime juice and honeydew melon."
Dunstan,Pinot Noir,92.0,55.0,2,"Made in a full-bodied style, this estate wine is generous in blackberry, black licorice and dark cherry, with classic cola spice dancing around its edges. Smooth and memorable, it is made from a handful of vineyards, including Nicole's, Bow Tie and Robert Thomas, all vineyard-designates of their own for the producer."
Dunstan,Rosé,88.0,25.0,1,"Aromas of golden honey and concentrated white flowers entertain the nose on this dessert offering from the urban winery on Santa Barbara's Eastside. Quite delicious and balanced once sipped, the viscous flavors blend honey, lemonade reduction and guava, with bright acidity keeping it nicely alive on the palate."
Durant,Chardonnay,91.83,28.17,6,"Punchy, sizable tannins make this wine a beast at first. It's dry on the palate, yet sultry, well-defined layers of dark cherry and toasty vanilla-oak manage to persist around seasonings of minty dried herb and cinnamon. From a well-known vineyard high atop what is called the Petaluma Gap, it's characteristically robust and age-worthy, able to cellar through 2022."
Durant,Pinot Gris,90.0,18.0,1,"Coming from 11 different vineyards, Doug Margerum's blend of 43% Grenache, 41% Syrah, 9% Mourvèdre, 4% Counoise and 3% Cinsault offers squeezed olallieberries and dried oregano on the nose. The palate shows lots of boysenberry jam, leveled by pine-sap and herbal elements as well."
Durant,Pinot Noir,90.0,54.0,5,"Dry and delicious, this lightly colored rosé opens with a compelling waft of rose water and exudes copper-pink color. A refreshingly searing acidity maintains vibrancy from start to finish, accented in grapefruit. This quaff is great on its own or throughout a meal."
Dusted Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.2,51.4,5,"About half Cabernet, the rest a Bordeaux mix, this opens nicely with forward plum and cherry fruit. There are notes of savory herbs in the nose, but the wine turns astringent and the finish a little chalky and stemmy."
Dusted Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.6,55.8,5,"Front-loaded fruit has a strawberry soda pop flavor, but the wine gains a little extra depth from the tannins and barrels, which add texture, spice and a bit of salty chocolate."
Dusted Valley,Chardonnay,89.0,32.0,2,"The best wine to date from Ashley Trout, this single-vineyard Malbec seduces with its thick, dense, decadently lush flavors of black cherry and cassis. Licorice, tar, coffee and cacao notes come into play on the deep and lingering finish. If anything, the wine is even better on the second day, as the fruit flavors mature into a plummy Christmas-cake delight."
Dusted Valley,Cinsault,92.0,32.0,1,"It's a shame that just 100 cases of this wine were made, as this bright, fresh, exciting Zinfandel belongs with the best of California, not just Washington. The fresh-picked strawberry and raspberry flavors are concentrated and vibrating with juicy acidity. They lead into a sappy, lengthy midpalate, with an underpinning of rock."
Dusted Valley,G-S-M,91.0,42.0,1,"Deep and delicious with inviting layers of raspberry and berry cobbler, Big John is a brambly, structured Zin, with bright zaps of black pepper and clove, plus a long, satisfying finish. This is perhaps the best Zin in all of Calaveras County right now."
Dusted Valley,Mourvèdre,88.0,39.0,3,"This is a very mineral-driven pink wine, with aromas of wet rocks, chalk and even steel giving way to the slightest hints of orange and strawberry. The flavors are very delicate and refreshing on the palate, with melon and red pear, rounded out by a key lime acidity."
Dusted Valley,Petite Sirah,91.0,42.0,1,"This distinctive wine is spicy and meaty in flavor and very firm in texture as lots of fine-grained tannins give it grip, and full body helps it flood the tongue and coat the sides of the mouth. Best after 2019."
Dusted Valley,Red Blend,90.33,41.0,3,"Dried apple and salted almond aromas show on the nose of this bottling from a winery started in 1987. There is a flinty character to the sip, alongside squeezed lime and baked apple, with a light smokiness noticeable throughout."
Dusted Valley,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.5,40.5,4,"Earthy black tea and clove are the highlights in this medium-bodied, moderately oaked wine, a fruity undercurrent of black cherry and strawberry lifting the savory, sassy elements to a bright core."
Dusted Valley,Rosé,87.0,19.0,2,"Strong aromas of blueberries and blue flowers show on this rich and penetrating wine from the eastside of Paso Robles. Thick and chalky tannins coat the palate, delivering more blueberry and ripe grape flavors, cut by a strong acidity."
Dusted Valley,Syrah,90.78,47.28,18,"This 100% varietal wine brings aromas of black tea, cocoa, herb, coffee, spice and black cherry. The palate is elegantly styled, with abundant vanilla accents and lightly gritty tannins. It needs time to stretch its legs."
Dusty Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,15.0,1,"Ripe red fruits mingle gracefully, along with suggestions of toasted coconut, from aging in one-quarter new barrels. There is a metallic streak running through the finish as well, which might suggest that you give it some extra aeration before drinking."
Dusty Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,25.0,1,"Big and robust in ripe black cherry and a richness of vanilla, this wine is full-bodied and then some, imparting plenty of tannin and structure. Forest floor, spicy cardamom and smoky cola give definition to the weight."
Dusty Cellars,Red Blend,87.0,15.0,2,"Good idea, but the execution isn't there. Watery, thin and charmless; like orange candy diluted with lemon juice."
Dusty Cellars,White Blend,87.0,13.0,1,"Back in fine form, this shows crisp and fresh apple, white peach and green melon fruit. Aged in 41% new and 25% one-year-old oak, it's not especially toasty, but has the concentration and balance to develop well over the next six to eight years."
Dutton Estate,Chardonnay,87.5,40.5,4,"This Reserve Series bubbly accents its crisp green apple fruit with toasty aromas. Done via Méthode Champenoise, it spent five years en tirage. There's a fine bead and lingering persistent flavors with hints of nutmeg and lemon curd. All in all, this is a very fine effort."
Dutton Estate,Pinot Noir,90.0,52.12,8,"A blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon and 32% Merlot, this offers aromas of high-toned red fruit, French-oak spice and herbs that lead to luxurious but still in-check dark-fruit flavors. Tart black-tea accents persist on the finish."
Dutton Estate,Sauvignon Blanc,88.4,23.0,5,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. There's freshness to the fruit, with aromas of cherry and raspberry kissed by herb, clove and spice. The flavors are lush and palate-coating, with the tannins bringing a touch of astringency that hopefully will settle out with additional time in the bottle."
Dutton-Goldfield,Chardonnay,92.6,46.9,10,"This broad-textured, complex and indulgent Rhône-style blend has cedar, cola and blackberry aromas and concentrated fruit, earth and spice flavors. Milk chocolate richness emerges on the midpalate and plays through the finish."
Dutton-Goldfield,Gewürztraminer,92.5,28.75,4,"This lovely, full-bodied white offers generous caramel apple and baked pear flavors cradled in toasted oak that brings nutmeg and vanilla aspects. The rich roundness finds refreshment on the finish in stony acidity."
Dutton-Goldfield,Pinot Blanc,92.5,30.0,2,"One of Elliott Dolin's first attempts at a red blend from this coastal appellation, this blend of 42% Cabernet Franc, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Syrah and 9% Petit Verdot offers an elegant nose of elderflower, dried blueberry, black pepper, oregano and crushed gravel minerality. It's dense and bone-dry on the palate, its concentrated lilac, violet and blueberry syrup flavors framed by chalky tannins."
Dutton-Goldfield,Pinot Noir,92.26,58.35,23,"This is a creamy, compelling Bordelais style of Sauvignon Blanc. Candied lemon peel, dried apple, light honey and and petrol aromas show on the nose. The rich palate offers poached pear, sea salt and preserved lemon flavors, presented on waves of soft, plush texture."
Dutton-Goldfield,Riesling,88.5,30.0,4,"Velvety and thick, this wine is tannic, oaky and still tenacious about its youth. Spicy cardamom, violet and dried herb notes make it more earthy than fruit-driven, begging for complementary fare at the table. Raspberry, black cherry and blackberry flavors vie for attention."
Dutton-Goldfield,Syrah,94.5,50.0,4,"There are two levels of aroma to this blend of 49% Grenache, 34% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah: a bright floral touch and gravel-like minerality surround a deeper core of black currant and blueberry fruit. The palate is still quite tight, with elderberry, olallieberry and violet flavors, presented with a leathery texture. It shows lots of potential but still needs time. Drink 2018–2023."
Dutton-Goldfield,Zinfandel,92.5,47.5,2,"Velvety, rich and intense upon first sip, this is a lively, well-built wine, held back in bottle and offering layers of blackberry, black cherry, anise and sage flavor. Fruity and feral, it delivers a lot of nuance within its powerful presentation."
Dynasty Cellars,Meritage,88.0,24.0,1,"Vibrant aromas of white flowers, ripe peach, fresh herb, cocoa butter and hard candy lead to nuanced, well-balanced fruit flavors that show just a touch of lees influence. It offers an exquisite sense of balance and depth along with an extended finish."
E16,Chardonnay,90.0,44.0,2,"Solidly built and fruity without seeming sweet, this full-bodied wine combines concentrated flavors with a firm structure of fine-grained tannins and supportive acidity. Light oak touches add interest, but the wine's power and appeal come from bold varietal-fruit flavors."
E16,Pinot Noir,90.5,43.5,4,"Baked blackberry and licorice show on the nose of this Super Tuscan-style blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. It combines Old World and New World elements well, its rocky minerality framing baked blackberry fruit, underpinned by chalky tannins and steady acidity."
ENSO,Pinot-Chardonnay,89.0,40.0,1,"From the high-elevation site long prized by this producer, this wine opens with a sturdy tannic grip that takes time to resolve in the glass. As it does, ripe and robust layers of blackberry, currant and wild sage flavors emerge, bolstered by leather and bittersweet chocolate notes."
ENSO,Red Blend,88.0,40.0,1,"This rich, juicy yet elegant bottling from an old vineyard in west Paso Robles boasts black currant and rosebud aromas. The palate is textural and lithe, with tangy black plum and blackberry flavors. This has the bones to grow into an impressive wine in the years to come."
EOS,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.33,40.0,3,"Assorted aromas of blue, red and black fruit and dried herbs lead to ripe, full-bodied fruit flavors with a lingering finish. Chewy tannins back it, with the volatiles amped up."
EOS,Chardonnay,86.5,24.5,2,"This pale peach, lightly bricked wine brings aromas of strawberry and melon rind. It drinks dry with a broad feel and fruit flavors that linger."
EOS,Moscato,85.5,21.0,2,"Quite light in the glass, this wine leans a tad sweet on the nose, with exuberant apple blossoms, jasmine and banana-chip aromas. There is a chalky tension and pithy grip to the palate, where apple, pear and white-peach flavors trend toward ripe guava."
EOS,Petite Sirah,87.75,27.75,4,"A virtual fruit salad with bubbles, this wine gushes cherry, apple and banana aromas. It has equally ripe flavors and a broad, almost soft texture punctuated by lively effervescence."
EOS,Rhône-style White Blend,87.0,22.0,1,"Blended from 70% Syrah, 18% Mourvèdre and 12% Grenache, this concentrated refresher offers light, crisp waves of vanilla-cherry, grapefruit and orange. It will remain restrained in the glass if not revelatory in ripe fruit."
EOS,White Blend,85.0,22.0,1,"A pretty pale peach color, this wine has aromas of cherry, herbs and mineral. It drinks dry with generous, mouthwateringly tart cherry and watermelon flavors."
EOS,Zinfandel,88.6,28.6,5,"Can Paso Robles grow Pinot Noir? This wine suggests yes, at least in the cooler Willow Creek and Templeton Gap zones. This offers aromas of graphite, pomegranate and plums, followed by a palate that blends dark purple fruits with eucalyptus-like herbals. This will be even better with some time in bottle."
Eagle Eye,Cabernet Franc,85.0,55.0,1,"A powerful mix of Cabernet with 10% Petit Verdot, this soft, approachable wine reveals tightly wound layers of cassis, herb and sour cranberry. Dry tannins dominate on the palate and finish, suggesting a decant or airing beforehand."
Eagle Eye,Petit Verdot,86.0,60.0,2,"This homage to Chablis blends fruit from Bentrock (49%), Rita's Crown (22%), Zotovich (14%), Kessler-Haak (8%), Clos Pepe (3%), Esperanza (3%) and Radian (1%) vineyards, delivering tight aromas of yellow flowers and grilled peach. It dances across the tongue with playful, squeezed lemon acidity, showing crushed white rocks and baking soda minerality, and finishing its high tones on a grapefruit pith bitterness."
Eagle Eye,Red Blend,87.0,30.0,1,"This wine comes from the fourth-generation winemaking family behind Los Angeles' San Antonio Winery, which owns vineyards in Santa Lucia Highlands and Arroyo Seco. It offers aromas of smoked pork loin and wild berries and is peppery on the palate, with tart raspberry fruit and the driving sense of smoke throughout. The tannins are a bit firm right now, so wait until 2016 or so."
Eagle Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,31.0,1,"Dull and reduced on the nose, this wine grows earthy and hearty in the glass as it opens, offering a mix of leather, black pepper, coffee and baked plum flavors."
Eagle Ridge,Petite Sirah,90.0,31.0,1,"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah and smaller amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot shows prominent black cherry, cedar and licorice flavors, along with a streak of tobacco. Full bodied and moderate in acidity, it finishes simply."
Eagle Ridge,Red Blend,84.0,29.0,1,"Barrel notes of vanilla, baking spice and dill are at the fore, with dark fruit lurking in the background. The palate brings lingering creamy-feeling fruit and barrel flavors. It provides appeal but the oak seems too forward."
Eagle Ridge,Zinfandel,85.0,29.0,1,"Juicy cranberry and pie cherry fruit brings this wine into clear focus. There is an underpinning of wet cement that comes across in the mid-palate, a sort of a stone wall that the fruit can't quite overcome. It fades into an astringent, tannic finish, still buoyed by those juicy acids."
Earth's Harvest,Chardonnay,85.0,5.0,2,"A mongrel blend of Syrah, Sangiovese, Grenache and Cabernet Franc, this fruity red has a sweet core of blueberry jam, round and forward and quite appealing. It's dusted with baking spices and fades gently into a soft finish. Hard to imagine a more agreeable bottle of Washington red at this price."
Earthshaker,Syrah,84.0,16.0,1,"Confusingly, a sparkler labeled extra dry is actually extra sweet. It's a French convention that probably should not have been carried over into American labeling, for it simply muddies the water. This is not terribly sweet or sugary, and has a distinctive, lime-flavored citrus streak."
Easton,Barbera,87.91,25.0,11,A perfect balance of watermelon and strawberry fruit flavors introduce this lovely rosé. It's bone dry and as perfect a companion to your holiday turkey as your mid-summer picnic.
Easton,Cabernet Franc,91.5,22.0,2,"Mostly Merlot, with Syrah and Cab Franc filling in the rest, this pleasant, everyday red has forward, clean, but simple fruit flavors. It adds light streaks of vanilla, cut leaf, and a suggestion of moist earth. A good companion for a simple burger."
Easton,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.67,43.33,6,"A chocolaty frame wraps around the tightly wound cherry-fruit core. There are delicious seams of coffee, vanilla and caramel, along with notes of tea and tobacco. It's fully accessible and intriguingly complex."
Easton,Pinot Noir,88.5,30.0,2,"Dusty mocha scents meet cedar and herb in this dense, full-bodied wine. Spicy acidity keeps it fresh on the palate, with a zing of clove, cinnamon and black pepper."
Easton,Sauvignon Blanc,91.8,18.0,5,"From a high-elevation, steeply sloped site, this lovely, balanced wine offers a wealth of white pepper, garrigue and blueberry aromas, hitting all the marks of cool-climate character. Dense and smooth, it reveals smoke and game elements as it unwinds toward the spicy finish."
Easton,Zinfandel,90.69,29.46,13,"This is sourced from a longstanding, well-respected vineyard, and it does the windswept, foggy site justice. Tightly woven and youthful, it shows broad, juicy black cherry, wild strawberry, baking spice, compost and brawny oak flavors."
Eberle,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,27.0,4,"Like so many wines from this site, this is explosive and powerfully rich, yet a lurking acidity keeps it fresh and in check. Notes of cedar, dried herb and pencil shavings meet integrated oak and firm tannin, as brambly blackberry and blueberry flavors linger with clove-tinged spice on the finish."
Eberle,Chardonnay,86.5,22.5,4,"This limited cuvée is made from the smallest block at the estate vineyard. It's entirely hand-farmed, with stem-driven savory notes around strawberry fruit. There's a sense of a slightly metallic minerality threading through, with drying tannins."
Eberle,Red Blend,91.0,28.0,1,"Rich and creamy poached pear, banana and coconut aromas show in a ripe but not overdone way in this blend of 46% Roussanne, 37% Marsanne and 17% Viognier. There is a strong textural grip to the palate, focusing its apple, cherimoya and lemon peel flavors."
Eberle,Rhône-style Red Blend,86.0,23.0,2,"The aromas are locked up at present, with notes of barrel spice, clove, herb and brooding dark fruit. The fruit and barrel flavors are concentrated and tightly wound. The oak is predominant at present. Give it some time in the cellar to strut its stuff. Best after 2022."
Eberle,Rhône-style White Blend,87.75,24.0,4,"Two-thirds of this wine is Malbec and one-third is Merlot. Aromas of asphalt, plum and orange rind lead to a palate that possesses a lovely sense of balance and length."
Eberle,Syrah,88.75,25.5,4,"Bright sparks of red currant, black cherry and cassis provide this full-bodied wine with a juicy, rounded personality. Bold tannins frame its dense layers of fruit, complemented by sultry, gamy meat and smoke accents."
Eberle,Viognier,87.67,24.33,3,"Made from estate-grown fruit sourced high in the Sierra Foothills, this is a black, true-to-type Petite Sirah. It's packed with dusty coffee, chocolate and tobacco."
Eberle,Zinfandel,91.0,28.0,1,"A five-grape Bordeaux-style blend, this has a scent of rose water that drifts above earthier notes and tart berry flavors. Tight and focused, it finishes with a lick of cola and espresso."
Ebony,Chardonnay,92.0,30.0,2,"This is very spicy and smooth, with floral accents and a plummy core. It drinks well, although the finish fades rather quickly. A blend of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Syrah and Cabernet Franc filling in the rest."
Echo Ridge,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,60.0,1,"This is a complex, muscular wine, with good aging potential. The nose carries a whiff of animal (in a good way) and the black fruits are buoyed with generous acidity. Drink 2020–2028."
Eco Terreno,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,27.0,1,"A wonderful bouquet, like that of a well-aged wine, helps this spicy, fruity bottling stand out. It has gorgeous floral, tamarind and cola aromas, generous fruity flavors and a smooth, lightly tannic texture. An unusual and delicious twist on the variety."
Eco Terreno,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,40.0,1,"Cola, black cherry, nutmeg and spicy vanilla show on the nose of this blend of 50% Cabernet Franc, 25% Sangiovese and 25% Merlot, which winemaker Angela Soleno ages in bottle before releasing. The palate is framed by sticky tannins and offers dried black currant, black and green olive, clove and sarsaparilla flavors."
Eco Terreno,Chardonnay,86.0,29.0,1,"This especially ripe and deep style of Barbera grown at the Miraflores property looks quite dark, smells like dried fruit and tastes rich and full-bodied. It has admirable concentration, a smooth and layered texture and good length on the finish."
Eco Terreno,Sauvignon Blanc,84.5,22.0,2,"Bright and fruity, this blend of Grenache, Cinsault, Counoise and Syrah shows strawberry, pomegranate, hibiscus, rose, sumac and fennel scents on the nose. A fennel element plays on the palate as well, alongside cranberry, raspberry and turned earth flavors."
Edmonds Winery,Red Blend,85.33,30.67,3,"The vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA, and here it yields an aromatic wine, with inviting suggestions of buttery cherry pie. It also offers blueberries, a touch of light herb and a deliciously smooth mouthfeel."
Edna Valley Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,45.0,1,"Made entirely from Dijon clones to emphasize the fruit from this site, this wine is voluptuous in style, with a backbone of caramelized apple and pear flavor. Fig and quince contribute secondary characteristics of rounded richness, as a bite of salty lime marks the finish."
Edna Valley Vineyard,Chardonnay,87.0,24.33,6,"Black pepper scents meet very ripe berry and cherry aromas in this full-bodied, flavorful wine. It has broad texture, moderate tannins and acidity, and lots of concentration. Saturated with fruit, its ripness keeps unfolding on the finish."
Edna Valley Vineyard,Malbec,92.0,30.0,1,"On the light side for a reserve, this nicely balanced, elegant wine is from the southwest block of the estate vineyard. Red berries and pomegranate fruit, moderate acidity, smooth tannins and a full middle are the hallmarks. With a little decanting, it's ready to go."
Edna Valley Vineyard,Meritage,92.0,30.0,1,"The Clifton is holding back at the moment, its tannins feel a little scrapey and the fruit is showing a cool-climate aspect, although the Wahluke is generally one of Washington's hot spots. Gravelly and dry, with a long finish that somehow holds your interest long after the fruit has faded."
Edna Valley Vineyard,Pinot Noir,88.0,45.0,2,"This is an unusual mix of both Rhône and Bordeaux grapes—46% Mourvèdre, 19% Syrah, 13% Cabernet, 11% Grenache, 7% Merlot and 4% Malbec. It comes together in a somewhat diffuse red with good balance, good fruit and highlights of barrel and spice. Very tasty, just not particularly focused."
Edna Valley Vineyard,Syrah,86.0,40.0,2,"NH is making a heritage blend here from 50% Carignane, 30% Zinfandel from the Big John Vineyard and 20% Petite Sirah from Dalton Vineyard, all grown in Calaveras County. Superfull in body and texture, the blend is high in ripe raspberry and plum, Zin-spicy with savory cedar and smokiness too."
Educated Guess,Pinot Noir,87.0,15.0,1,"People will love this Cab Sauvignon-Merlot blend (60%-40%) that's got bright red fruit, mostly cherry and raspberry, finished with a tinge of cocoa."
Edwin Dyer,Pinot Noir,86.0,35.0,1,"Entirely varietal and estate-grown, this big-bottled wine offers a welcome taste of berry pie dusted in cinnamon and clove, the oak sturdy and sweet in vanilla. Luxuriously smooth, the texture is velvety and lush, like a river of dark chocolate. It ends in a flash of black pepper."
Edwin Dyer,Syrah,86.0,25.0,1,"This is a remarkable effort at the price, the wine sourced from Beckstoffer-owned sites in Carneros. Apple, peach and lemon highlight an integrated, vibrantly fresh experience on the palate, which lingers and impresses long after the finish."
Efeste,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.5,44.0,4,"Unctuous, with a profound sense of the salty sea, this wine is both rich and bright, balanced between crisp, defined acidity and complex depth of flavor. Lemon verbena and quince compete against a more nuanced, satisfying bite of caramelized pear as the finish refreshes."
Efeste,Bordeaux-style White Blend,89.0,25.0,1,"Brooding black currant, blackberry pie aromas meet with clove, sweet tobacco, black tea and hot cola on the nose of this blend of 49% Grenache, 27% Syrah and 24% Mourvèdre from the Coastview, Antle and Brosseau vineyards. There is candied Concord grape fruit to the energetic, light-on-its-feet sip, along with bay leaf, sage, marjoram and thyme."
Efeste,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.29,53.43,7,"This is a hugely structured and concentrated wine, the double plusses marked on barrel selections meant to call out the best of the best. Herbal, it offers complex characteristics of dried herb, cedar and leather, with a big grip of tannin tenacious on the palate and peppery finish."
Efeste,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,91.0,28.5,2,"This celebration of legendary Jerry Lohr's 80th birthday is a winner on all fronts. A zesty, uplifting nose of blackberry, cola, licorice, leather and clay leads into a cohesively woven palate of soy, shiitake dust, roast beef and dark chocolate. The acidity is well-measured, the tannins are chalky and grippy and it's powerful without being flashy."
Efeste,Cabernet-Syrah,90.5,27.5,2,"There's a feral quality to this bottling by the trio of Brandon Sparks-Gillis and John and Steve Dragonette that makes it fascinating. Aromas of dark cranberry and rose petal meet up with funkier game and composting flowers on the nose. There is strong ginger and mace spice on the sip, giving intrigue to the light strawberry, red plum and pomegranate fruits."
Efeste,Chardonnay,91.0,32.14,7,"This aromatic brooder shows notes of dark cherry, barrel spice, pencil lead, vanilla and herb, along with a light floral note. The palate has nuance and detail with balance that is impressive. Give it some time in the cellar to strut its stuff. Best after 2023."
Efeste,Merlot,90.0,39.0,3,"From a 16-year-old vineyard 2,200 feet up on the eastside of the Salinas Valley, this bottling offers fresh raspberry juice along with touches of bay leaf, pine and incense, like a morning walk through the forest. There is sizzling acidity at the start of the sip, which carries light, bright and tangy strawberry flavors along with more forest floor touches. The structure is upright but light."
Efeste,Mourvèdre,92.0,49.0,2,"This 100% varietal wine is a blend of fruit from Grand Ciel (42%), Upchurch (31%), Ciel du Cheval (19%) and Klipsun vineyards. Wound-up aromas of black cherry and barrel spice are followed by pitch-black-fruit flavors, with the tannins combed to a fine sheen. It flat out impresses."
Efeste,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,42.0,3,"Given extended time on lees to add richness and texture, this wine succeeds on every level, showing a brightly exotic nose of floral citrus before allowing nuanced layers of spicy nutmeg, grapefruit, fig and fennel to slow dance on the palate. Rich, it retains enough acidity to remain fresh and lively."
Efeste,Riesling,92.5,19.5,4,"A longstanding estate wine inspired by the producer's Spanish heritage, this shows bright, measured acidity and stainless-steel fermentation, remaining fresh and fleshy in the glass in its offerings of green apple, lime and peach. Thirst-quenching, the fruit flavors are complemented by floral notes of jasmine."
Efeste,Rosé,91.0,21.0,4,"This is an inaugural release from this site, an ocean-viewing, high-elevation perch overlooking the Pacific Ocean that loves the variety. A sanguine element rides a canopy of dense, thick forest floor and dark cherry compote, the tannins and oak sizable and present. A length of cardamom provides a memorable spiciness to the finish."
Efeste,Sauvignon Blanc,91.14,21.57,7,"This needs decanting, but after some air this Pinotage—a rarity in California—bears aromas of dark plum, cherry and leather pouch, followed by a deep root-beer note. Strong in flavor and body, the finish veers bitter before righting itself back on course."
Efeste,Syrah,91.62,40.56,16,"Simple, forward flavors of vanilla syrup and fresh-cut tobacco seem to define the Milbrandt lineup. A tart berry flavor and chocolaty tannins make for a supple, flavorful Merlot."
Ehlers Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,110.0,1,"Produced from estate-grown fruit, this also includes 10% Petit Verdot. A tart raspberry flavor fades into a light finish, with streaks of tobacco and vanilla that are bolstered with generous natural acidity."
Ehlers Estate,Merlot,92.0,55.0,2,"Black-cherry fruit shows on the nose of this bottling by Silicon Valley veterans T.J. and Valeta Rodgers, but it is deftly hidden behind layers of earth and herbs, from dark clay and black pepper to budding violets and rosemary. The acidity is slowly simmering on the palate, unleashing flavors of dark chocolate, cinnamon, more rosemary, blackberry and pencil-lead minerality."
Ehlers Estate,Rosé,91.0,28.0,1,"Deliciously varietal in its huge offering of white pepper and robust black and blue fruit, this well-crafted wine boasts a lithe texture that invites sip after sip. It remains light footed throughout the palate, yet with enough complexity and balancing weight before the refined finish gives a final hit of juiciness."
Ehret,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,48.0,1,"This gorgeous, full-bodied and compelling wine is made from 84% Chardonnay and 16% Pinot Noir. It has a rich golden color, slightly earthy aromas, plus bread dough and white-peach scents that lead to very opulent, sophisticated and nicely aged flavors that range from toasted walnut to honeyed peach to white pepper. While it's already nine years old, this will easily age through 2022."
Ehret,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,75.0,1,"The Novak family continue to produce an understated style of gorgeous Cabernet year in and year out. This vintage provides a fine example, a blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, all from the historic, 40-acre estate. Complex and smooth, it offers an exotic array of cigar, tar, black pepper and currant, the tannins soft and integrated, yet strong. Coffee and chocolate make appearances on the finish, ever so slightly, never at risk of dimming its freshness. Drink now through 2022."
Ehret,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,86.0,48.0,1,"Aromas of plum, black cherry and mulberry are enhanced by crushed graphite, clove dust, scarlet rose petals and menthol on the nose of this bottling. The palate reveals a stunning amount of depth, with eucalyptus leaf, white sage, violet petals, rose hips and pine needles giving depth to the rich black-plum fruit."
Ehret,Meritage,84.0,22.0,1,"Fairly light in color and body, this wine sings in fresh cranberry and orange before revealing a meatier underbelly of black tea and sautéed mushroom. Finessed and vibrant in minerality, it has pretty rose and fresh-picked cherry characters that dance on the palate as it evolves and unravels provocatively in the glass."
Eight Bells,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,35.0,1,"A silky, compelling wine full of minerality, this comes from a gradually sloping site within the larger estate ranch, where the soils are tightly packed and volcanic, and the air often drenched in fog. Silky on the palate, the red-fruit profile is crunchy and juicy, the body medium in terms of strength and length."
Eight Bells,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,35.0,4,"A stunning effort from Beckstoffer's famously gravelly site, this is a 100% varietal wine from one clone, made in a tiny amount. Exquisite aromas of blackberry and leather surround a velvety texture and spiky acidity, the tannins integrated and lengthy, with room to grow over time. Powerfully full bodied, this is a classic representation of the valley in expansive celebration of a ridiculously good vintage. Drink now through 2023."
Eight Bells,Chardonnay,88.0,18.0,1,"This shows a hint of green in its scents and tannins. Firm berry and cassis fruit anchors the palate, with tannins that remain a bit unyielding. Give this one a decanting, and it will soften up. A blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon,"
Eight Bells,Merlot,87.0,21.5,2,"This is a structured, full-bodied, generously layered wine, named for the soil in which its grapevines are grown. This is primarily on hillsides, where the fruit takes on a brooding quality of spiciness and texture. Baked cherry, cranberry and rose petals stand out most, as additional nuances of earthiness come into play in the glass."
Eight Bells,Sangiovese,85.0,20.0,1,"Succulent and thick, with generous fruit flavors of apple, peach, nectarine and pear, this almost-decadent take on Chardonnay breaks the mold for Oregon. With more than a slight nod to California, it brings massive fruit, vanilla cream and barrel toast to the forefront. Drink up while it is young and bursting with fresh flavors."
Eight Bells,Syrah,91.14,32.29,7,"Named for an apple variety once common to the area, this vineyard sits outside the town of Graton in Green Valley and was developed in 2007. Elegant and weighty, it shows a youthful tightness of tannin and oak, its savory twists of black tea, blackberry and rhubarb compote chomping at the bit to be enjoyed. The acidity is mouthwatering."
Eight Bells,White Blend,90.0,16.0,1,"The delightful palate puts rhubarb pie, strawberry jam and cherry compote in play. The wine, at first broad and openly fruity, keeps building upon itself, adding hints of cured meat, smoke and chocolate. Don't quit on it before the extended finish is completely played out; it won't quit on you."
Eisold-Smith,Pinot Noir,88.5,60.0,2,"Smoky, chewy and dense, this is stacked with plum and black-cherry fruit. Strong streaks of cola and dark chocolate add complexity, with lightly dusty tannins supporting the extended finish."
El Lugar,Pinot Noir,90.86,43.71,7,"Juicy hibiscus and pomegranate fruits converge with dried fennel stalks, purple flowers and a flinty smoke character on the fresh and inviting nose of this bottling from Rick Longoria's own vineyard. The energy that emerges on the sip is amazingly persistent, which guarantees long aging, presenting flavors of raspberry, pomegranate, dried sagebrush and black licorice. Drink 2017–2028."
El Pistolero,Chardonnay,88.0,35.33,3,"This big but elegant wine combines abundant fruit and oak flavors with a supple, multi-layered texture. It smells like dark and milk chocolate, mint and plums, and tastes concentrated, fruity and complex. Best after 2020."
El Pistolero,Pinot Noir,92.0,36.0,1,"This blend of 66% Tannat and 34% Petite Sirah by Santa Clarita-based winemakers Steve Lemley and Nate Hasper offers layers of rich flavors without being overdone. Deep aromas of black cherry, boysenberry, mocha and caramel lead into a sip full of blackberry paste, beef char, dried tobacco leather and a cocoa spice. The caramel finish is just delicious."
Elephant Seven,Grenache,86.0,30.0,1,"This is a barrel selection, and as such, may be expected to show extra layers of concentration—more stuffing overall. It's a rich, smoky, lush wine, with a complex mix of red fruits ranging from rhubarb to raspberry to Bing cherries. Spicy highlights and a frame of orange peel also enter the picture. You might wish to give this another couple of years of bottle age before popping the cork. Drink 2018–2025."
Elephant Seven,Syrah,88.5,40.0,2,"This estate-grown wine comes from the vineyard that provides the backbone to the producer's well-known Les Pommiers Pinot Noir. Tart in rhubarb, pomegranate and plush, herb-kissed red fruit, it's juicy and young, complex yet approachable. Full bodied and grainy in tannin, it'll provide years of pleasure for drinkers who can wait."
Elevation Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.67,30.17,6,"From a terrific, old-vine site in the heart of the southern-lying appellation, this is a mild-mannered, juicy wine, structured and balanced despite the abundance of ripe red fruit. Cinnamon and pepper complement the restrained nature of the brambly cherry."
Elevation Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,45.0,2,"This earthy, cool-climate wine is perfumed in a delicate layering of rose and spice, with subtle additions of brown sugar, tart cranberry and rhubarb. The oak is muted and supportive, while the body is light and bright."
Elevation Cellars,Red Blend,87.0,20.0,1,"This old favorite has an excellent new release. A classic style of Zin, it surrounds generous fruit and spice flavors with a firm texture and appetizing tannins. It starts with light black pepper and sage aromas to complement the rich blackberry and raspberry fruit, and finishes with lingering nuances of spice and berry."
Elevation Cellars,Riesling,90.33,17.0,3,"Earthy and brimming with black tea, this is an exotic, medium-bodied wine. The palate starts off tangy in cranberry and strawberry flavors, with a hint of mint, while a forested, mushroomy underbelly provides extra complexity and a savory component."
Elevation Cellars,Tempranillo,87.5,38.0,2,"Black licorice and orange zest star in this high-toned wine from a singular clone. It's moderate in acidity, with a strong presence of fresh lemon that lingers through the finish."
Eleven,Mourvèdre,87.0,35.0,1,"With a clarity of fruit and minerality, this wine is brightly floral and noticeably stony, with highlights of melon, lemon and green apple."
Eleven,Red Blend,87.0,33.0,1,"Sanguine and meaty, this big-shouldered wine from a prime site on Westside Road showcases a ripeness of black cherry accented in forest floor, cola and cardamom. Mellow oak contributes softness to the texture as a length of licorice takes over at the end."
Eleven,Rosé,85.0,20.0,1,"Velvety-smooth and rich in red plum and strawberry, this medium-bodied, varietally honest wine is textured and complex. It's well-crafted and balanced, with a lingering finish."
Eleven,Roussanne,86.0,24.0,1,"Rounded strawberry fruit, clove and vanilla show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling from the Hahn family of wines. Baked red cherry, cocoa spice, nutmeg, allspice and more clove pop on the palate and linger through the close."
Eleven,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,16.0,1,"High-toned aromas of cocoa, barrel spice, vanilla and dark fruit lead to plentiful, focused fruit and barrel flavors. The flavors linger on the finish."
Eleven Eleven,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,111.0,1,"Comprised of 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Merlot, this is a juicy, savory and lengthy wine, with herbaceous elements of cedar, brush and peppercorn. A lush, full-bodied complement of baked plum and cherry ride out a lengthy finish."
Eleven Eleven,Chardonnay,93.0,48.0,1,"This wine has that wonderful but hard-to-pin-down Zinfandel essence that's extremely fruity but also uniquely spicy and brambly. It blends together ripe raspberry, creamy vanilla and red cherry on a smooth, nicely viscous and very full-bodied frame that helps the finish linger."
Eleven Eleven,Pinot Noir,91.0,65.0,2,"Called 3BB because it combines the three best barrels of the vintage, this is an earthy Pinot, soft, round and highlighted in cinnamon spice and electric acidity, especially on the finish. The fruit leans toward darker, lusher black cherry, a flavor that takes some time to develop aromatically."
Eleven Eleven,Syrah,90.0,55.0,1,"A unique wine with notes of smoke, citrus, leather and balsamic. The palate has a lovely texture that only improves with additional time open."
Eli Madyson,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,42.0,1,"Dark black cherry dominates the mood of this wine, lively and light, with a delicate, unexpected punch of spicy cinnamon throughout and a tension of toned oak balanced against the fruit."
Eliana,Rosé,85.0,19.0,1,"Deep purple fruits swirl with marjoram and clove on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling by winemaker Jeff Fink. There's darkness on the palate too, with black loamy flavors alongside sour cherry fruit leather and cardamom-spiced raspberry juice."
Elizabeth Chambers,Pinot Noir,92.08,41.0,13,"Aromatically exuberant, this offers notes of lychee, rose petal, spice and citrus rind. It drinks dry and is lighter in style, with abundant spices speckling a supremely long finish."
Elk Cove,Pinot Noir,91.45,61.41,22,"Light in color and spicy cherry fruit, it offers layers of oak and earth that compete for attention. The wine is a blend of three clones, including Pommard, which reveals itself in the wine's forested and floral character. Concentrated and relatively lush, it should stand the test of time and air; try from 2017–2019."
Elk Cove,Riesling,91.33,19.0,3,"A medium-bodied Pinot Noir that is quite sophisticated, despite the California AVA labeling. It has lots of cherry-berry flavors, great balance, velvety texture and long finish. It is substantial in flavor, smooth, and complete."
Elk Cove,Viognier,88.0,22.0,1,"This was a cool, acidic vintage, and this has a fairly strong herbal streak, along with broad flavors of vanilla and tobacco. The Cabernet fruit falls a bit short of fully ripe, and the oak treatment does not completely mask the bitterness."
Elkhorn Peak,Pinot Noir,87.5,41.0,2,"A rare Washington Nebbiolo, from a recently planted Yakima Valley vineyard, this has young vine flavors of berry candy. It's high-toned and slightly volatile, with some heat in the finish."
Elkhorn Ridge,Pinot Noir,86.0,29.0,2,"A 100% Viognier that's heady in ripe pit fruit, mostly sweet peach, and accented in nutty, floral aromas. It's full-bodied and  robust, with tannins that are soft and juicy."
Elsom Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,34.0,1,"Spice frames the bone-dry red fruit, which carries a sharp, astringent flavor profile into a rather short, tight finish. More cellar time might help to open this up further."
Elsom Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.5,30.0,2,"Pink lemonade and cherry pie mesh together into a strong, slightly boozy aroma on this adventurous blend of 30% Petite Sirah, 30% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 10% Tannat from Matt Villard's Petite Sirah-focused project. Cherry and orange juice dominate the palate."
Elsom Cellars,Red Blend,89.0,43.0,2,"Sourced from Saralee's Vineyard-Matthew Station, it offers indelible savory and herbal notes, a chewy sense of wild strawberry and a drying finish for a curious, more thirst-quenching take on Tannat."
Elyse,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.75,65.0,4,"Quite cloudy due to being unfiltered, it offers subtle lemon peel and chalkboard at first on the nose. Some buttered croissant elements arise as the wine opens up. The mouthfeel is even and soft, with a slight creaminess alongside citrus, peach, and, fittingly, a bit of beeswax. Still very tightly wound, it would go well with a Cobb salad or shrimp Louie."
Elyse,G-S-M,89.0,28.0,1,"This interesting blend holds 67% Grenache and 33% Tempranillo, although the results are a tad thin and reedy, with dried berries, hay, smoke and allspice aromas. The palate is relatively light, with oregano and cherry flavors."
Elyse,Grenache-Syrah,88.0,37.0,1,"Cherry, plum and vanilla aromas and flavors ride a dusty texture in this wine that's beset by astringent tannin and wisps of dried herb."
Elyse,Merlot,93.0,85.0,1,"This is an abundantly ripe wine, big in oak and tannin, with a streak of earthy compost. A tinge of spearmint brightens the palate, while persistent acidity graces the close."
Elyse,Petite Sirah,91.0,37.0,2,"A mix of lemon candy and apple Jolly Rancher overtakes a floral, fruity nose in this medium-bodied, concentrated and creamy wine. A severe streak of acidity shows on the finish."
Elyse,Red Blend,89.0,28.0,3,"Estate-grown Roussanne (63%), Viognier (32%) and Chardonnay (5%) are blended together in a medium-bodied coming-together of floral, light aromatics and supportive acidity. Fruity highlights run the gamut of apricot, peach and lime, with a tiny touch of sweetness on the finish."
Elyse,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.33,28.0,3,"The aromas of milk chocolate, cherry and spice bring immediate appeal. The flavors are silky and polished, showing equal parts fruit and barrel."
Elyse,White Blend,90.5,31.0,4,"The most apt word for this wine is hedonistic, which it is most definitely by design, trafficking in big, soft waves of rich, dense black fruit and mocha-chocolate. It delivers lushness and plenty of power, a formidable wine for formidable situations."
Elyse,Zinfandel,90.67,37.67,3,"Baking spice, vanilla, herb, anise and dark cherry aromas are followed by plump cherry and cocoa flavors. The acidity gives the flavors some snap."
Emerald Hare,Red Blend,85.0,15.0,1,"Cracked pepper, dried blueberries, dried violets and strong bay-leaf aromas show prominently on the nose of this bottling from the southern stretches of the Bay Area. There is solid depth to the flavors, with dill, fennel and a savory, peppery teriyaki element spicing up the blackberry and olallieberry fruit."
Emeritus,Pinot Noir,91.25,51.75,4,"A classic of the genre, this combines a deep color with luscious fruit character and spicy accents on a velvety texture. Firm tannins lend an appetizing grip, while the fresh ripe blackberry, clove and cedar flavors seem to melt on the tongue and linger on the finish. It shows great complexity and balance in a traditional dry style."
Emerson,Pinot Noir,87.0,21.67,3,"This directly appealing wine brings notes of the underside of a pineapple, chamomile, talc, wet stone and apricot, mixing delicacy and nuance. It's creamy in feel with rich, concentrated fruit flavors and a long, detailed finish."
Emerson,Viognier,90.0,20.0,1,"Gingerbread and graham cracker provide this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon with a distinct warmth of character. Elegant, light and restrained, it opens with a prominent rose aroma. It then offers cherry and raspberry delicacy around subtle French oak and vanilla on the palate, all lingering long though the finish."
Emvy Cellars,Red Blend,84.0,40.0,1,"Named after Bill Foley's jingle-writing mother , this wine sings, starting with the starry shine in the glass. Aromas of light salmon brittle turn to apple blossoms, and then a sip reveals sea salt, lemon rind and poached apple, with a nutty macadamia paste note throughout."
En Garde,Albariño,88.0,28.0,3,"This wine from the Rocks District is vibrant, with aromas of smoked meat, flowers, citrus twist and blue fruit. It's packed with soft, flavorful huckleberry and mineral notes that lead to a tart, long fruit-filled finish."
En Garde,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,98.0,1,"This dazzling wine—86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc, 3% Malbec, and 1% Petit Verdot aged in 40% new French oak—offers notes of blackberry, black currant, olive and anise. It's rich and flavorful yet understated with a supple feel and bright acidity. Firm tannins provide the core and a long finish. Just a baby now, this wine should offer drinking pleasure through 2030 or longer."
En Garde,Cabernet Blend,90.0,78.0,1,"Dark and viscous, this greets the nose with expected aromas of raisin and prune, but rises above with nutmeg, cardamom, clove and sleek graphite notes. The first impression on the palate is sweet plum nectar, but the grippy tannins prove seductive and the ripping acidity keeps it quaffable. The fascinating finish is all about chocolate-covered nuts."
En Garde,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.33,96.67,6,"Fascinating aromas and flavors like cedar, grilled rosemary and stewed plums—all of which taste better than they sound—make this very dry wine a treat. It has great aromatic complexity, layers of fruit, spice and savory flavors, good concentration and a very firm texture."
En Garde,Petite Sirah,93.0,38.0,1,"This blend of Merlot (40%), Cabernet Franc (29%), Petit Verdot (18%) and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with quite pure aromas of fresh herbs, flowers, anise and red fruit that are followed by sumptuous red-fruit flavors that show vitality."
En Garde,Pinot Noir,90.31,56.46,13,"Tiny percentages of Syrah and Petite Sirah play minor roles in this vineyard-designate. They add to the soft, juicy and focused concentration of big-boned red fruit, cinnamon and tangy, tart acidity."
EnRoute,Chardonnay,94.5,47.5,2,"Made from Zinfandel, this wine has dark color and an intensity of weight, but also enough of a high-toned taste of fresh tangerine to remain captivating in the glass, refreshing and substantial."
EnRoute,Pinot Noir,92.0,81.4,5,"This wine is a blend of Syrah (64%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. It opens with aromas of freshly brewed coffee and blueberries that lead to plump, silky fruit flavors that linger."
Enkidu,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,35.0,1,"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this well-made white has lively acidity and a linear approach to flavor, focusing clearly on orange, apple and melon around a full-bodied palate. Pear and lime appear on the finish."
Enkidu,Pinot Noir,90.0,52.0,1,"Aromas like cinnamon, cedar and sweet cherries lead to concentrated, lively flavors with tangy cherry and rhubarb notes. Relatively full bodied, the wine has a smooth, mouthfilling texture and a lingering finish that echoes the delicious fruit elements."
Enkidu,Rhône-style Red Blend,86.0,20.0,1,"Herb, flower and espresso bean aromas are followed by a silky textured palate that is still tightly wound. Fine-grained tannins provide the frame. Give it some time to open up."
Enos Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,50.0,1,"This wine is quite aromatic with notes of funk, mineral and dark fruit. The fruit and savory flavors are light bodied, with a mouthwatering quality that keeps the interest high."
Enoteca Five,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,45.0,1,"Olsen and Upland vineyards provide the fruit for this wine. It brings aromas of cedar, herb and blueberry that are followed by a sweet luscious palate backed by lightly grainy tannins."
Enoteca Five,Cabernet Franc,87.0,26.0,1,Aromas of cream and corn on the cob are followed by lively full-bodied fruit flavors with plenty of toasty accents. It offers an appealing sense of texture along with a lovely sense of balance.
Enoteca Five,Petit Verdot,83.0,40.0,1,"All of the fruit for this wine comes from Catherine's Block at Dineen Vineyard. It shows bright fruit-forward aromas of blueberry pie, orange peel, flowers and smoked meat. The flavors are full yet show a sense of restraint, pulling up a bit on the finish."
Enoteca Five,Red Blend,82.0,35.0,1,"Golden in color, this wine opens with a decadent nose of baked apple and raisin bread, and the sweetness of vanilla oak. Full bodied and round on the palate, it balances the richness and concentration with lengthy acidity on the finish."
Enticer,Pinot Noir,92.0,46.0,2,"The Summum block sits at the vineyard's highest elevation, and seems to ripen more slowly and give extra complexity at lower sugar levels. Elegant and refined, with fruit flavors less in your face than its sister cuvées, this mixes citrus flavors of lemon, lime and pink grapefruit, along with lighter suggestions of pineapple and a hint of papaya. It's complex and captivating, with a long, racy finish."
Entropy Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,35.0,1,"This fresh, supple Pinot comes from a cool Russian River Valley site overlapping the Sonoma Coast AVA. Jenkins sits above the fog line and is rich in Goldridge soils. The wine is lightly mushroomy in earth, and a keen streak of exotic spiciness kicks in convincingly on the finish, after intense and complicated layers of red cherry, raspberry and lavender."
Entropy Cellars,Red Blend,88.0,30.0,2,"Deeply funky aromas of salted rhubarb and beets, grilled meats, anise and hot tar greet the nose on this fascinating Pinot Noir. Sanguine, bloody flavors evolve down a line of licorice and slate toward raspberry, with a bit of grilled meat at the very end."
Envolve,Pinot Noir,88.0,65.0,1,"A big, lovable Pinot Noir that is quite ripe and full of exotic fruit flavors that go beyond cherry to boysenberry and blackberry. Full-bodied, with a rounded texture and firm tannins, it is mouthfilling, generous, bombastic and delicious."
Envy,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.67,64.33,3,"Round and rich, this wine takes on renewed complexity in the glass. Seductive in earthy red and black berry fruit and exotic spice, it offers naturally realized structure in a stylized package that should remain interesting for years."
Envy,Petite Sirah,87.0,49.0,1,Fresh smoke from your grandpa's pipe swirls with aromas of cherry pie and cinnamon-vanilla cream on this wine named after the year Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa was founded. Flavors range from Earl Grey tea to crushed violets and frothy blackberry sorbet. Only 22 barrels made.
Envy,Rosé,90.0,24.0,1,"Lush aromatics instantly alert you that this is an exceptional year for this vineyard. Aged in half new French oak, the wine takes it in stride, as it is dense with spicy red berry and plum flavors, and beautifully balanced throughout. Streaks of coffee and nut butter add to the compelling complexity, even at such a young age."
Envy,Sauvignon Blanc,84.0,24.0,1,"A rounded red fruit nose of pomegranate gets savory help from menthol, cinnamon and vanilla on this single clone 115 wine from the southern edge of the appellation. Dried orange rinds and smoked plums lead the broad palate, which picks up black pepper, brown spice and lingering sour cherry on the finish."
Eola Hills,Chardonnay,88.0,30.0,2,"This is the top bottling of Thomas Fogarty's ambitious Bordeaux-aimed brand, and it shows, with regionally distinctive aromas of crushed rocks, blueberry, tar and smoke. The intriguing palate is elegance defined, with sexy tannins and mineral-driven flavors of black dirt, wet slate and squeezed blueberry. It makes for enlightening drinking now, but offers measured components that will last until at least 2030."
Eola Hills,Pinot Noir,87.0,24.5,4,"This 100% Syrah comes from four parcels of high-elevation sites across Sonoma, many of them otherwise single-vineyard designated by the winery. Here, the blending pays off in refined, gamy, sanguine undertones that evolve in the glass to meet mouthfilling black currant, fine-grain leather and white pepper. An acidic lift on the finish balances the wine's power."
Epiphany,Grenache Blanc,89.0,25.0,3,"Don't let the Washington State label fool you. This Walla Walla Valley Rocks-region wine shows complex notes of roasted meat, blue fruit, earth, mineral, smoke and herbs. It's full bodied and rich with a dazzlingly polished feel to the fruit and savory flavors capped off by a long, meat-filled finish—beautiful stuff."
Epiphany,Petite Sirah,90.2,32.6,5,"This wine that Doug Margerum makes from the Los Alamos Valley vineyard owned by Dan and Meghan Reeves presents intriguing complexity on the nose, from violet and rose petals to smashed boysenberry, thyme, rosemary and roasted boar meat. Blueberry, blackberry and black cherry soak the palate, which is evened out by pine sap, cedar, purple flowers and shiitake mushroom-powered umami."
Epiphany,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.22,36.0,9,"This Willow Creek winery hits a home run with this blend of 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of dried black cherries, cola, soy sauce and balsamic reduction are pleasing. The sipping experience is cohesive, with blackberry fruit, black pepper spice, plum skin tartness and an expert amount of tannins."
Epiphany,Rhône-style White Blend,89.0,25.0,1,"This wine from a newer vineyard in the recently named Ballard Canyon appellation offers aromas of boysenberry, black pepper and a judicious amount of creosote. It's elegantly structured along a line of ripe purple to tarry black flavors—think burnt ends of beef tip coated in smashed wild berries and crushed Indian spices."
Epiphany,Roussanne,86.0,25.0,1,"Michael Larner is making savory Syrahs to sit on. This one from 2010 offers perfectly ready black and white pepper scents along with blueberry, black licorice candy and violet flowers. It's viscous on the palate, with mace and all sorts of peppery flavors, picking up a bit of scorched lemon tartness and remaining a bit tannic. This may get even better in years to come."
Epiphany,Syrah,89.9,39.1,10,"Estate grown, this is the only white from the Wayfarer Vineyard out on the Fort Ross-Seaview coast, and it's stunning. Culled from several distinct blocks planted to a handful of clones, including Mt. Eden and Old Wente, the aromas are pretty in orange blossom and peach, the body expansive and flinty. Succulent, the wine offers a lot of layered complexity, making it enjoyable now and through 2020–2022."
Epoch Estate Wines,G-S-M,94.0,65.0,1,"This very substantive wine carries rich and complex flavors on a firm and lively frame.

The elements of ripe cherries, suave oak and vibrant acidity all support each other for great balance and a long finish."
Epoch Estate Wines,Grenache Blend,95.0,65.0,1,"Winemaker David Galzignato is making bold but layered wines from the Willow Creek district, including this blend of 94% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Merlot and 2% Petit Verdot. It offers aromas of cherry-vanilla cream soda with wild mint in the background.

Epoch Estate Wines,Red Blend,93.5,50.0,2,"A blend of Grenache, Syrah and Malbec, this lightly colored wine offers aromas of wild strawberries, coffee, tobacco and incense, showing pleasing purity and nuance. It's light yet palate coating, possessing a mesmerizing texture along with an assortment of fruit and savory flavors."
Epoch Estate Wines,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.2,70.0,5,"Though not labeled as such, this is truly a Red Mountain wine with all of the fruit coming from Ciel du Cheval and Taptiel vineyards. A blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, it shows a mixture of fruit and barrel. Flavors of herbs, plum, oak spices and black currant offer impressive density and finish with a tart lick of acidity."
Epoch Estate Wines,Syrah,94.0,82.5,2,"Aromas of green olive, tapenade, mineral, peat, flowers and earthy funk lead to plum and savory flavors. It's lighter styled and all about elegance of expression, with guava flavors on the finish."
Epoch Estate Wines,Tempranillo,90.0,65.0,1,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend shows aromas of blackberry, red and black currant and barrel spices (100% new French), seeming a bit wound up at present. The fruit and barrel flavors are elegant yet rich with a polished, seamless feel and a warm finish."
Epoch Estate Wines,Zinfandel,89.0,65.0,1,"The six years this wine has had to stretch its legs have been well spent. It shows appealing aromas of chocolate along with dried and fresh dark fruit that lead to rich, ripe flavors. It's in full bloom and ready to drink."
Eponymous,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,65.0,1,"On first pour, this wine is still in its shell with aromas of huckleberries, dried herbs and plums, with savory notes lurking in the background. It's fleshy in feel with plush, pure blue fruit and smoked meat flavors that linger on the finish."
Eponymous,White Blend,87.0,28.0,1,"Delicate, high-toned aromas of tight red raspberries, dried rose petals, pencil shavings and rust introduce this wine by Joshua Klapper. The palate is very alive, linear and focused on a blend of turned earth and brown spice."
Equinox,Chardonnay,90.5,87.5,2,"This wine commands attention with aromas of coffee, milk chocolate, toast, herb and black cherry. The palate has elegant, layered chocolate and cherry flavors, backed by a light squeeze of tannins. Just a baby now, it needs some time in the cellar to be fully appreciated. It will be best from 2018 to 2024."
Equinox,Petit Verdot,91.0,36.0,1,"More than 75% of this wine comes from Ciel du Cheval vineyard, with the rest from Upchurch. A blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, it's reserved at present, with light aromas of woodspice, coffee, assorted dried herbs and mineral.

The palate packs a hefty punch with über rich, dense fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end, leading to a warm, tart finish."
Erath,Pinot Blanc,86.0,22.0,4,"Sharp and tannic, this wine hides its thin fruit behind gluey flavors of tobacco and licorice."
Erath,Pinot Gris,86.67,19.33,3,"Palisade is Merlot-based in 2010, with 11% Cabernet Sauvignon filling out the blend. Muscular and complex, this is Merlot at a level rarely found at this price. Cherry, cassis, earth, graphite and mineral flavors mingle seamlessly. Sourced from a brilliant mix of vineyards including Champoux, Ciel du Cheval, DuBrul and Klipsun."
Erath,Pinot Noir,88.41,42.9,41,"Every bit as good as the dazzling 2009, this is 100% Touriga Nacional grapes. Sappy and acidic, it has extraordinarily deep and succulent flavors of raspberries, along with lush, chocolatey tannins. It's startlingly good, and though entirely ageworthy, almost impossible to ignore at the moment."
Eric Kent,Chardonnay,90.5,45.0,4,"2011 is another excellent vintage for this unique and aromatic blend from Brian Carter. The mix is 51% Viognier, 35% Roussanne and 14% Riesling, and it offers a riot of scents and flavors; a rotating Ferris wheel with lemon skin, beeswax, orange peel, tangerine, succulent lime and ripe pear. It's flat out luxurious, long and lissome."
Eric Kent,Pinot Noir,91.29,51.14,7,"This is a lovely rendering of Syrah from this outstanding Walla Walla vineyard. In terms of depth of flavor and range of detail, it's a fascinating wine sure to provide an evening's pleasure. Sassafras, spiced and cured meat, licorice, espresso, black cherry and cassis whirl through the palate, with excellent concentration and length."
Eric Kent,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,31.0,4,"The Gun Metal red is a Bordeaux-style blend—a smooth, seamless mix of spicy red fruits with new barrel highlights of coffee grounds, toasted walnuts and baking spices. There's a lick of citrus running through it also, a testament to the natural acidity that adds life and lift to Washington state reds."
Eric Kent,Syrah,92.0,45.0,2,"Here is a dark, smoky, meaty Syrah, smooth in the mouth and showing plenty of black cherry fruit. The silkiness plays nicely against flavors that are dark with olive, espresso and cacao, and highlighted with hints of orange peel and pepper."
Eristavi Winery,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,30.0,1,"This fresh, young wine, showcases a palate-thrilling mix of ripe tree fruits—sappy apples, juicy citrus—and some hints of pineapple as well. The ripeness turns the lemony fruit into limoncello, and the finish is long and wonderfully refreshing."
Ermisch,Pinot Noir,90.33,31.67,3,"This combines 53% Zinfandel with 45% Syrah and 3% Grenache, all from the producer's historic estate. Expansive with fresh, juicy blackberry, coffee and leather notes, it has black pepper and cinnamon accents that contribute extra verve to the robust body and fleshy ripeness."
Ernest,Pinot Noir,92.0,45.5,2,"Intensely dark and focused, this bottling from Santa Barbara County's historic vineyard is unrivaled in intensity, showing mulberry, elderberry, crushed rock, roast beef and a hint of sagebrush. Full but not sweet boysenberry flavors come through on the palate, balanced by dusty earth, wet stone and more chaparral spice notes."
Ernest & Julio Gallo,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,95.0,1,"This vintage of the famous proprietary wine is made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, a testament to how much the winemakers loved the variety on its own in this year. Root beer, cola and red plum notes make up its core of flavor, the texture velvety-soft. With its firm structure and clove accents, it will benefit from further time in bottle. Enjoy 2023–2033."
Ernest & Julio Gallo,Chardonnay,93.0,50.0,1,"An underpinning of soft, grippy tannin carries lingering red currant and cranberry flavors in this full-bodied, unabashedly ripe reserve-level wine. Cola and leathery earth notes combine to boost and contrast the fruit, which persists long into the finish."
Ernest & Julio Gallo,Pinot Noir,89.5,95.0,2,"Made from biodynamically grown grapes, this wine is remarkably floral, high-toned and rewarding—a complex commingling of anise, green apple and grapefruit flavors. A gravelly texture gives it context and supports the lingering, succulent acidity."
Esser,Syrah,87.0,12.0,1,"This bold and distinctive wine from an outstanding vineyard in the Marin County hills has exotic blackberry and pine needle aromas, vivid and concentrated black cherry flavors and a focus that's unmatched. It's layered and persistent, with a luxurious tide of ripe fruit, moderate tannins and a nicely viscous texture."
Estancia,G-S-M,87.0,25.0,1,"This wine is rich to the edge of voluptuousness. Delicious nutty, toasty and buttery flavors are wrapped around ripe apricot and papaya fruit. A full-bodied, complex wine, it was aged for a year in 55% concrete eggs, 25% stainless and 20% French oak barrels."
Estancia,Meritage,87.0,30.0,2,"A fascinating wine, it was processed in a carbonic fashion, in which the juice is allowed to ferment inside the mostly intact grape skins, much like what's done in Beaujolais. The result is a transparent, ruby red wine that offers scents of a dust storm mixed with crushed rock and chile pepper herbaciousness. It's warm and soft on the mouth with a presence that suggests something between peppercorns and bell peppers."
Estate 1856,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,42.0,1,"Ripe raspberry, slight minerality, mossy earthiness and a minty lift kick off this offering. On the palate, expect sour cherry, mocha and a pleasing espresso finish bolstered by tingling acidity. Though 2010 was considered a less-than-optimal year, the vintage look like a shining star now that wines like this have had time to come into their own."
Estate Crush,Cinsault,89.0,24.0,2,"Kathleen Inman has gained such a following with her Rosé that she's given it a special designation, a nod to her happy marriage. Made in a direct-press style, the dry, refreshing wine is light salmon in color and marked by aromatic grapefruit and strawberry, mouthfilling and juicy as a slice of watermelon in summer."
Estrin,Red Blend,87.0,25.0,1,"Los Gatos-based Testarossa is building a powerful reputation as a single-vineyard specialist, but this more accessibly priced cuvée from Monterey County rivals their best efforts. There is nuttiness, brioche and slightly sour orange on the nose, followed by a very soft mouthfeel, with flavors of pound cake, vanilla cookie, peach cobbler and candied grapefruit."
Et Fille,Pinot Noir,86.75,44.5,4,"LVdM is shorthand for Les Vignes de Marcoux, a newer planting near Red Willow. Done in a lovely, savory style, it offers a mix of leaf, herb and earth components, rather than supersweet fruit. Graceful and detailed, it discloses pepper and iron ore minerality."
Eternal,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,30.0,2,"Funky earth tones of forest floor, brown button mushrooms and aged beef rise as leading scents in this Rhône-style blend. The nicely rounded, velvety palate, which emerges steadily over the course of a sip, offers plum flavors and soft but present tannins, representing a wine that could last a few more years."
Eternal,Grenache Blanc,88.0,30.0,1,"The most affordable offering in the Clos de la Tech portfolio, it offers cinnamon and other baking spices plus caramel on the nose. These are followed by a palate rich in cola nut, cranberry, tar and cherry flavors. Like its sister wines, this is loaded with tannins, so expect steady evolution and improvement through 2019."
Eternal,Rosé,88.0,21.0,1,"With brooding aromas ranging from wild crushed berries to clove to wet clay, the palate features layers upon layers of flavor, and the wine coats the mouth like silk. Cherries, cola and other savory elements come with a slight tannic grip that ensures a few more years to enjoy this wine."
Eternal,Roussanne,90.0,40.0,1,"A pleasing, well-crafted Riesling in a lighter, elegant mode, this brings a delicate stone-fruit flavor into a mix of mineral and breakfast tea highlights. The moderate alcohol makes it an ideal summer sipper."
Eternal,Syrah,90.0,60.0,3,"This has a strong current of spearmint, cedar and eucalyptus running throughout, but it is nicely balanced against the blackberry and raspberry tones. It's light in tone and should be fine with food."
Eternal,Viognier,91.0,35.0,1,"This is an austere, very structured, leathery Zin, with notes of briary black pepper and dark, ripe fruit from start to finish."
Etude,Chardonnay,90.0,41.33,3,"Textured and lengthy, this full-bodied reserve-level wine is soft and round on the palate, expressive in black olive, black cherry, mocha and vanilla. It offers impressive richness and leathery grit on the palate."
Etude,Pinot Noir,90.82,58.27,11,"This is a tiny production wine, nutty on the nose in almond paste and an intensity of forest floor and earth. Still gritty in its youth, it shows a soft and delicate nature at its core, accented in rose petal and a persistent streak of minerality complemented by a richness of deep dark red cherry."
Eufloria,Rosé,88.0,12.0,1,"From an estate site, this wine offers power and concentration. Creamy in texture, the generosity of fruit is balanced by notes of stone, toasted oak and French butter, making for a wonderfully complete experience on the palate."
Eufloria,White Blend,88.25,12.5,4,"This bottling from the Scheid family, one of the region's largest growers, shows aromas of baked red cherry in a vanilla pie crust as well as marjoram, bay leaf and cinnamon. The palate balances tart and ripe cranberry and pomegranate with both dried and fresh herbs."
Eugene Wine Cellars,Pinot Noir,89.0,20.0,1,"Heavy licorice bombards the nose on this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 14% Merlot, 8% Merlot and 8% Petit Verdot, but there is plenty of cassis, fudge, brandy and mint to add complexity. Solid acid and firm tannins grab the palate's attention immediately, allowing blackberry, dried herbs and a rocky minerality to converge cleanly."
Evening Land,Chardonnay,92.25,52.5,4,"Fresh and broad aromas of strawberry syrup meet with eucalyptus oil and wild mint on the clean if simple nose of this bottling. It grows more tart on the sip, with roasted red plum, cranberry and pomegranate, but the fascinating parts are the curious hints of cannabis and hops, which give herbal depth to the fruit."
Evening Land,Gamay,90.0,35.0,1,"This wine offers high-toned cherry amidst a fresh, acidic backbone. The secondary characteristics are defined by cedar, forest floor, coffee and leather. Light in body, this is a great crowd pleaser."
Evening Land,Gamay Noir,86.0,25.0,1,"Aromatic fruit and floral notes join delicious honeydew melon flavors as this full-bodied wine wraps around the tongue, leaving a soft smooth impression and lingering on the finish. Very good concentration, layers of flavor and that lasting finish lift this wine above the ordinary."
Evening Land,Pinot Noir,92.0,57.0,5,"This wine has great potential to emerge as a classic in the years to come, but is a bit tightly wound right now. Hearty roasted plum and blackberry aromas are coated in smoke, chocolate shavings and subtle violet on the nose. The sip starts bright before the strong tannins take hold, hiding the dark berry and minty flavors."
Everett Ridge,Zinfandel,90.0,22.0,1,"From the mighty mountainous site, this 100% varietal wine is densely compact and thick, with a lift of acidity that keeps it fresh despite its power. Black currant, black cherry, graphite and sage combine effortlessly to provide fruit and complexity."
Evergreen,Pinot Noir,87.0,32.0,1,"At 600-feet in elevation, this is the site that's behind a wine of structure and considerable power. A thick rich layering of currant and blackberry is soft with a tannic backbone. Clove and tobacco contribute secondary aspects of complexity."
Evergreen,Riesling,88.0,17.0,1,"This barrel fermented Viognier delivers an intense nose mixing scents of flowers (lily of the valley), lime skin, green pineapple and a dash of papaya. Cool, crisp and utterly delicious, it is a perfect sipping wine, elegantly structured and under 14% alcohol."
Everhart Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,45.0,1,"This wine greets you with evocative scents that showcase Carmenère's leafy, herbal nature without becoming too raw or vegetal. The fruit is subdued and tart; the flavors are spicy and very peppery and lead into tannins that have the scrapey austerity of green tea. It's 100% varietal and brings both the good and the challenging flavor aspects of the Carmenère grape."
Everhart Cellars,Red Blend,89.0,29.0,1,"From the vineyard that helped propel the appellation's reputation into the stratosphere, this wine delivers both in terms of its historical significance, but also in present-day refinement and complexity. A flinty, earthy layer of black truffle and coffee open the aromatic profile of the wine before offering bold, brawny flavors of leather and black currant. The oak is well integrated and the tannins sizable yet behaved. This is a beautiful wine."
Everhart Cellars,Zinfandel,89.33,25.33,3,"Concentrated in black currant and clove, this is a soft, silky wine, lengthy and substantial without ever becoming overbearing in terms of power or oak. Lovely anise accents the crisp fruit, providing a worthy example of the appellation and clean winemaking coming together in an elegant way."
Evesham Wood,Pinot Noir,86.0,36.0,1,"Strawberry syrup, scarlet-red rose petals, warm licorice-laced cookies and dried sage combine for a brilliant nose from this reliably exciting vineyard, planted by a longtime cattle ranching family. Flavors of raspberry torte and ripe red fruits float across the palate, with added complexity from lifting mint and lively yeast elements."
Ex,Chardonnay,91.0,19.0,1,"The winery's top estate-grown Cabernet, meticulously crafted to age, this is pungent in cardamon and clove, wrapped around hardbound layers of blackberry and raspberry. Elegant and refined, with chalky tannins that will further soften over time, it offers a polished, elegant expression of dried cherries, dark chocolate and brown sugar to round out the finish. This beautiful wine should continue to show well through 2030–2040."
Expression 34,Pinot Noir,93.0,50.0,1,"A fruity nose of red currants and cooked cherries shows how well Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton achieve balance amidst ripeness. The palate allows a little raspberry juice, yet is powered by dill, licorice, wet sagebrush, anise and pencil lead, proving savory and supple all at once."
Expression 38,Chardonnay,91.0,39.67,3,"Raspberry and cinnamon spice hit the nose first followed by crushed cloves on this supremely balanced wine by Gavin Chanin from a vineyard that's northwest of the Sta. Rita Hills. Dried cranberry fruit leads the palate, but it's mostly powered by a potpourri of brown spices, from peppercorns to nutmeg. It's a study of restrained ripeness that's fresh and tasty."
Expression 38,Pinot Noir,90.33,52.67,6,"Ripe cherry aromas swirl into graphite minerality, sweet wood and sagebrush scents in this delicious Jim Clendenen wine. The density on the palate is just about perfect, as is the tannic tension and mouth-cleansing acidity, with rich flavors of chemise, very ripe raspberry and elderberry juice proving quite sultry and addictive."
Expression 44°,Pinot Noir,93.0,50.0,1,"Spicy and leathery, this lovely wine unfolds with waves of red and blue fruit, from cassis to huckleberry and blueberry pie. Balanced and elegant, it has a substantive, complex finish, revisiting its black pepper introduction around a finely tuned finale of herb. Enjoyable now, it will take on deeper complexity through 2022."
FEL,Pinot Noir,89.75,65.0,4,"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Franc is the Creston winery's top-end offering, and it's beautiful. Aromas of blueberry, black cherry, turned earth and roasted vanilla bean meet with violet and sweet rose florals that keep you sniffing. It's dense on the palate but not overly ripe, with black-rock minerality and leather laid across blueberries and prime rib elements. The tannins are present but not in the way at all."
Failla,Chardonnay,92.33,50.67,3,"This challenging island vineyard, planted in 2007, delivers a stunningly delicate but ripe wine, with aromas of smashed cranberry and strawberry pairing perfectly to sarsaparilla and sautéed oyster mushroom elements. The continually emerging palate shows dried citrus peels, iron and sour cherries, along with riper raspberry and pomegranate juice flavors and a spicy edge."
Failla,Pinot Noir,90.5,48.25,4,"Crushed blackberries compete with a hearty bouquet of violet in this gigantically powerful and structured wine. Soft and leathery, it features spikes of black pepper, vanilla and pungent black earth amid a dense, concentrated finesse of tannin and oak, with a lengthy finish awaiting. This is power at its best, a reflection of an idyllic vintage in the hands of a skilled producer."
Falcone,Cabernet Sauvignon,95.0,50.0,2,"There's a lemony leanness to this exquisite wine, from one of the most esteemed vineyards in its region, a site the producer has worked with for more than 20 years. Balanced, it opens with inviting aromas of white flowers and orange peel before delving into complex layers of fresh citrus, ginger snap and lavender."
Falcone,Red Blend,93.67,65.0,3,"This is introduced by scents of rose and cherry blossoms, with a hint of butterscotch. Once tasted it's a lush, forward, sweetly appealing wine with the impressive fruit concentration of the 2012 vintage, underscored with a layer of mineral. It's delicious already, but destined to improve. Drink some now, and put away some to taste between 2018 and 2025."
Falcor,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,55.0,1,"Just a single barrel was produced. Volatile and slightly vinegary at first, it improves with aggressive swirling. The fruit remains quite tart, almost to the point of being sour, with little varietal character."
Falcor,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,65.0,1,"Marked by both reduction and oak, this wine feels lifted with acidity, opening in a vibrant shock of strawberry and Mandarin orange. Velvety layers subtle tannin carry a spicy finish of clove and salty sea air. A beautifully balanced, complete wine."
Falkner,Red Blend,91.33,45.33,3,"This riveting wine displays the exceptional finesse and precision that fruit from this AVA can deliver. It's Pinot Noir expressed in the most subtle and demanding way. Beautifully orchestrated red fruits, sappy acids, lush spices, perfect balance and an immaculate mineral-soaked finish are all on display. Drink 2018 through 2030."
Falkner,Syrah,92.0,43.0,1,"This wine from Jordan Fiorentini is a stunning study in how to achieve extreme richness with elegance. Deep black cherry, violet, espresso, milk chocolate and vanilla pastry show on the nose. On the palate, chalky, soft tannins bring forth baked blueberry, star anise and clove flavors, with floral tones and acidic lift on the finish."
Fall Line,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.17,32.0,6,"This is possibly the most savory rendition of Syrah made on the Central Coast, each vintage as feral as the last. This bottling shows bloody lamb, crushed peppercorn, soy and barnyard elements on the nose. The palate is tense with tarry structure, revealing unusual kelp, stewed peppercorn, black miso and teriyaki flavors."
Fall Line,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,30.0,2,"An extra dollop of toasty oak amplifies the deep black-cherry core. Cedar, pipe tobacco, espresso and dark chocolate highlights wrap around and through the finish. This is a wine with power, precision and exceptional detail. Drink now through the mid-2020s."
Fall Line,Red Blend,88.25,28.0,4,"This wine shows a high degree of spiciness with a rose petal-like flourish—a stellar first effort from a new estate vineyard along Eastside Road. Brambly raspberry and dark cherry flavors seem brushed by a subtle waft of campfire smoke and molten chocolate, all swirling together in the glass as a lengthy, lively palate framed by acidity."
Fallbrook,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,33.0,1,"The spice, green herb, cedar, pepper and purple-fruit aromas are brooding and reserved, with a sprinkling of vanilla rounding it out. The elegant fruit and savory flavors show a fine sense of polish, with puckering tannins supporting it all. The focus is on elegance."
Fallbrook,Merlot,88.33,21.67,3,"Allspice, ginger, Red Vines and red-fruit aromas are out front on this Cabernet Sauvignon (80%) dominant wine. The palate possesses weight and suppleness to the mouthfeel, with lightly grainy tannins providing the frame."
Fallbrook,Red Blend,88.0,39.67,3,"Leather, smoked beef, beef jerky and black currant aromas show on the nose of this smoky bottling, whose name is a nod to one of the historic Hearst Ranch's old cowboy camps. Smoked meat and coffee-crusted beef roast arise on the palate, alongside dried oregano, dried cherries, brown coffee and milk chocolate lushness."
Fallbrook,Syrah,82.0,33.0,1,"An unusually light California Pinot, this wine has lively grape and herb aromas and fresh but lean flavors that make it appetizing while being restrained in personality. It offers a good balance of fruit, acidity and mild tannins."
Fallon Place,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,42.0,1,"This is an imposing, enormous style of wine that smells minty, tastes dense and ripe, and feels massive due to full body and layers of fine tannins. It will be fun to drink with grilled lamb chops or something equally rich, where all the tannin and flavor will meet their match."
Fallon Place,Chardonnay,88.0,38.0,1,"Big-boned, this wine is juicy and herbal, a nice mixture of pipe tobacco and rustic, brawny blackberry and sage."
Fallon Place,Zinfandel,87.0,32.0,1,Malbec is an extreme rarity in this tiny appellation. This one brings quite light cherry and spice aromas followed by quite sweet cherry flavors. It brings appeal but one wants more aromatically.
Far Niente,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.33,160.0,3,"Tropicality rules the roost on this wine, which offers peach, papaya, apricot, mango, coconut and even banana aromas on the nose. Ripe apples, cherimoya and poached peach show on the palate. It's all a little bit much, but not overdone, with enough restraint to achieve balance."
Fazeli Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,47.0,2,"Concentrated berry aromas meet with bubblegum and hibiscus on the simple and pleasant nose of this pink bottling from the winery's Los Alamos Ranch, which Louis Lucas planted decades ago. The palate shows tart pink grapefruit juice, but is rounded out by a soft texture."
Fazeli Cellars,Red Blend,90.14,40.14,7,"Young and fragmented, this displays zigzag streaks of acid, purple plum, sour raspberry, citrus and wet rock. Time may well pull it together: at the moment it's a potpourri of not quite pulled together components."
Fazeli Cellars,Shiraz,88.0,56.0,1,"Referring to the old-time pronunciation of this Rhône red in California, this wine is awash in flavors of baked plum, maple syrup and dried cherry, akin to raisin cake. The ripeness and rusticity are wrapped in tight, firm tannins that grip on the finish."
Feather,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,95.0,1,"A deep color, ripe fruit flavors and a richly tannic texture make this full-bodied wine mouth-filling and satisfying without being heavy. A nice, moderate, spicy oak layer under the blackberries and a hint of pepper add welcome complexity."
Feist,Barbera,89.0,32.0,1,"This blend combines 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Syrah. Fat, juicy and tart, it's robust in oak and meaty leather, its tannin profile grippy and tight. A background note of dried herb and cedar add to the classic touch in style."
Feliz Noche,Rosé,87.0,20.0,1,"Hints of tropical fruit, yellow pear and apricot show on the nose of this bottling by a Sierra Foothills-based producer. There is a slight sweet touch to the sip, but then it dries out nicely, offered pear, apple and honeysuckle flavors against a decent textural grip."
Fenestra,Alvarelhão,85.0,18.0,1,"From Shauna Rosenblum, the daughter of Rosenblum Winery's founder, comes this pyrazine-forward bottling, which may wow sommeliers but could confuse the public. The nose is both grape-y and peppery with garden herbs, and then the palate is tart and tangy, which is odd for a Cab. Yet the high-acid approach makes for a bright, stylish and savory wine, worth seeking out a sip."
Fenestra,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,84.5,41.0,2,"Herb, flower and exotic spice aromas lead to broad creamy-feeling fruit flavors that persist on the finish."
Fenestra,Cabernet Franc,87.0,26.5,2,"Sourced from the Gamble Ranch in Oakville, this is a fleshy, full-figured wine, floral in honeysuckle and voluptuous in youthful oak. Gravensteins apple is overtaken by the richness of butterscotch and tropical pineapple before a brightness comes to life on the finish."
Fenestra,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,30.0,1,"This wine comes from an up-and-coming vineyard site. Very varietal aromas of black cherry, herb and cedar give way to soft fruit flavors and lightly grainy tannins. The tart acidity keeps the interest high. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
Fenestra,Chardonnay-Semillon,84.5,17.0,2,"An estate bottled Pinot, this wine is inviting in floral and fruity characteristics, offering concise layers of red cherry, rose petals and a spark of oak that builds in intensity through the finish. This is a nice place to start on the winery's lineup of Carneros-Napa Valley Pinot Noir."
Fenestra,Grenache,87.5,27.5,2,"The Dundee Hills cuvée shows the tight, tart, higher acidity that is characteristic of the 2011 Pinots from the Willamette Valley. It spent 16 months in 45% new barrels and offers raspberry and cranberry fruit with grippy tannins and a mineral base. Drink now though 2025."
Fenestra,Malbec,88.33,25.67,3,"This cool vintage helps keep the alcohol down, but the seductive aromatics more than compensate. Varietal nuances of rosewater and other floral overtones enhance a rather delicate, elegant reserve. Raspberry fruit and highlights of baking spices continue through a persistent finish."
Fenestra,Mourvèdre,89.0,27.0,2,"The winery's high-end cuvée, this is a five-barrel blend, three of the barrels new. Dancing in cardamom and dark cherry, the background ripe and toasty, the flavors are exotic and long lingering. There's a tension and intensity to this wine that bests speaks to aging, or a full decant; either way, it'll be delicious."
Fenestra,Petit Verdot,88.0,33.0,1,"Light-bodied and yet offering a depth of complexity, this is resplendent in rhubarb and spicy anise, layered and textured in silky waves of fleshy flavor. A well balanced and approachable selection that's enjoyable now."
Fenestra,Petite Sirah,87.5,26.5,4,"Willful is the reincarnation of Daedalus, launched with this 2012 vintage. All Pommard clone and 95% estate-grown, this aromatic, welcoming wine brings nuanced black cherry and cola scents and flavors into focus. Lightly spiced, rather soft and open, it's a lovely example of the strengths of the 2012 vintage."
Fenestra,Port,89.75,33.0,4,"Here is an austere Pinot Noir that's both elegant and high-toned. The flavors mix black cherry and blueberry, while the finish is blithely earthy and herbal. A nice choice for mealtimes of an equally elegant nature, or an easy lunch of BLTs."
Fenestra,Red Blend,88.33,28.17,6,"This wine seems slightly past peak with aromas of overripe apple, lees and pear. It's lightly sweet with the concentration not seeming all there."
Fenestra,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,31.0,2,"A dense, bombshell of a blend, this is comprised of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache. This tannic beast is somewhat reduced and chewy, committed entirely to meat, tobacco and leathery flavor."
Fenestra,Syrah,92.0,28.0,2,"Black plum, boysenberry and fig flavors fill this soft and generous wine. It has a medium-red color, medium body and very fruity aromas. A relaxed, broad texture makes it easy to drink."
Fenestra,Sémillon,86.0,15.0,1,"The oak is at the fore on this wine, with aromas and flavors of vanilla, dill and baking spices in front of cherry and green pepper. The aromas give a sense of some oxygen exposure."
Fenestra,Tempranillo,87.0,23.0,1,"This nonvintage blend of Riesling, Gewürztraminer and Chenin Blanc has pleasing aromas of rose petals, pink grapefruit and spice. It drinks sweet with a fleshy feel."
Fenestra,Touriga Nacional,86.0,24.0,1,"Richly fruity, this wine has a smooth texture and well-concentrated black-plum flavors along with a lightly spicy, bread dough accent that adds interest. It's a touch sweet and supported by light tannins."
Fenestra,Verdelho,88.2,15.8,5,"Light fresh aromas and flavors along with decent balance make this wine a versatile drink. The flavors are faint but clean, so it makes a good palate cleanser and should work well for a crowd."
Fenestra,White Blend,87.6,18.6,5,"Merlot and Sangiovese make up nearly equal parts of this wine, with smaller amounts of Montepulciano, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Cola, vanilla and cherry are walled within full-bodied weight and tannin, with a simple structure and finish."
Ferguson Crest,Red Blend,92.0,40.0,1,"Smoky oak surrounds robust black fruit, peppercorn and a soft, supple core of easygoing texture and rounded richness. The fruit is sourced primary from the relatively cool Oak Knoll District."
Ferguson Crest,Syrah,90.0,35.0,1,"Elégance is a five-grape Bordeaux-style blend, sourced from a single vineyard. Sweet oak scents waft up from the glass, a lush melding of various toasts, over pretty raspberry flavors. The wine is sensuous and elegant, already quite drinkable, and seems to slip away gently before you are quite ready for it to leave."
Ferrari-Carano,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,53.5,2,"The Reveler is Revelry's mainstay blend, a mix of roughly equal parts of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot. Floral and powdered sugar scents lead into a light and pretty palate, showcasing red berry flavors and a touch of minerality."
Ferrari-Carano,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,73.33,3,"From an estate-farmed vineyard, this medium-bodied wine is earthy and aromatic in baked bread, with soft, moderate acidity. With length and breadth, it shows a tartness of black tea and stems, finishing in oak."
Ferrari-Carano,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,89.0,70.0,1,"The RR wines receive special packaging, but little technical information is provided. Though this is a 2013, it's of a piece with the winery's 2014 Pinots, which is to say that lemony acids and a plethora of herbal components overshadow the fruit. There are hints of wild berry, and a finish with light suggestions of chocolate."
Ferrari-Carano,G-S-M,87.0,39.0,1,"The wet-cement aroma is strong in this bottling that also shows mowed lawn and scratched lemon skin on the nose. The zesty flavors convey freshly cut grass, lime skin and tart kumquat, rather than being rounded with stonefruit."
Ferrari-Carano,Red Blend,87.5,22.0,2,"The deep orange-gold color makes this wine look like a late-harvest version, and fragrant floral and apricot aromas continue that impression. But the wine is dry, light-bodied, somewhat tannic and chewy in texture and nutty in flavor. It fits the distinctive Donkey & Goat style of skin-contact, non-intervention winemaking."
Ferriere Vineyards,Cabernet Franc,87.0,30.0,1,"Sharply-defined with a lemony edge, this mixes fruit flavors of tart red berry and citrus. As it breathes it seems to develop some high-toned aromatics bordering on nail polish. Drink up."
Fess Parker,Chardonnay,92.3,37.9,10,"What's not to like about this extremely fruity, easy-drinking Rhône-style blend? It smells and tastes like blackberry jam, with a lightly tannic texture. A touch of sweetness keeps it soft."
Fess Parker,Pinot Noir,91.31,55.12,32,"Smooth and accented by dried herb, this wine is tart in currant and lush in chocolate, offering a wide spectrum of aroma and flavor. Medium bodied, it picks up power and concentration on the finish, allowing for a ripeness to strike last."
Fess Parker,Red Blend,87.67,35.0,3,"This is remarkable, with modest alcohol and a concentrated, ageworthy structure. Lime and pineapple flavors are enhanced with lively, gin-like botanicals. There is vivid acidity and a lick of butterscotch on the finish."
Fess Parker,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,19.5,2,"This is a unique and quirky blend, but so seductive. Half Sangiovese and half Cabernet Franc, it strikes an Italian pose, with scents and flavors of tobacco and sour cherry backed with lip-smacking acidity. The Cabernet Franc lends prune, plum and coffee notes."
Fess Parker,Riesling,89.33,24.0,3,"Grown in what might be the coolest climate Syrah vineyard in the state, this bottling is ferociously peppery on the nose, where tar, elderberry and seedy huckleberry scents add to its dark aromatic profile. Pepper and tar show on the palate as well, alongside purple flower and espresso bean flavors, with a slight caramel touch on the finish."
Fess Parker,Syrah,90.0,49.0,5,"This is a deep, intense and focused wine sourced from 40-year-old vines. Its 28 g/l of residual sugar is all but buried in bright acids, creating tension and depth. Grapefruit, lime and pineapple flavors burst through, making this highly cellar-worthy wine irresistible already."
Fess Parker,Viognier,91.0,36.0,1,"Compost, earth and spicy cardamom notes provide the savory intrigue of this full-bodied, expressive wine, with additional pine forest, pomegranate and orange peel flavors that add to its complexity and appeal. Sourced from several vineyards in the heart of the appellation, it represents the vintage and the location well."
Fesstivity,Rosé,91.0,40.0,1,"Juicy, tart and crisp with acidity, this is a standout vineyard designate with a bold, velvety texture. Blue fruit-driven, it's full-bodied and fleshy in all the best ways, with a plush finish that teases with cardamom and tea."
Fesstivity,Sparkling Blend,90.0,45.0,1,"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this wine offers perfumed, intense aromas of boysenberry, tar, mineral, smoked meat and fresh flower. The palate boasts dense, seamless purple and black-fruit flavors that sail on the finish. It's a standout example of the variety."
Festival and Feast,Pinot Noir,87.0,24.0,1,"As reliable as the first flowers of spring, this perennial best-of-show winner offers lovely scents and flavors of fresh-picked strawberries. Subtle suggestions of rose water and orange peel can be found, along with some precise fruit-skin flavors."
Fetzer,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.75,16.25,4,"This reserve Cabernet is moving quickly toward full maturity, with a rich blend of cassis, figs and prunes, layered with streaks of stem and earth flavors. The tannins are beginning to dry out; it's a wine to drink up while it's at its peak."
Fetzer,Chardonnay,85.5,10.0,2,"Now sourced from the estate vineyard on Red Mountain, this exceptional rosé includes portions of Counoise, Cinsault and Grenache. Though the pale, coppery pink shade suggests a light wine, this is fragrant and full-bodied, with salmonberry and strawberry fruit, light spice and excellent length."
Fetzer,Gewürztraminer,86.67,10.33,3,"Sourced entirely from the Olsen vineyard, macerated on the skins for six weeks, and aged 10 months in neutral oak, this “orange” wine is bone dry, with head-turning aromas of orange liqueur, rose petals and citrus peel. Sip it slightly chilled as a warm weather apéritif."
Fetzer,Merlot,88.0,10.0,5,"Tre blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah from three vineyards in three different AVAs. Tasted just after being released, it showed good balance and flavors of cherries and spice, with some herbal threads running through the tannins."
Fetzer,Pinot Noir,87.0,15.0,1,"From grapes predominantly grown in the Oak Knoll District, this has a dusty herbaceousness. It was given plenty of time in French oak, a sensation that is pronounced on the palate and somewhat distracting."
Fetzer,Red Blend,86.0,12.0,1,"Just a tiny bit of cherry fruit shows on this wine's nose, which is otherwise focused on slate minerality and sagebrush herbals. The palate is soft but not very dynamic, with tight raspberry and flintiness as well as decent acidity and tannins. It finishes quickly."
Fetzer,Riesling,85.0,10.0,2,"Light fruit flavors suggest pomegranate and strawberry, with a little hit of nougat and coconut from time in (almost) neutral wood. It's a well-balanced effort, one that does not overreach for power in this light vintage."
Fetzer,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,10.0,4,"This bright and vivid wine has fresh raspberry and cherry aromas, concentrated fruit flavors and a texture that has enough tannin and acidity for good balance. It's nicely made in a traditional dry style."
Fiddlehead,Pinot Noir,92.0,59.0,6,"There's a lightness to this 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot that surprises, making for a friendly, approachable entry. Cassis, raspberry and cedar mix around rounded tannins and a medium-length finish."
Fiddlehead,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,34.0,2,"The nose on this wine by oil worker-turned-winemaker Ert Sevtap offers lifting aromas of blueberry and mint. The spearmint notes carry to the palate as well, which also shows blackberry fruit and roasted beef meatiness."
Fiddlehead Cellars,Pinot Noir,91.0,22.0,1,"Aromas are dominated by oak with accents of vanilla, cocoa and woodspice along with cranberries, rose hips, herbs and raspberries. The palate is elegant with herb and cherry flavors that lead to a tart, cranberry-filled finish."
Fiddlehead Cellars,Sparkling Blend,89.0,60.0,1,This single-vineyard wine offers wild blueberry with vanilla and herb accents. It's full bodied and high-octane in feel with the flavors running straight down the fairway.
Fiddletown Cellars,Barbera,89.0,29.5,4,"Grass and gooseberry are prominent on the nose and palate in this crisp SB, bright in dialed-high acidity. That sense of vibrant freshness mellows somewhat midway through the wine, allowing it to finish with a lushness on the tongue."
Fiddletown Cellars,Red Blend,88.5,43.0,4,"Named for the winery's co-proprietor and founder, Lynn's is powerfully graceful, much like the man himself, offering seamless texture and length. Full bodied and complex, it's structured and ripely satisfying in its mix of black tea, grenadine and feral evocations of a walk in the woods."
Fiddletown Cellars,Zinfandel,92.5,34.0,2,"There's an elegant weave to the aromas of this bottling, with soy, dried dill, peppercorns, crushed gravel and a touch of cedar laced throughout the black fruit on the nose. Perfectly rounded black currant, black cassis and black cherry fruits show on the sip, which is leveled by violets and pencil shavings."
Fidelitas,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.83,43.67,6,"Pommard and 777 clone grapes were cofermented and aged in a single new Allier oak barrel. Ripe, round and bursting with flavor, this luscious wine is a paean to blackberry fruit. Veins of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate weave through the extended finish. Cellar this for another few years if you can keep your hands off it, but know that it is almost too good to wait for."
Fidelitas,Cabernet Franc,89.0,50.0,1,"This well-aged Cab offers savory and lovely aromas of salted Asian plum, light licorice, dried violets and lilacs, and expertly seasoned beef. The palate retains a tense, chewy structure and juicy acidity that frames flavors of dried blueberry, rose hips and more plum."
Fidelitas,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.82,64.09,11,"Most of these grapes go into Antiquum Farm's estate wines, but Harper Voit has smartly snagged enough for a few barrels. Generous tannins frame ripe red and blue fruits, with streaks of artisanal chocolate and sea salt caramel. Zingy spices contribute to a complex, lingering finish. All the Harper Voit 2014 Pinots are built for immediate pleasure, so no need to wait."
Fidelitas,Merlot,89.6,49.0,5,"An appealing wine for all types of Chardonnay palates, this bottling shows Meyer lemon zest, sea salt, tangerine pith, savory saffron and a touch of light butter on the nose. A salty lemon-curd flavor combo kicks off the palate, followed by honeysuckle and buttercream, proving rich yet dissected by smart acidity."
Fidelitas,Red Blend,91.0,50.0,1,"From select barrels, this “no name” reserve takes the signature elements of the winery's Pinots—notably forward, plush berry fruits and a strong whiff of tobacco—and punches them up to the next level. Big, solid, almost chunky with packed flavor, it touches lightly on lifted aromatics, and frames its tannins in dark chocolate."
Fidelitas,White Blend,91.0,32.0,1,"Dense, intense, concentrated and young, this wine is one for the cellar. It has tight aromas of cranberry, dried cherry and cardamom, while flavors offer ripe fruit character and a firm texture of fine-grained tannins. It should gain more complexity and smoothness after 2022."
Fidelity,Zinfandel,91.0,16.0,1,"In this opulent, layered and full-bodied wine, a smoky beefy aroma and a melt-in-the-mouth texture come with flavors of dark maraschino cherries, dark chocolate and baking spices. It's very mouth filling and mouth coating as well as firmly tannic, but the richness of the flavors helps it to drink very smoothly."
Field Stone,Petite Sirah,87.0,20.0,1,"This bottling, which is balanced by 16% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, rides the savory edge of the grape, with aromas of underbrush and dried herbs giving depth to the black-olive and black-currant aromas. The palate offers a mix of red and darker fruits, including cranberry, plum and blackberry, with touches of thyme and anise."
Field Stone,Red Blend,82.0,15.0,1,"Very fresh although not particularly fruity aromas of raspberry mesh with allspice, thyme and tarragon on the nose of this block-designate bottling from the historic vineyard. Energetic and lighter red-fruit flavors like pomegranate show on the sip, where fennel is the dominant spice."
Field Stone,Syrah,90.0,25.0,1,"This estate-driven wine combines 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 6% Merlot. Made in a classical Old-World style, it offers chalky tannin around composted earth, blackberry and cassis. The texture is firm and grippy, with supportive acidity at its core."
Field Stone,Viognier,88.0,25.0,1,"This wine's aromas are a bit locked up at present, revealing plum, herb, clove and barrel spice notes as it opens. The palate is dense and rich, full of dark fruit flavors and generous barrel accents. It pulls no punches."
Fielding Hills,Cabernet Franc,90.29,31.71,7,"This wine is a blend of all six Bordeaux varieties: 35% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc, 4% Carménère, 3% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot. Its coffee, cranberry, herb, currant, barrel spice and anise aromas lead to tightly wound, layered red and black fruit flavors. Plump, silky tannins provide the frame."
Fielding Hills,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.2,42.8,5,"This blend of 47% Grenache, 35% Mourvèdre and 18% Syrah is reminiscent of a walk through the dewy sagebrush, with dried wild herbs most prominent alongside cola, rustic plum and mulberry and a hint of pine forest. Those forest-like flavors show on the sip as well, with bay leaf, green peppercorn and a savory salts enhancing the baked berry and tangy plum skin elements—a GSM with teeth and structure."
Fielding Hills,Malbec,91.0,36.0,2,"Full and piquant aromas of black fruit, purple flowers, asphalt and pepper make for a rich and flowery nose on this bottling. Concentrated flavors of black currant and black plum ride a relatively light and airy body all the way into a grippy tannin-laced finish."
Fielding Hills,Merlot,90.4,36.8,5,"For those wondering what minerality means in a red wine, this bottling is the answer. Against the black cherry and dark strawberry on the nose rise powerful crushed slate and smashed graphite aromas. The palate starts with cranberry and pomegranate, but the slate and rocky-soil flavors swing back in, giving backbone to the hints of bay leaf and herbs."
Fielding Hills,Red Blend,89.88,33.0,8,"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. It's subtle on the nose, with currant, flower, crushed rock and herb notes. The palate is firmly structured, punctuating the flavors on the finish. Best 2025–2030."
Fielding Hills,Rosé,88.0,24.0,2,"A compelling spicy aroma and richly layered fruit give a lot of appeal to this full-bodied, fully tannic and nicely sculpted wine. It has a deep dark color, captivating oak and white-pepper aromas and a rich generous mouthfeel accompanied by an appropriately high level of fine-grained tannin. Best after 2020."
Fielding Hills,Syrah,90.75,39.5,8,"Aromas of vanilla-flecked and butter-laced pastry filled with cassis sauce show on the nose of this rich blend of 62% Syrah and 38% Mourvèdre from the Bien Nacido and Jada vineyards. The sip is very well structured by upright sticky tannins, which hold up flavors of crushed gravel and slate and a piquant boysenberry jam."
Fields,Cinsault,91.0,26.0,1,"Barrel notes of toast, butterscotch and spice are at the fore along with melted butter and peach on this 100% Canyon Vineyard Ranch wine. It's full bodied with a rich, creamy feel, wanting a bit more concentration and acidity to keep it together."
Fields Family,Red Blend,90.0,25.0,1,"Despite coming from a warm vintage, this appealing, well-priced wine has plenty of acid to go with its sleek yet ripe fruit. The fresh herb and cherry aromas and flavors distinctly announce it as Cabernet, with smoke on the finish."
Fields Family,Shiraz,89.0,42.0,1,"Steely on the nose, this Amy Butler bottling shows lemon blossoms, dried apples, ripe pear, lime juice and a touch of peach. The palate is high-toned and tight with citrus zest and lemon-verbena notes, dancing across the tongue on acidic tippy toes."
Fields Family,Syrah,88.75,22.0,4,"Light aromas of vanilla, coconut, exotic spices and blue fruit are followed by plump, tart fruit flavors and firm, somewhat astringent tannins. There are a lot of good things going on but the tannins need to be tamed."
Fields Family,Zinfandel,91.0,28.17,6,"The aromas of cigar box, lemon peel, woodspice and green herbs are distinctive. The palate brings tart, spritely acids, sultry fruit flavors and firm, somewhat blocky tannins. It needs to be on a dinner table to show its best."
Fifi,Sangiovese,90.0,24.0,1,"Hailing from one of the state's premier Syrah sites, this wine leads with aromas of berry, coffee, chicory and violets. The flavors are supple, backed by lightly grainy tannins."
Figge,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,35.0,1,"Dark, with a complex nose mixing very ripe, raisiny fruit with smoke and a hint of spoilage. The wine seems pushed just over the edge, losing focus and definition. The fruit quickly gives way to leaf and forest floor flavors in an herbal, earthy finish."
Figgins,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.67,85.0,6,"This is a fine budget bottle, with an aromatic mix of tart berry and pine needle. A streak of chocolate surrounds a supple, smooth wine that carries its tangy fruit through a satisfying finish, with just a suggestion of tanned leather."
Figgins,Riesling,90.33,30.0,3,"Hailing from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine offers reserved aromas of violets and raspberries along with whiffs of smoked meat and green herbs. The layered flavors are elegant yet intense, with vibrant acidity and a finish with plenty of hang time. The pleasure is as much about feel as flavor."
Finn Hill,Cabernet Franc,88.0,35.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon (81%) takes the lead on this wine with the rest Merlot. Intriguing aromas of dried herb, moist earth, funk and blackberry reveal a palate full of concentrated fruit and savory flavors. It shows a sense of freshness and finesse."
Finn Hill,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,35.0,2,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (45%), Merlot (45%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. The aromas—both perfumed and subtle—pop with notes of flowers, cassis bud, moist earth, funk, orange peel and red fruit. The flavors are concentrated and velvety, displaying a soft, compelling feel."
Finn Hill,Merlot,89.0,32.5,2,"One of the most compelling wines of its ilk, this big beauty has pure, focused and delicious fruit flavors, spicy and perfumed oak accents, and a very full body. The good mix of lively acidity and velvety tannins make it feel luxurious without smothering the taste buds."
Finn Hill,Petit Verdot,87.0,30.0,1,"A successful exploration of how Chardonnay can be both sharp with green fruit yet full in body, this bottling offers just-cut kiwi, crisp Asian and Anjou pear, lemon wedges and underripe mandarin on the chalky nose. A strong simmering acidity and intriguing texturality present flavors of lemongrass and green-apple flesh, with tangy lime pith in the background. Drink now while fresh."
Finn Hill,Riesling,87.67,18.67,3,"This blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre grown on the Chesebro family property indeed reflects the wild mountains, with aromas of black pepper, white pepper, lilac, wisteria, lavender oil, elderberry, cola and Dr Pepper on the lively nose. Root beer pops on the palate along with boysenberry, charcoal, tar and black pepper. It's vibrant and delicious."
Finn Hill,Rosé,87.0,18.0,1,"This is a funky briny wine that still seems a bit closed up on first pour. The palate is silky and focused, not having fully come together as of yet but still offering generous fruit, smoked meat and other savory flavors. It's all about elegance."
Finn Hill,Sangiovese,86.0,20.0,3,"The waves of aromas on this bottling are quite intriguing, starting with meat then moving to black olive and tobacco. It finally settles into dense rose petals, purple flowers, cinnamon, dark hibiscus and black plum. The sip focuses on minerality, with chipped slate showing first, then goes toward juniper and pine, all against a black raspberry and pomegranate backdrop."
Finn Hill,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,18.0,1,"Quite aromatic on first pour, this wine shows green peppercorn, violets, earth, smoked meat and savory aromas. The fruit and savory flavors are generous, showing length and depth."
Finn Hill,Syrah,88.0,35.0,2,"This impressively textured, focused and voluptuous wine offers well-defined flavors and aromas of honey, caramel and crisp Golden Delicious apple. Seamless and well balanced, it impresses from start to finish, with buoyant, supportive acidity at its core."
Firebrix,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,12.0,1,"Stunningly good, this hits you with waves of fruit, acidity and spice. It reverberates across, down and through the palate, recalling clover, citrus zest and grapefruit, all underlaid by bracing minerality."
Firebrix,Merlot,86.0,12.0,1,"Named after neighboring winery owner Mike Etzel (Beaux Frères), this exceptional wine is brilliantly focused and rippling with muscular depth. The palate is etched with blackberry and black cherry fruit, immersed in lush vanilla, coffee and caramel tones. It's instantly gratifying, impossibly seductive and exceptional in every way."
Firebrix,Red Blend,87.0,12.0,1,"The aromas explode with notes of potpourri, olive, smoked meat, fire pit, orange peel, mineral, mushroom, garrigue and white pepper. The palate is lifted, bright but intensely flavored, loaded with flower, berry, olive and charcuterie flavors. The finish seems near endless and the sense of balance is exquisite. It's shockingly good."
Firesteed,Chardonnay,87.0,35.0,1,"From Draper clone vines planted in 1965, this bright gold-hued wine brings myriad details to its apple, jicama, white peach and nut oil flavors. A whiff of smoke carries throughout, and its sheer complexity strains the vocabulary. Stay with it as more subtle layers unfold. Though seductive now, it should mature well through 2030."
Firesteed,Pinot Noir,86.0,75.0,1,"For fans of the variety, this is a consistently blockbuster wine, well made and remarkably fruity and floral. Violet aromas ride quietly over rounded flavors of cherry pie as the body takes on full-figured dimension. Richly voluptuous, there's balance here within the firm robust tannin structure and heady licorice-laden end."
Firesteed,Rosé,88.0,16.0,1,"Dark in color, this rosé made from Grenache grapes is quite sour and a little off-balance, though the bottle it comes in is very pretty."
Firestone,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.75,48.5,4,"This is a juicy, perfect melding of citrus and light tropical fruit flavors. With impeccable balance and poise, this thrilling, entirely stainless-steel-fermented Viognier persists well onto the graceful finish."
Firestone,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,41.5,4,"Smooth and textured, this is a supple, lightly earthy and aromatic Bordeaux-style blend. The principal components are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with smaller amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot. One gets the feeling that the winery was still finding its way during production; this was made by a winemaker no longer at Corliss. Berry, plum, fig, dried herb and cedar are all in the mix—it's more genteel than generous."
Firestone,Chardonnay,86.0,27.0,1,"Thoroughly delicious, this clever blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Viognier and Marsanne is a joyride of green and yellow fruit, citrus and pear, honeydew melon and sweet orange peel. It's complex and distinctive."
Firestone,Merlot,86.0,40.0,2,"This is a three-grape Bordeaux-style blend that is three-fifths Cabernet Sauvignon and one-fifth each Merlot and Petit Verdot. It has tremendous flavor appeal, featuring a lush mix of red and black fruit—both berry and plum—with generous barrel flavors of mocha and espresso. It gains mass and breadth as it breathes."
Firestone,Pinot Noir,85.0,35.0,1,"Bésoleil gains complexity with each new vintage. Grenache makes up the bulk of the blend, plus 18% Mourvèdre, 11% Cinsault and 6% Syrah. Deliciously spicy with cranberry, raspberry and other red fruit flavors, this tightly wound wine will reward decanting. The minerality and supple tannins suggest that it may be cellared as well."
Firestone,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,20.0,2,"This is wonderfully aromatic and forward, with lush fruit-pie flavors of blackberry and black cherry. There are graceful notes sprinkled generously throughout, hinting at peppery herb and anise. At once smooth and supple, long and generous, this is drinking exceptionally well."
Firestone,Syrah,90.75,32.5,4,"Monolith is a Bordeaux-style blend—mostly Cabernet Sauvignon—that's dark, smooth and smoky. Citrus scents adorn the deep fruit, which resolves in earthy, substantial tannins. The wine spent 22 months in 100% new French oak, yet the barrel notes seem muted, and the intense fruit is certainly up to the challenge."
Five Rows,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,14.0,1,"Big for a Riesling, this has concentrated, sappy, rich tropical-fruit flavors. The grapes used were sourced from the Lawrence Vineyard on the Royal Slope. It has a fair amount of residual sugar, adding extra richness. Succulent peach, apricot and papaya notes sends lip-licking flavors deep into the finish."
Five Rows,Chardonnay,86.5,13.5,2,"This introduces itself with sweet scents of plum and cherry, the sort found in young vines. It moves into a thick, well-structured midpalate, with big splashes of coffee, earth and roasted nut."
Five Star Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,48.0,1,"Vanilla and green wood aromas are at the fore, followed by cherry and herbs. The fruit flavors are sweet and elegant, with the oak nearly completely overriding them."
Flanagan,Chardonnay,94.0,62.0,1,"Lighter in color, this Syrah (83%)-dominated blend shows aromas of dehydrated blueberries, milk chocolate, black olive and plum. The blue fruit flavors are lightly sweet, with some residual sugar holding it together."
Fleming Jenkins,Syrah,90.0,40.0,1,"Syrupy and dense, this is a burly wine, soft but powerful, that keeps coming back to the theme of blackberry syrup. Velvety tannins buoy the midpoint, before it finishes in a burst of intense ripeness."
Fleur de California,Rosé,87.0,16.0,1,"Light in color and medium bodied, this unusual wine presents a weightiness, a throwback to California's earlier days of more widespread plantings of Gamay. This one offers a thick, syrupy overtone of blueberry and cherry, soft on the midpalate with nominal structure."
Flinch,Zinfandel,90.0,38.0,1,"Lavender, potpourri, cranberry-orange juice, Sichuan peppercorn, graphite and cinnamon hit the nose on this bottling from winemaker Aaron Walker. The complex, ever-evolving palate blends pomegranate and citrus rinds with black slate, peppercorns, dried oregano, thyme and rosemary."
Flora Springs,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,80.0,1,"Wound tightly, this burly, brawny bruiser comes out of its shell slowly to reveal soft, perfumy notes of violet and blueberry. Flavors of dark chocolate and jam sit atop powerfully rich, dense pockets of leather and black pepper. Drink now through 2023."
Flora Springs,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.08,126.92,13,"This wine's distinct and intriguing nose pairs cola and cinnamon with cranberry, chopped chaparral scrub and wildfire smoke. That scrubby character of green sage and mugwort extends to the palate, spicing up the beet juice, ripe raspberries and a pencil-lead backbone."
Flora Springs,Chardonnay,88.0,35.0,3,"This is a pretty wine, vibrant in white pepper and braised meat. The nose is pure violet and blueberry, while the approach to the fruit is light-handed, with integrated tannins and a low oak imprint. Entirely varietal, it delves into earthy territory with elements of forest floor and dark chocolate."
Flora Springs,Merlot,92.0,85.0,1,"Crisp undercurrents of tangerine, grapefruit and cranberry provide a brightness and light to this wine, which is velvety-smooth on the palate. An inaugural release for the producer from this vineyard, it bristles with cinnamon and clove, delving into black pepper spiciness as well. Drink this structured wine now through 2023."
Flora Springs,Red Blend,92.0,56.0,3,"A skyscraper-sized blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Syrah, 9% Cabernet Franc and 4% Malbec, this is a generously structured, tannic and bold expression of plum, leather and pencil lead that leans into gamy, black pepper notes as well. Velvety smooth, it has years to go in the bottle. Cellar through 2025."
Flora Springs,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,50.0,1,"A Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant mixture with 11% Cabernet Franc, 3% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, this powerfully generous wine has a thread of classic black olive and dried herb that provides a restrained edge. Tightly woven tannin and oak give added strength and structure."
Flowers,Chardonnay,93.0,85.0,2,"From the 1,400-elevation Van der Kamp Vineyard, this wine conveys roses and black tea, along with a woodsy, truffle-like character. While powerfully round and soft, it offers elegance in abundance, alongside a swatch of fresh-dug earth and a thick finish of forest floor. Drink now through 2022."
Flowers,Pinot Noir,91.29,72.14,7,"Flinty lemon and caramel are flouted around rich layers of caramel and baked quince in this blend of two vineyard sites, both planted to Wente selection Chardonnay. The richness of the vineyards speaks loudly enough to call for only neutral oak to be used in aging. The finish brings a spark of pineapple and mango custard."
FlyWine,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,13.0,2,"An oily character of tangerine skin, peach flesh and condensed nuts meets with caramel, pinched soda and cut stone-fruit freshness on the nose of this top bottling from the Los Gatos producer. The palate shows ripe Granny Smith apple flesh, seared pears and almond oil, with a sea-salt splash on the finish."
FlyWine,Chardonnay,86.0,10.0,1,"The fantastic nose pitches French toast together with Meyer lemon pith, crushed rock, struck match and a slight sour-cream element. This wine is immediately lively on the tongue, with lots of but not overdone acidity. Yeasty toast flavors are cut by lemon and poached pear on a racy and focused palate."
FlyWine,Pinot Gris,87.0,32.0,1,"This wine from a cool corner of the Sierra Foothills has lots of varietal character, from a rather deep straw color to waxy, nutty aromas to mild walnut and pear flavors to a rich, viscous texture. It is appetizing and substantial enough for a bold seafood dish."
FlyWine,Red Blend,86.0,10.0,1,"Quite tropical on the extremely dense nose, with guava nectar and honey aromas, this late-harvest wine is extremely sweet and treacly on the palate, without showing much complexity. It's like drinking liquid sugar."
Flying Dreams,Tempranillo,89.0,45.0,1,"Quite a different style from last year's 15% alcohol version, this seems raw, slightly bitter, and hints at garlic in the nose. Black cherries, cola and earth are in the mix, but something is not quite settled."
Flying Goat Cellars,Pinot Gris,91.0,22.0,1,"A helping of Petit Verdot adds to the strength and power of this gigantic, full-bodied wine, which shows elements of waxy plum, dried herb and even a touch of bell pepper on the palate, not quite resolved."
Flying Goat Cellars,Pinot Noir,92.91,46.95,22,"Rich, thick and robust, this offers a mélange of black cherry and strawberry. A fruity element dominates over any savory varietal character."
Flying Trout,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.5,32.0,2,"Dry, elegant and nicely reserved, this light-bodied wine is refreshing and intriguing. Subtlety works its magic in the bosc pear aromas and white peach flavors, and the crisp texture whets the appetite."
Flying Trout,Malbec,89.25,39.25,4,"Buttery vanilla, cherry and plum notes give this wine a plush backdrop of fruit and rich, round texture. With small percentages of Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, it reveals additional cedar and graphite components before unleashing a lasting chocolate flavor on the finish."
Flying Trout,Red Blend,89.25,30.75,4,"Crisply fruity, this shows some carbonic brightness, pushing cranberry and raspberry fruit ahead of lighter flavors of cherry Popsicle. It's a lightweight, yet delightful, summertime red."
Flywheel,Chardonnay,91.0,38.0,1,"Flavors roll from cranberry to sweet red cherry in a red-fruit riot. It was aged in 52% new and 24% one-year-old oak, but it's unobtrusive and not especially toasty. The barrel time has begun to smooth out any bumps and rough edges, though a touch of phenolic bite remains. Drink from 2018 to 2022."
Flywheel,Grenache,88.0,28.0,1,"Plump black raspberry and blackberry notes mix with vanilla and baked licorice on the fruit-driven nose of this blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Syrah. The tannic tension and strong acidity of the palate overwhelms the flavors at first, eventually revealing dark purple fruit and a vanilla-laced finish."
Flywheel,Mourvèdre,92.0,28.0,1,"Made in a full-bodied and fleshy style, this comes from an estate vineyard long owned by the producer. Cloudy, with a distinct fresh cherry aroma, it opens with leathery tannins and pronounced oak notes before its bright, citrus-like acidity settles in."
Flywheel,Pinot Noir,91.0,38.0,1,"This opens with juicy cranberry and cherry fruit, remaining concentrated through the core palate. Good as it is, the wine fades more quickly than its reserve siblings, which would suggest drinking this one first while the others gain further time in bottle."
Fog Crest,Chardonnay,92.0,39.0,3,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot with a bit of Norman Beko's estate Syrah shows concentrated blueberry, tobacco, dried dill, leather and sweet cedar aromas on the nose, in accordance with its age. There are elegant purple flower, caramelized fruit and mocha spice flavors on the palate, which is holding up well but should be enjoyed now."
Fog Crest,Pinot Noir,90.5,47.0,4,"This creamy, lush wine expresses orange and tangerine fruit mostly, with slight cherry and strawberry accents. High-toned acidity lifts the riper, plush mouthfeel."
Fogline Vineyards,Chardonnay,85.0,38.0,1,"From a replanted block of the vineyard, this wine is zesty, savory and high in acidity. With a backbone of stony texture and a deep core of licorice and strawberry flavors, it's bold in tannins and intensity, yet finishes bright."
Fogline Vineyards,Pinot Noir,88.33,48.33,3,"Earth and black tea meet forest floor notes in this dark, brooding and powerfully full-bodied wine. A touch of reduction accentuates the profuse oak, recalling clove and cardamom, as tingling acidity vies for attention and integration."
Fogline Vineyards,Zinfandel,90.0,35.0,1,"Another fine example of Bechthold's dry-farmed, old, gnarled-vine beauty in a glass, this wine is light in color and high-toned in cherry and rhubarb fruit. Buoyed by acidity, the finish offers just a light seasoning of pepper."
Foley,Chardonnay,90.77,42.5,22,"A forward, softly fruity wine closer to California Pinot than most Oregon examples. The vintage contributes lush fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry, while aging in 20% new French oak brings a layer of smooth milk chocolate."
Foley,Pinot Noir,90.07,54.29,14,"Restrained and tannic, this Zin needs time to resolve and mellow its fine layers of blackberry and tar. Complex and structured, from 95-year-old vines, it should do that with aplomb, the wine more savory than sweet, a refreshing alternative to super-sized Zins."
Foley Johnson,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,75.0,2,"The 2009 Syrah, like its companion reds, needs plenty of breathing time to shed its hard shell of tannins and barrel flavors. Coffee and smoke are the aromas and flavors first noticed. Slowly the fruit emerges, offering pretty boysenberry that has a tangy snap."
Folie à Deux,Chardonnay,85.0,18.0,1,"The fruit is forward and tart, mixing berries, cherries and plums; and the tannins almost disappear in a pillowy cloud. Up front this is a delicious wine, that seems to disappear in the middle and then return for a spicy flourish in the finish, marred a bit by a dominating chalkiness and a hint of dill."
Folie à Deux,Zinfandel,88.5,33.0,2,"This budget-priced Syrah is lean and peppery, with plenty of color and tannin. There are simple flavors of red currants, supported with lightly earthy tannins and proportionate acids."
Folin Cellars,G-S-M,88.0,34.0,1,"Clean, crisp and dry, this gentle rosé has a light and pretty strawberry candy color and the flavors follow right along, with a citrusy snap in the acids."
Folin Cellars,Grenache,89.5,34.5,2,An unusual tawny color blends with deep pink in this wine that conveys cinnamon aromas and persimmon flavors. It's certainly an unusual style but has its own appeal.
Folin Cellars,Red Blend,86.5,26.0,2,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (60%), Merlot (15%), Syrah (15%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of smoke, herbs, cedar and mushroom show some volatility. The cranberry and cherry flavors are light and elegant."
Folin Cellars,Syrah,89.0,32.0,1,"An earthy, funky block-designated wine, this tastes thin despite its fuller-bodied alcohol level. A plethora of fresh-picked herb and forest characterizes this effort, which finishes in thick tannin."
Folin Cellars,Tempranillo,87.67,30.67,3,"A bit shy on the nose, this eventually shows red currants and sour plum-skin aromas. The palate is also reluctant at first, with purple fruit and black-pepper flavors."
Folin Cellars,Viognier,87.25,26.0,4,"Young, sharp, and spicy, with underlying layers of peach, apricot, Meyer lemon, butter and caramel. This clearly needs a lot more cellar time to reach its full potential, but it is already a lovely wine to sip at meal's end."
Foppiano,Chardonnay,88.4,29.8,5,"Nondescript in aroma, this soft Cabernet Franc offers pronounced tannins and a taste of red currant."
Foppiano,Petite Sirah,87.67,25.0,3,"A 100% varietal wine from near the town of Glen Ellen, this is a healthy marriage of power and grace. The wine is fiery in leathery tannin and full-bodied blackberry ripeness laced in cinnamon and black pepper. Aged in new French oak, it's structured and age-worthy, though quite enjoyable now."
Foppiano,Pinot Noir,86.0,38.33,3,"This is a relatively light-bodied and elegant version of the variety, softly approachable and enjoyable even in its youth. Leathery pepper sits atop nuanced layers of chocolate and blueberry, with a tang of sour cherry and a leanness to the finish."
Foppiano,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,15.0,2,"Rusty rose in color, this Southern California stab at Sherry is quite rewarding, showing caramelized pecans and almonds, light tobacco leaf and a touch of iodine on the extremely nutty nose. Light peat and walnut flavors show on the sip, as does sour marzipan and burnt orange peel, with a roasted-almond-laced finish."
Foppiano,Zinfandel,86.0,35.0,2,"Coming from an up-and-coming region of the valley, this wine is direct in its appeal, with opulent aromas of dark plum, grape gummy, peppery spices and an herbal top note. The flavors are broad and pure, showing a deft touch. Coffee flavors linger on the finish."
For a Song,Chardonnay,85.0,10.0,1,"Very tight yellow-pear-skin aromas meet with lemon rinds, scratched lime skin, fragrant wet clay and very pithy aromas on this intriguing bottling. Once sipped, the body is steely in acidity and texture, like licking gunmetal, with a warmer stone-fruit element arising in the midpalate. It's a very interesting wine that will appeal to savvy palates."
For a Song,Petit Verdot,85.0,20.0,1,"This vibrant, full-bodied wine combines truly vibrant fruit flavors like black cherry and black grapes with a broad and juicy texture. It delivers a sense of layering of fruit flavors on the palate and a lingering, ripe finish."
For a Song,Red Blend,84.0,15.0,1,"From a newer vineyard located up Gypsy Canyon off of Highway 246, this wine shows light apple aromas along with lemon blossoms. Ripe yellow pears and apples show through a stony tightness that frames the midpalate, offering a Key-lime pith element and good saline quality."
For a Song,Riesling,89.0,10.5,2,"This is an appropriately dark and leathery wine, saddle-like in aroma, with firm traces of black pepper. Blueberry tart and violet provide further complexity and invitation."
Force Majeure,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.75,65.75,4,"Fuzzy peach with a companionable co-host of Meyer lemon star in this medium-bodied, voluptuously appealing wine. It's balanced and easy to enjoy, its finish taking on added volume and likability."
Force Majeure,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.14,72.86,7,"Dark gold in color, this wine opens in decadent caramel and toffee and retains a slight thickness on the palate. Yet it's quite restrained and balanced in the end, showing an elegance of lemon crispness on the finish, and a focused bite of apple."
Force Majeure,G-S-M,93.0,58.0,1,"This is a dry, tannic estate wine that's rich and ripe with a leathery aspect of gun smoke and blackberry. It shows more in the way of black fruit and spicy pepper than fruit that's delicate or crisp."
Force Majeure,Grenache,92.0,55.0,1,"Dark pink in the glass, this bubbly is incredibly foamy throughout the experience. It begins with aromas of strawberry, raspberry, plum and red apple, then explodes with bubbles on the palate, which make it hard to find the sour pomegranate and plum-skin flavors that eventually emerge."
Force Majeure,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.33,52.5,6,"Lushly scented with fresh-cut wood, red berries, cherries and toasted coconut, this delicately entwines the flavors that follow. It's a gentle, lovely, graceful and low-alcohol beauty that should continue to drink well into the mid-2020's."
Force Majeure,Syrah,91.5,61.6,10,"Dense and intense, with loads of fine-grained tannin, this is a deep, dark-colored wine with oodles of flavor and a very thick texture. As massive as it is in texture though, delicious flavors like blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate come through and then linger on the finish. Drink from 2016 to 2026."
Force Majeure,Viognier,90.0,35.0,1,"This big-boy, 100% varietal Cab is reflective of both its vintage and provenance, a celebration of black pepper, blackberry and tar around an intensely full-bodied, bittersweet palate. Tobacco leaf and leather saddle interweave themselves through the wine's middle and end. Drink now through 2020."
Force of Nature,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,23.0,1,"This is a rich, inviting wine with characteristics of dried cranberry and red currant, replete with dusty, spicy tannins and spicy, spiked vanilla. Lush, the tannins are soft and supple, a tad smoky, and the secondary elements darker in smoke, black licorice and espresso. Burly, it's balanced and refined."
Force of Nature,Chardonnay,91.0,23.0,1,"Adam Comartin's San Jose-based label shines a bright light on this new appellation. This wine shows blackberry shave ice, black cherries, black pepper, cola and the lifting aromatics of violets on the nose. More black pepper spices up the palate, with the balanced cherry and berry power proving quite distinctive and regal."
Forchini,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,36.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up the majority of this Meritage, with 25% Merlot, 8% Malbec, 8% Petit Verdot and 3% Cabernet Franc. The blending succeeds in offering a mix of chalky tannins and juicy cassis, with the wine structured and fairly elegant in style. Pencil lead and licorice mark the lengthy finish. Drink now through 2020."
Forchini,Pinot Noir,87.0,36.0,1,"This wine comes from a single vineyard in the western part of the appellation. Aromas suggest honeysuckle, lemon cream sauce and a wild array of garden herbs and spices, from scallions and green garlic to fresh oregano. It's light and bright on the palate, with a steely focus of lime juice on peach."
Forchini,Zinfandel,85.0,30.0,1,"Concentrated violets, cherry blossoms and cola aromas show on this wine by master sommelier Paolo Barbieri (who works in the cellar of friend Joey Tensley) that gets 5% Viognier added to the mix. Flavors are dense and broadly approachable, with blackberries, black cherries and purple flower elements."
Forefathers,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,50.0,2,"This blend of grapes from four vineyards—48% Alamo Creek, 18% Bien Nacido, 18% Spanish Springs and 16% Ventana—offers dense berries and smoke on the nose as well as black pepper and tar. The tar shows strongly on the palate, as do blackberry blossoms and denser black pepper spice."
Forgeron,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,65.0,1,"From a warm site in the heart of St. Helena's valley floor, this is a restrained, elegant version of a powerfully built wine, thick in tannin and yet nonetheless able to speak its mind. Mushroom aromas give it a Pinot Noir-esque personality at first, before layers of red and black berry provide sultry, juicy texture and flavor. The finish is chewy, asking for more time. Cellar through 2023."
Forgeron,Merlot,91.5,38.0,2,"From an area better known for red wines, this bottling by Paso Robles-based Jeremy Weintraub shows the strong white wine potential of this new Santa Barbara County appellation. Aromas of peach, cherimoya and white truffle cream lead into a waxy, restrained palate that shows golden flesh fruit, beeswax, a bit of yogurt and a minerally snap."
Forgeron,Primitivo,87.0,30.0,1,"Spicy, fruity and fresh, this hearty vineyard-designate is high-toned in red cherry and citrus, well-integrated and softly layered, with a blistering note of tannic power on the finish. Drink now through 2020."
Forgeron,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,35.0,1,"Lush and fruit forward, Rapture, whose motto is “Don't be left behind!” is full bodied but soft, with leather and herb tones and a smoky finish. Blended with a smidgen of Petite Sirah and reaching 14.9% abv, it tastes every bit of that, with a smoky finish of oak."
Forgeron,Rhône-style White Blend,89.8,25.0,5,"Grassy aromatically, this is a crisp, refreshing white that's slightly undefined in pear and melon. Light bodied and easy to quaff."
Forgeron,Syrah,90.67,35.33,3,"Big tannins dominate this dry, brushy expression of Cabernet Sauvignon with 5% Merlot that is austere in fruit."
Foris,Cabernet Franc,87.0,20.0,1,"Ripe tomato, prune and herb flavors come with some sweetness and a soft, full texture. Still, it has enough tannin and acidity to keep it lively on the finish."
Foris,Gewürztraminer,90.12,14.25,8,"From one of the Benziger family's coolest-climate vineyards, and one that is Demeter-certified Biodynamic, there's a richness of cherry amid subtle aromatics of rose and cinnamon spice. A delicate wine that's light in texture, it offers earthiness and a long, balanced finish."
Foris,Muscat,88.0,14.0,1,"Well structured, it places its raspberry fruit in a compact, focused core. An appealing and balanced mix of herb, baking spices, citrus and white pepper highlights give the wine complexity beyond its apparent lightness. Drink now–2019."
Foris,Pinot Blanc,88.0,14.0,1,"Principally Malbec, with 18% Tempranillo filling out the blend, this tangy and appealing wine wraps its red currant fruit in streaks of vanilla, tobacco and light herbs."
Foris,Pinot Gris,86.0,14.0,1,"This was pressed whole-cluster and fermented in French oak, roughly one-third new. It's a flavorful wine with caramel apple appeal, good definition and medium length. The barrels put a pleasing toasty frame around the finish."
Foris,Pinot Noir,88.0,33.0,5,"There is a vividly refreshing nose to this biodynamic wine, full of aromatic lift from brisk stone fruit and white rock minerality. It's full on the mouth, nicely balanced with no edges sticking out at all, and just a tad of tart apple on the finish."
Foris,Red Blend,85.0,14.0,1,"Tropical ripeness shows strong on the nose of this wine, which is made from the Musque clone out of the Carter Estate Vineyard. It shows aromas of Juicy Fruit gum, papaya-orange-guava juice and daffodils. The palate offers a honeyed red-apple flavor."
Foris,Riesling,85.0,14.0,2,"Light and pleasant, this offers some punchy phenolics but rather limpid fruit. It spent eight months in one-third new French oak."
Formation,Pinot Noir,89.0,15.0,1,"The nose is slow to emerge on this proprietary blend, with some berries, toasted cedar and hibiscus extract eventually arising. The palate blends smoked meats with blackberry juice, blueberries and a pine-like woodiness."
Fort Ross,Chardonnay,92.67,49.33,3,"A vanilla bean element leads the nose on this wine, with cherry, olallieberry and caramel syrup coming in as well. The palate isn't quite so delicious, with the vanilla flavors remaining alongside woody elements, purple fruits and black olives."
Fort Ross,Pinot Noir,92.17,55.0,6,"Despite the famed vineyard on the label, this seems a bit gauzy, chalky and stripped. There are light suggestions of berry and cherry, and hints of the nice details of earth and mineral that old vines can often bring. The finish is dilute and slightly metallic."
Fort Ross Vineyard,Pinot Noir,92.0,65.0,1,"Lightly fruity, this all-Pinot Noir rosé just hints at strawberry, but seems overloaded with flavors and scents of pastry crust and vanilla cookie."
Fortress,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,40.0,2,"Boldly flavored and slightly sweet, this blend of mostly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon smells jammy, tastes ripe and juicy and has a fairly smooth texture with a touch of tannin. The flavors resemble black berry and sweet red cherry, the body is full and the finish is fruity."
Foundry,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,82.0,1,"Much like the winery's Pinot Gris, this estate-grown Pinot Blanc is built around mineral-infused fruit that is immaculately clean and vividly refreshing. Tart and juicy, with Asian pear, green apple, and lemon/lime acidity."
Foundry,Chardonnay,93.0,42.0,1,"Nicely balanced and detailed, this Malbec includes small amounts of Cab Franc and Syrah. Tangy raspberry and spicy strawberry jam fruit flavors are dusted with toast and cracker notes. The wine spent 18 months in half new, half neutral oak barrels."
Foundry,Pinot Noir,88.0,48.0,1,"Absolutely huge fruit blows out of this bottle as soon as it's opened. A rush of gorgeous black cherry is buoyed by snappy acidity and generously finished with smoke and coffee accents from having aged in 50% new oak. Details of iron and baking spice emerge also, and the silky tannins glide through a lengthy and delightful finish. A blend of 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot."
Foundry,Red Blend,89.0,32.0,1,"This blend is 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 22% Merlot, using grapes sourced entirely from this iconic Red Mountain vineyard. Notes of spice and iron interplay with tightly wound berry and cassis fruit. This is a steely, muscular wine, with an underpinning of graphite. History has proven that it will age beautifully."
Foundry,Sparkling Blend,91.5,46.0,2,"This reserve-level Cabernet—made from grapes sourced partly from 35-year-old vines—is lovely in its wealth of detail. A brambly, elegant mouthful of berry and cherry flavors mingles with a note of rose petal. The finish is soaked in graphite, with length, grip and finesse."
Foundry Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,42.0,1,"This pure Syrah—the first reserve Syrah from Gorman—pulls out all the stops. It's a tannic, bold, earthy and powerful wine that's loaded with black fruits. Aged for 20 months in 100% new French oak, it takes the wood in stride, adding Red Mountain minerality to the mix."
Foundry Vineyards,Chardonnay,92.0,28.0,1,"Aged in French oak puncheons, this youthful, citrusy, big and smoky wine seems to flicker in and out—like an old movie—with each sip revealing a different view of the landscape. Herb, cacao, cassis and balsamic flavors intertwine. The lengthy finish is balanced and structured."
Foundry Vineyards,Red Blend,88.0,23.6,5,"Opulento is made entirely- with authentic Portuguese varieties, based on 60% Touriga Nacional. It's truly Port-like in flavor, showing deep notes of black cherry and cassis fruit. Smooth and supple, this is thoroughly delicious and should not be missed."
Fount,Rosé,86.0,18.0,1,"From a vineyard just 4.5 miles from the Pacific Ocean comes this inky wine, heady in aromas of freshly turned black dirt, sagebrush, menthol and boysenberry. On the palate, there is black pepper spice, dark chocolate and Earl Grey tea. Since it's so multi-layered and powerful, it needs some time to breathe before diving in. Decant for sure."
Four Lanterns,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,62.0,2,"Smoke and spice come through in this sensuous wine with pretty accents and flavors of rose petals, peaches and apricots. The mouthfeel is soft, even silky, and the length impressive."
Four Lanterns,Grenache-Syrah,90.0,48.0,1,"The wine features very pretty aromatics and a soft and elegant entry that is just on the edge of high-toned. The fruit is nicely ripened and the mouthfeel satiny, with a lick of mocha sliding across the finish."
Four Lanterns,Picpoul,93.0,28.0,1,"A softly layered, elegant estate wine, this slowly reveals shocks of cherry, vanilla and coconut. A tanginess to the tannins gives it an oomph of verve and freshness on the palate."
Four Lanterns,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,48.0,1,"High-toned red fruit wraps around jolts of black tea in this savory, structured and nicely made vineyard-designate, a full-bodied, burly wine. Drinking well upon opening, it develops nuance and character in the glass as it goes along."
Four Lanterns,Rosé,87.0,28.0,1,"This estate wine melds luxurious texture and ripeness with zesty, buoyant acidity, integrating the flavors with 100% neutral oak. Straightforward in its approach, it'll serve well at the table, offering soft, approachable character and a plethora of quality fruit."
Four Lanterns,Syrah,92.5,62.0,2,"This is a light, clear and moderately oaked vineyard-designate from a tremendous Westside Road site. Pomegranate, rhubarb and cherry-orange play on the palate in lithe, ethereal and elegant ways, remaining light bodied and refined throughout."
Four Lanterns,Viognier,89.5,28.0,2,Mouthfillingly juicy red fruit opens this well-crafted and impressive wine from a marquee location for the variety. Measured and welcome acidity balances the larger aspects of brambly black fruit and leathery cinnamon spice.
Four Sisters Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,26.0,1,The fragrant mix of flowers and fruit introduces a wine already moving into secondary fruit flavors. Strawberry and cherry components are softened with highlights of cola and caramel. There's a hint of orange creeping into the hue around the rim. Drink now through 2018.
Four Sisters Ranch,Malbec,85.0,27.0,1,"From a vineyard in Nipomo at the southern end of the county, this fresh bottling show strawberries, ripe lavender, exotic rose petals, cinnamon and lots of red-spice notes. The palate is peppy, with tangy cranberry and pomegranate fruit as well as deeper notes of sandalwood, flint and gravel."
Four Sisters Ranch,Merlot,89.0,25.0,2,"Opaque and thick in color, this bombastically powerful and concentrated wine has pruney sweetness lurking on the back palate, softened by sprinkles of vanilla and black pepper atop a sturdy helping of blackberry pie."
Four Sisters Ranch,Red Blend,86.0,27.67,3,"The aromas are somewhat light considering the variety and style, with notes of orange peel and flower. It drinks sweet, finishing with orange flavors. It's enjoyable but the concentration doesn't seem all there."
Four Sisters Ranch,Sparkling Blend,85.0,30.0,1,"Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up equal parts of this blend. Aromas are up front, with notes of baking spice, dates, anise and slightly dried-out fruit. Dark-cherry flavors bring a sense of concentration and enjoyment."
Four Sisters Ranch,Zinfandel,91.0,30.0,2,"Fresh-squeezed citrus marks the majority of this wine's profile on the palate, a lingering, lifted and accentuated expression of acidity that keeps it buzzing in freshness and a high tone of freshness, unfettered much by oak."
Four Vines,Zinfandel,88.6,18.4,5,"Waxy in mouthfeel and dark gold in color, this wine offers simple fresh lemon and green apple flavors, its finish expansive and full."
Fox Run,Chardonnay,85.0,15.0,2,"This wine—part of the “Seeds of Empowerment” fundraising series benefitting female do-gooders around the world—is light in the glass, crisp on the nose and laced with lime blossom, lemon peel, wet stone and Gala apple scents. Its shows bracing freshness on the palate through key lime, white peach and Asian pear flavors."
Fox Run,Riesling,86.0,16.0,1,"Soft, smoky oak permeates this full-bodied wine, with light clove and cinnamon accents. The rich layers of blackberry and black currant fruit are complemented by mocha notes."
Foxen,Chardonnay,91.5,35.0,6,"This is a rich-textured, full-bodied wine with lots of dark fruit flavors and thick tannins softened by a touch of sweetness. It has a very dark color, strawberry and blackberry aromas and darker, more concentrated flavors including dark chocolate and blueberry."
Foxen,Chenin Blanc,91.5,25.0,2,"On first pour, the aromas of toast, char, spice and herb show some reduction that blows off over time. The purple-fruit flavors are lighter in style, showing a pleasing sense of purity, with the concentration dipping in the middle before coming back together on the finish."
Foxen,Pinot Noir,93.22,61.44,27,"This wine is brooding, with aromas of dark cherry and game. The palate boasts bold fruit and savory flavors along with slightly bunched-up tannins."
Foxen,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.5,40.0,2,"Ripe fruit and plenty of astringent tannins give this a bold but unbending feel. Fans of really big reds will enjoy it now with a juicy steak or bacon cheeseburger, and time will tell if it mellows into a more approachable style."
Foxen,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,28.0,1,"Another attempt at a low-impact Chardonnay unfettered by oak, this result is curiously confectionary and sweet. Apple flavors veer into candy territory and the wine is slightly fat instead of crisp, despite the low alcohol and stainless-steel fermentation."
Foxen,Syrah,92.62,46.25,8,"This tastes straightforward and modestly fruity. Smooth in texture and not very tannic, it has just enough red cherry and plum flavor to be substantive. Made from 70% Zinfandel, 25% Sangiovese and 5% Syrah."
Foxen 7200,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,42.0,2,"A small percentage of Petit Verdot was added to this Cab, the grapes sourced from throughout the Napa Valley. Cedar, mint and chocolate cassis come foreward on the palate, the wine slightly thin though oaky."
Foxen 7200,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.67,49.67,6,"Sweetness, softness and a little carbonation make this drink more like a Moscato. It would make a good dessert wine or accompaniment to cheese, and will be especially good for your non wine-geek friends. Light in alcohol, too."
Foxen 7200,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,28.0,2,"With grapes sourced 60% from Sonoma County and 40% from Mendocino County, this is a soft, floral wine with a bright finish. A sister brand made by Martin Ray, it's priced affordably and will offer a pleasant experience for most palates."
Foyt Family,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,110.0,1,"A smoky, sharp aroma mingles with fruitiness. The wine tastes like raspberries and dried cranberries, and feels firm with tannins and acidity."
Franchere,Pinot Noir,88.67,32.0,3,"This red wine named simply Blend is – guess what! – a mix of Columbia valley grapes, including Syrah, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Zinfandel and Grenache. This is bigger and spicier than Sineann's other blend, called simple Red Table Wine, and shows more concentration. The acids and tannins are in a stand-off at the moment, but throw a steak into the mix and you'll have a party."
Francis Coppola,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,27.6,5,"Roughly half and half Viognier and Roussanne, this is vivid and fresh, with grapefruit flesh and rind in the flavor mix. Peach and apricot streaks slip into the midpalate, and the wine sets up bracing and clean, with just a hint of bitterness."
Francis Coppola,Chardonnay,88.4,28.2,5,"This focuses on the Wadensvil clone, and seems almost spritzy—it's definitely a tongue-tickler. Cherry cola flavors highlight sweet, primary fruit. Refreshing, though probably best enjoyed within the first couple of years."
Francis Coppola,Syrah,93.0,38.0,1,"The aromas of stone fruit, spice and toast show nuance and detail. The palate is restrained, showing a beautiful sense of balance to the elegant lemony flavors."
Francis Ford Coppola,Cabernet Franc,87.0,42.0,1,"A nice salmon color, this subtle kitchen-sink pink blend of 77% Grenache, 8% Mission, 4% Petite Sirah, 4% Syrah, 4% Zinfandel, 1% Cabernet Sauvignon, 1% Merlot and 1% Petit Verdot offers clove, raspberry and light plum on the nose. The palate offers more raspberry, a touch of bubblegum and a concrete-driven mineral tension that makes for excellent texture."
Francis Ford Coppola,Chardonnay,86.5,17.5,2,"Rich blackberry and chocolate flavors, rounded tannins, good concentration and a velvety mouthfeel add up to a lot of pleasure in this full-bodied wine blended from Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon."
Francis Ford Coppola,Petite Sirah,88.0,34.0,1,"This 100% varietal wine displays aromas of herb, leaf, cocoa, barrel spice and currant. The flavors are light and fresh, showing restraint and a pleasing mouthfeel. The finish lingers."
Francis Ford Coppola,Pinot Grigio,85.5,14.5,2,"Intriguing aromas of lime zest and warm butter are enhanced by slightly botanical aromas of cut chives, kiwi and more green fruit. The palate is laced with easy flavors of apple, sea salt, dried peach and lime rind."
Francis Ford Coppola,Pinot Noir,87.89,22.78,9,"Café au lait, mocha, wood spice and herb aromas are followed by sweet plentiful black fruit flavors. The tannins give a dry squeeze."
Francis Ford Coppola,Red Blend,86.5,31.5,2,"Bright olallieberrries, fresh lilacs and crushed graphite show on the rather boisterous nose of this bottling. The wine is quite soft upon the sip, starting a tad sweet and then gaining more serious notes of oregano, tarragon, mint and anise, all presented with strong acidity."
Francis Ford Coppola,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,16.0,3,"Sweeter aromas of citrus, chopped Gala apples and a little bit of melted butter make for a familiar nose on this well-priced bottling by Brian and Stephy Terrizzi. Clean flavors of white peach, lemon butter and ripe yellow pear make this bottling likeable for all types of Chardonnay fans."
Francis Ford Coppola,Sparkling Blend,87.0,19.0,1,"Herb, red-berry, vanilla and cherry aromas are followed by reserved black-cherry flavors. It shows a lot of restraint."
Francis Ford Coppola,Syrah,89.0,36.0,1,"Aromas of fresh, savory green herbs and red fruit lead to sumptuous black olive and red-fruit flavors. It shows a lot of elegance and grace, leaning hard into the savory."
Francis Tannahill,Gewürztraminer,87.0,25.0,1,"The two varieties show themselves in turn, with notes of fig complemented by herb, citrus and tropical fruit. The palate has tart, juicy grapefruit-like acidity and a stretched-out finish."
Francis Tannahill,Pinot Gris,92.0,45.0,1,"This has a great nose, with bright cherry and berry fruit. Berry, black cherry, coffee and earth components combine in a pleasing and muscular blend. The midpalate is broad and chewy, with plenty of liquorous highlights. Tannins are a bit drying and the finish shows some sharp alcoholic burn."
Francis Tannahill,Pinot Noir,90.33,50.33,3,"Rollat's Sophie occupies the entry-level rung on the ladder, behind the elegant and polished Rollat and the dense, compact and highly cellar-worthy Edouard. But Sophie is charming and accessible, a blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc that is elegant and bright. The fruit focus is on cranberry and raspberry, tart and well-defined, and the wine is immaculately clean. It's light and charming, but a perfect choice for autumnal foods."
Francis Tannahill,Red Blend,91.0,38.0,1,"Interesting to see that Washington State vineyards can ripen Sangio in a wide range of microclimates; this is true to the variety with tart acids, sharp flavors of berry, hints of pumpkin pie spice and tobacco, and just enough butterscotch barrel notes to fill in around the rough edges. This is good winemaking, with a tough grape."
Francis Tannahill,Rhône-style White Blend,91.0,28.0,1,"This is Pepper Bridge Merlot, and it beautifully expresses the vineyard trademarks: fresh fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, spread out broadly across the palate, and backed with tart acids and light tannins. There is a strong streak of Asian spicebox as well, but overall the wineis very approachable, which makes it is a Merlot to enjoy with rich fish, such as salmon. It's bright and lightly spicy and not too heavy."
Franciscan,Chardonnay,91.33,40.0,3,"Stiff, tannic, earthy and wrapped up tight. It's a big, bruiser of a wine, oaky, earthy and showing liquorous barrel flavors. Tasted three times over a four month period, it remains quite tight and hidden; the fruit is there but it's very difficult to get this wine to open up. In time, therating could significantly improve."
Franciscan,Meritage,89.0,53.33,3,"Rounded melon, grapefruit juice, lemon chiffon, gray slate and a bit of white pepper swirl into a distinctive nose on this wine by the San Luis Obispo-based producer. The palate is tight and bright, though a bit sour with apple-peel flavors."
Frank Family,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.5,150.0,2,"A curious mix of 77% Pinot Gris and 33% Chardonnay from a sought-after vineyard site, Buddy's is oaky, salty and thick, with a floral bouquet that lightens its load and represents the Pinot Gris component well. It may need more time to harmonize."
Frank Family,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.2,173.0,5,"An attractive oaky theme runs through this medium-bodied and appropriately tannic wine. It smells like toasted bread, cinnamon and vanilla, and tastes both fruity and full of oak spices."
Frank Family,Chardonnay,90.5,58.75,4,"This good varietal rosé has a little more body and a little more breadth in the mouthfeel than many others, along with mild strawberry and cherry flavors that give it substance."
Frank Family,Pinot Noir,90.0,65.0,3,"From several of the producer's estate vineyards, this wine traffics in spicy, leathery texture and robust full-bodied power, layering in more tart savory characteristics of rhubarb, dark cherry and orange. The tannins are firm and supportive, taking on a velvety sheen."
Frank Family,Sangiovese,87.0,65.0,1,"Dark, fresh and somewhat sour red-fruit aromas meet with cedar on the nose of this bottling. The palate is juicy with red plums and strawberries at first, then shows more of a pine-needle edge. The tannins are a bit chunky and chewy, though, but may smooth out with time."
Frank Family,Sparkling Blend,92.0,55.0,2,"Brooding raspberry, tobacco, herb, cedar and barrel spice aromas are followed by ripe cherry flavors in this wine. It's enjoyable but lacks precision."
Frank Family,Zinfandel,88.67,49.0,3,"Savory and tart, this is a dry, expressive white, varietal in nature, that offers tart tightly wound flavors of quince, white peach and lemon. A back note of freshly cut grass teases the nose and palate."
Freelander,Chardonnay,82.0,13.0,1,"This leads with herb, vanilla and plum aromas, along with a reduced note of tire rubber. On the palate, sweet plum flavors are backed by gritty tannins, proving somewhat disjointed."
Freeman,Chardonnay,93.0,45.0,1,"Polished aromas of roasted nuts, sea salt, Meyer lemon peel and onion skin show on the nose of this widely available bottling from the Chardonnay kings. The sip is a little bit flat in terms of texture and acidity, but there are compelling and satisfying flavors of roasted walnuts and pecans, with a citrusy acidity that rises toward the finish."
Freeman,Pinot Noir,93.2,60.8,10,"This wine's barrel spice, licorice, cranberry and cherry aromas are high toned. The palate is broad, with generous fruit flavors that taper toward the finish."
Freemark Abbey,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.25,143.75,4,"Released in the autumn of 2011 at nine years of age, the 2002 Citation, not surprisingly, has dried out. Fruit leather and earthy tannins are lightly streaked with citrus. Drink up."
Frei Brothers,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,27.0,3,"Still young and not entirely pulled together, this is still showing some post-fermentation flavors of candied orange, with a somewhat grainy texture. It's off-dry, with the 3% residual sugar quite apparent."
Frei Brothers,Chardonnay,84.5,20.0,2,"A very ripe Zin with dry, dusty tannins and a taste of cherry liqueur, its alcohol ever-present. It's got good bones for its style."
Frei Brothers,Merlot,87.0,20.0,1,"Sourced from several different Dundee Hills vineyards, this wraps its black cherry fruit in tart acids, chalky minerals, and a hint of iron. Substantial, muscular and stiff out of the bottle, it will blossom with further bottle age. It's already a sturdy, expressive, impressive wine with deep flavors of fruit, earth and rock."
Frei Brothers,Pinot Noir,90.0,27.0,1,"The famed Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vineyard also produces amazing Syrah, as evidenced in this wine, with aromas of black pepper, blackberries, leather and spearmint. The palate is dominated by plump boysenberry flavors, cut with licorice-led, slightly strong tannins and a eucalyptus and pine sap character on the finish."
Frei Brothers,Sauvignon Blanc,87.5,17.0,2,"A light, clear color suggests a lighthearted wine, but this coastal vineyard-designate delivers plenty of power around a core of damp, earthy wild strawberry and blackberry. Soft, with managed and integrated tannins, it's relatively high in acidity and is well structured, with a pleasant jamminess and aromas of freshly cut rose."
Frei Brothers,Zinfandel,85.33,20.0,3,"Medium-bodied and nicely integrated layers of cassis, black cherry and cola spice are on offer in this barrel selection of a single-vineyard designate. It's fleshy and velvety with a bite of acidity swirling throughout. It builds additional power and adds legs on the finish, and will cellar well, through 2022."
Freja,Pinot Noir,86.5,25.0,2,"Jean Hoefliger is the consulting winemaker for this wine, an earthy 100% expression of the variety that's rich and lush yet fully balanced in acidity. Dark truffle, forest floor and Bing cherry characterize the aromas and flavors, around a tightly wound core of intense fruit that explodes on the palate on the finish."
French Creek,Chardonnay,87.5,26.0,2,"There's a classic style to this Cabernet, from the enticing aromas of cassis, black cherry and licorice to the sizable yet velvety tannins that wrap flavors gracefully. Structured and medium in weight, the wine has a sense of restraint plus a balance of acidity and lushness. Enjoyable now, it will benefit with time, through 2020."
Frequency,G-S-M,91.0,38.0,1,"Deep and dark blueberry aromas are laced with blackberry-balsamic reduction, black tobacco, black sage and a brooding spice character on this blend of 71% Syrah, 24% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre. It's thick and chewy on the palate, with ripe purple fruits clinging to a dense backbone of bacon fat and fudge."
Frequency,Grenache,93.0,38.0,1,"This late-release wine from a Livermore stalwart smells spicy and exotically fruity, with herbal/menthol and cigar box accents. On the palate it is rich, generous, deep and broad-textured, lush in feel and full-bodied. The essence is like warm blackberry jam but without being sweet. All the goodness lingers on finish."
Frequency,Syrah,92.5,38.0,2,"This dry-farmed vineyard is often challenging for Winemaker Billy Wathen, but it worked this vintage, showing bright and ripe aromas of apple blossom, pear, honey and sweet lemon, all underlined by white-rock minerality. The lively palate shows lime soda and chalk flavors, with a pear-skin bitterness and ample acidity, which keeps the mouth tingling deep into the finish."
Friedeman,Chardonnay,89.5,34.75,4,"Juicy, soft and sublime, this vineyard site sits on the extreme Sonoma Coast, near the town of Annapolis, approaching the Mendocino County line. Fine tannins and bright acidity combine for a memorable taste experience, marked in fresh strawberry, raspberry and black pepper."
Friedeman,Pinot Noir,90.43,34.57,7,"Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton's shared vision for this popular grape is distinctive and rather unfamiliar for those seeking a buttery style. This shows chamomile, dandelion greens, Japanese pear and petrol on the nose, with bittery flavors of grapefruit pith, lemon juice and nectarine skins showing first. Patience allows wet wool, stone, sliced apples and white peach elements to emerge. Drink 2017–2027."
Frisk,Rosé,86.0,11.0,1,"Stainless-steel fermented and aged, it's lightly aromatic with notes of herbs and kiwi. The palate is medium-bodied with sweet tropical fruit flavors but the concentration doesn't seem there."
Frisson Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,95.0,1,"Not your average Zinfandel, this one could almost be a Syrah with all its peppery, meaty and smoky aromas and flavors. They are wild and different but puzzling. The wine is full-bodied, tannic and almost thick in texture."
Frisson Wines,Chardonnay,85.0,45.0,1,"This starts to fall flat even as it hits the mouth. It's got some puckery citrus and apple fruit, then rolls into a thin finish. The aftertaste shows some slightly bitter skin flavors."
Fritz,Chardonnay,87.5,33.5,2,"A blend of half Sémillon and half Chardonnay, this is an aromatic, fully fleshed-out wine that veers into richness without going too far. Swirling in layers of concentrated pear and lemon, it provides a long, substantial finish, ending in balanced acidity."
Fritz,Pinot Noir,94.0,50.0,1,"Merlot (44%) takes the lead on this wine followed by Cabernet Franc (29%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (18%), with the balance of blend of Petit Verdot and Malbec. Alluring aromas of black plum, earth, flowers and green herb are followed by generous, palate-coating dark-fruit flavors. It brings a sense of texture that captivates."
Fritz,Sauvignon Blanc,87.5,25.0,2,"Black cherry and blueberry fruit show on the dense, dark nose of this bottling, alongside clove, allspice, nutmeg, purple flower, crushed rosebuds and dust. Black and red plums show on the sip, as does chipped asphalt, charcoal and coffee. It's a standout in terms of darkness for a Pinot Noir."
Fritz,Sparkling Blend,90.0,42.0,1,"From the producer's estate vineyard planted on the Olivet Bench, this sublimely textured white is perfumed, zesty and complex. It delights in voluptuous layers of pear and honey in equal measure, showing both sides of deliciousness, fresh and fruity."
Fritz,Zinfandel,85.0,25.0,1,"Coming from a vineyard in The Rocks, this wine opens with aromas of savory herbs and moist earth, with flower petal and piercing cherry notes lurking the background. The palate is velvety in feel, putting a focus on elegance. It shows plenty of hang time on the finish."
Frog's Leap,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,55.0,1,"The winery's flagship offering, this wine is a blend of 60% Mourvèdre, 30% Grenache and 10% Syrah. It conjures up aromas of high-toned herbs, potpourri and the purest of cherry notes. The flavors coat the palate, showing a hypnotic sense of purity along with an impressive mouthfeel."
Frost Bitten,Riesling,88.0,13.0,1,"This is a spicy, vibrantly realized wine from a coastal ridge five miles from the Pacific Ocean dusted in sandy, loam soils. It's planted entirely to the Swan clone, which can contribute an undeniable wildness to the variety. Baked cherry meets spearmint and clove, the acidity light and bright with plenty of texture atop the medium-sized body."
Frostwatch,Chardonnay,93.0,45.0,2,"Mourvèdre (45%), Grenache (31%) and Syrah (12%) make up the majority of this wine, which is fleshed out with Counoise, Grenache Blanc and Picpoul. Vibrant aromas of cracked pepper, raspberry, underbrush, dried violets, smoked meat and herb are followed by elegant yet still flavorful fruit and savory notes that show a pleasing tartness and generous mouthfeel."
Frostwatch,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,24.0,1,"A blend of fruit from Olsen, Elephant Mountain and Boushey vineyards, this wine is expressive, with aromas of smoke, high-toned herb, dark raspberry, blue fruit and mineral. The flavors are fresh and focused, putting a premium on elegance with a finish that sails."
Frostwatch,Sémillon,84.0,24.0,1,"This wine beautifully blends vivid fruit, enticing spice and luxuriously creamy flavors that are concentrated, layered and complex. It pulls it all off gracefully due to underlying acidity that supports a lush texture and leads to a long finish."
Fulcrum,Chardonnay,92.0,55.0,1,"If the staunchly herbal and green-bean scents and flavors often found with this grape are your cup of tea, this will prove enjoyable. It's smooth and not overly tannic, with those intense green-bean aromatics and a taste of tomato."
Fulcrum,Petite Sirah,90.33,44.0,3,"This popular blend of seven red grapes is dark and strongly flavored with a streak of vanilla. There's nothing fancy here, just big, vanilla-soaked flavors, at an affordable price."
Fulcrum,Pinot Noir,91.82,56.36,11,"Strong tarry and asphalt notes show on the nose of this wine, with a touch of boysenberry. Similar elements play into the somewhat rough palate, where tarry tannins interplay with tart boysenberry, bolstered slightly by a touch of soy."
Fulkerson,Riesling,85.0,17.0,1,"All five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here, the greater percentages being Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Malbec, in almost equal proportion. Barbecue smoke enters the picture first, with a substantial aroma and taste of char. It makes for a one-dimensional experience."
Full Pull & Friends,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,34.0,2,"This wine, from a newly acquired property, is tart and young, grapy almost, with the fruit a little reduced. The wine seems to be in hiding. It falls off in the middle and finishes with tannin and little else. This may just need more time in bottle to blossom."
Full Pull & Friends,Cabernet Franc,91.0,32.0,2,"Cortina refers to the soil type. The wine shows forward, pretty fruit, mixing berries and cherries, and follows up with bright, clean, mouth-friendly flavors. Falls off in the finish, with some dry tannins."
Full Pull & Friends,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,34.0,2,"Smells very ripe, almost stewed, and it lives up to its name (The Monster) with big, rustic, extracted, alcoholic flavors. For those who like old-style Zin, with no-holds-barred power."
Full Pull & Friends,Merlot,90.5,34.0,2,"This is the first wine from this new winery. Clean, light berry fruit is the whole show, and it's a forward, fruity Zin with friendly, simple flavors."
Fullerton,Chardonnay,89.0,35.5,6,"This gets the award for the most confusing label of the month. It says Vigil “Tradicion” and also names the vineyard, then writes Mokelumne River Old Vines, and finishes with Lodi. Talk about information overload! Bottom line: it's a fruity, oaky, simple and straightforward bottle of Zin. 'Nuff said."
Fullerton,Pinot Noir,89.31,44.12,16,"Firm, fruity wine, with good clean varietal flavors. Simple and ripe, with a big, tannic finish."
Fullerton,Rosé,87.0,19.0,2,"Thick, chewy, cherry fruit, with lots of wood behind it. Simple, forward and quite pleasant, without pretension."
Furioso,Pinot Noir,92.0,60.0,2,"Some earthy elements mingle with the fruit, which has a ripe tomato edge. Good structure, without the harshness or heat that affects so many '97s. If anything, it's a little underripe, with bell pepper, beet and earthy flavors."
Furthermore,Pinot Noir,89.5,50.0,2,"The nose on this wine from the Willow Creek area plays between the lighter elements of bright red cherries and heavier hints of tar, with a bit of sour plum thrown in as well. The palate is loaded with chalky tannins, offering flavors of black cherries and licorice, but it could use some more time in bottle."
G & L Lurton,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.33,47.67,3,"Forward and quite light (the vintage was a cool one), this offers fruit flavors of pomegranate and tart berry. There is a generous swath of chocolate wrapping it, creating a rather silky yet simple, straightforward wine best enjoyed in the near term."
GEN 7,Red Blend,81.0,34.0,1,"If a Cabernet can be smooth and creamy, this one is. It offers plenty of fruit flavor, firm tannins that coat the mouth in a good way, plus a plush texture that keeps it from being even a bit harsh. With medium body, a great mouthfeel and lingering finish, there's much to like."
Gainey,Cabernet Sauvignon,95.0,60.0,1,"Tropical and creamy, the aromas thick in grapefruit and pineapple, this light, citrus-tinged, refreshing 100% Sauvignon Blanc is well-balanced and easy to enjoy, approachable with some depth."
Gainey,Chardonnay,91.0,38.0,3,"Well-made, well-balanced and medium-bodied, this combines moderate blackberry and black cherry flavors with subtle spicy notes. The texture is tannic enough to be great with food, but smooth enough to enjoy sipping."
Gainey,Pinot Noir,93.0,55.0,3,"Though not known as a particularly cool region, the hills southwest of San Jose turn out solid Pinot Noirs for this winery. Aromas recall olives, forest floor and cloves, and flavors are quite smooth, with buttered cherries, peppery spice, cola and vibrant acidity that cuts a clean, quick finish."
Gainey,Sauvignon Blanc,92.5,19.0,2,"On this blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon and 21% Petit Verdot from Adelaida Springs Ranch, iron-laced, gamy scents lead the nose, which also picks up aromas of elderberry and oak smoke. Plums and other purple fruit show on the palate, along with black licorice and strong but well-integrated tannins."
Galante,Malbec,88.0,32.0,1,"Producers Chris Condos and Richard Bruno put together a fairly priced wine, with aromas of herbed pie crust surrounding warm blackberry fruit. There's more smoked meat on the palate than ripe fruit, and it is quite tannic, so can handle heavy fare."
Galante,Red Blend,86.33,31.67,3,"Wood aromas of cedar are expertly spliced with purple fruits on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Petite Sirah and Merlot. A touch of greenness on the palate gives those deep purple fruits some depth, but the tannins are quite gripping, and should release more with time. Drink 2018 onward."
Galante,White Blend,91.0,25.0,1,"Some light Graham cracker aromas come up quickly, but in the mouth the wine all but disappears. Watery and thin, it shows little promise of further improvement."
Galatea Effect,Pinot Noir,90.0,95.0,2,"This sports a smoky aroma, wrapped into tight, tart red fruits. There is an ashy undertone, and somewhat granular tannins."
Galatea Effect,Rosé,86.0,40.0,1,"This 100% varietal wine seems to still be in its shell, with light notes of coffee, plum and licorice along with other barrel spices. The fruit flavors are supple with some heft to the tannins and a tart lick of acidity that spruces things up. A lot of good things are going on here but they don't quite all come together."
Galatea Effect,Syrah,89.5,120.0,2,"A strong percentage of Petit Verdot (14%) marks this wine, a mouthful of sanguine cranberry and lightly ripe red fruit that's high in acidity and balanced by a richer dollop of milk chocolate, particularly on the finish."
Galaxy,White Blend,89.0,50.0,1,"Light, lemony and crisp, this refreshing wine has some layers of complex herb midpalate and remains bright in acidity through the finish. From both the Miller Ranch in Yountville and Soda Creek Vineyard."
Galerie,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,50.0,4,"Blueberries, smoke and pepper-crusted beef aromas emerge on this solid offering. There's a lot happening on the palate, with flavors of tobacco, blackberries, dark plums and purple flowers, all grounded in tart plum-skin tannins."
Galerie,Riesling,94.5,32.5,2,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (52%), Syrah (24%), Merlot (19%) and Malbec, this appealing single-vineyard wine suggests vanilla, freshly ground coffee, dark fruit and spices. It's sweet and richly flavored, with a firm squeeze of tannins."
Galerie,Sauvignon Blanc,92.67,30.0,6,"This 100% varietal wine offers notes of coffee, vanilla and plum. It's medium bodied with espresso flavors and firm, slightly gritty tannins."
Gallegos,Pinot Noir,92.0,41.5,4,"Mineral and wet stone are a pleasant entry into this wine, which continues into flavors of pretty pear, melon and citrus. The presence of oak on both the nose and palate is not overwhelming."
Gallegos,Red Blend,90.0,40.0,1,"The wine smells rich and opulent, like rose petals and bay leaves in a flood of blackberry jam, but tastes balanced and dry. It's an unusual table wine and a fun journey to take."
Gallo Signature Series,Pinot Noir,86.0,35.0,1,"Aromatically compelling, this offers a complex mix of clover, chocolate and cherry in the nose. It is a substantial, fruit-packed wine, with cherry and plum fruit, a full-bodied midpalate, mouthfilling texture and nicely integrated barrel spices. It finishes with a streak of Meyer lemon acidity. Drink now through 2030."
Gallo of Sonoma,Chardonnay,87.0,23.0,1,"Winemaker Blair Fox loves this single-clone bottling, and for good reason. It's intensely dark in color but not overextracted, with soil, eucalyptus, black plum and baking spice aromas. Rounded strawberry and raspberry fruit shows on the medium-bodied palate, with star anise and white pepper accents."
Galvan,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,95.0,1,"Winemaker Bill Brosseau hits a single vineyard home run with this bottling from one of the Central Coast's oldest sites. It shows exotic plum, tangy cranberry, pine needle, juniper and pencil shaving scents on the nose. The palate is steeped in mulberry, marjoram and curry-like Indian spices, proving dynamic and delicious in the most compelling ways."
Galvan,Cabernet Franc,91.0,36.0,1,"An aromatic textural wine, Wichmann sources fruit from the winery's oldest vines. Strawberry and cherry flavors are woven into details of citrus and tea. This elegant well-proportioned effort provides a feminine contrast to the sturdy Coast Range bottling."
Galvan,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,85.0,1,"This impressive 100% varietal wine shows focused red fruit, a tropical edge of coconut and firm, structured tannin. Sage, cedar, tobacco and black pepper notes provide a sultry, savory counterpoint to the fruit, balanced with moderate acidity. Enjoy 2023–2033."
Galvan,Red Blend,92.0,36.0,1,"Cranberry, baked rhubarb, anise and crushed slate aromas show on the nose of this always-excellent bottling from the Franscioni family. The palate abounds with energy, driving black raspberry fruit accented with earthy loam, fennel, oregano and juniper through a compellingly round midpalate."
Galvan,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,20.0,1,"This standout Rocks District wine brings earth shaking aromas of black-olive brine, tapenade, green olive, stargazer lilies, orange peel and crushed gravel. The smoked meat, charcuterie and blue-fruit flavors don't hold back, bringing a lovely sense of texture and detail. It's an intense wine that completely demands your attention."
Gamache,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.5,46.25,4,"Cherry pie and nuanced spice flavors buoy this delicately layered, medium-bodied vineyard designate that's built of robust fruit and supported quietly by oak. A thread of white pepper persists throughout, making it especially irresistible."
Gamache,Cabernet Franc,88.5,33.0,4,"Intensely aromatic, yet big and even chunky in the mouth, this young wine remains compressed and hard-edged. Give it ample aeration, and cranberry, blackberry and black cherry fruits come alive. Dense with fruit and detailed with wet stone minerality, this should be cellared a few years, and consumed from 2020 to 2030."
Gamache,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.62,40.75,8,"The estate's 13 acres were first planted in 1999. This lovely wine expresses itself with perfectly ripened black-cherry fruit, a dash of cola, and an underpinning of clean earth, complemented with a touch of mineral. The finish is superb."
Gamache,Malbec,87.33,29.33,3,"There is a darker fruit spectrum evident in the reserve, with notes of coffee, smoke, black fruits, a touch of charred wood all worked through, and without damping the core fruit flavors. Those bright flavors spotlight raspberry, plum and black cherry. A light cola flavor pokes through, with ripe tannins and proportionate acids. The barrel treatment is beautifully applied, adding sweet spice to the finish."
Gamache,Merlot,87.43,25.14,7,"This gorgeous wine deftly integrates a lively mix of currant, cherry, breakfast tea and dried leaves into a seamless and seductive whole. Produced from vines dating back to the early 1970s, it finishes with a delicious streak of milk chocolate. Drink now through 2030."
Gamache,Red Blend,86.0,18.0,2,"This single-vineyard estate wine is made by Nils Venge and Tom Rinaldi, who have somehow managed to capture quiet elegance and powerful fruit at the same time. Red-fruit driven, it's round and rich, with moderate tannin and cassis, clove and black pepper highlights."
Gamache,Riesling,89.0,16.5,2,"Polished in every way, this brings an enticing potpourri of almond paste, apple and white pepper. Wild yeast fermentation in oak (30% new) marries complex components in perfect precise balance. As with all the Ponzi 2014 Chardonnays, the acids are bright but not biting, and the wines are built for both near-term enjoyment and medium-term aging."
Gamache,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,22.5,2,"From a prime site relatively high in elevation for the appellation, this wine shows beautiful, crisp acidity, as robust layers of mountain raspberry, blackberry and coffee flavor vie for attention. Full bodied and densely structured, it unfurls in wisps of black licorice and clove on the lengthy finish."
Gamache,Syrah,86.5,30.0,2,"This pretty, floral wine made entirely from Chardonnay grapes from this site is both creamy and crisp. It offers impressive length, acidity and stoniness, accenting its focused green apple flavor. As it opens, it takes on a richer honey-like tone that adds further complexity and deliciousness."
Gamba,Zinfandel,86.0,45.0,2,"The aromas pop, with notes of orange peel, ember, cured meat, black olive and wet stone, with purple fruit lurking in the background. The palate is surprisingly fruit forward, with plum and savory flavors that coat the palate from end to end. The finish glides for a full 30 seconds."
Gamble Family Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,90.0,1,"Focused and dense, this intense wine captures the essence of ripe raspberries. Aged in 50% new French oak, it's got a strong vein of coffee and mocha. The flavors broaden out and penetrate, finishing with highlights of cedar, cinnamon and dark chocolate. Drink now through the 2020s, but decant if you want the full expression."
Garavin,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.67,85.67,3,"This is an outlier in the Brian Carter lineup of Euro-style blends, a single vineyard, pure varietal Cabernet. As such, it drills down deeply into the character of Washington terroir as captured in a Cab-friendly site, the Stone Tree Vineyard in the heart of the Wahluke Slope AVA. Dark, deep, concentrated, smoky, with tendrils of earth and rock reaching all the way through the tart and tannic finish."
Garnet,Pinot Noir,90.0,30.0,1,"If there is a better vineyard than Boushey in Washington for Syrah, it has not yet been discovered. This young wine tastes like younger vines, with more green and less meat in the flavors. But the complexity and depth of Boushey fruit is there, and the wine takes you on a ride through a mélange of intriguing herb, fruit, cured meat and barrel flavors."
Garnet Vineyards,Pinot Noir,86.67,36.0,3,"A dry, late-harvest wine from 20-year-old vines. Floral with a subtle honey note, more like pollen; lemon and orange candy, sleek and deep."
Garofalo,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,14.0,1,"Here is the most engaging offering of the winery's 2013 single vineyard Pinots. It's bright with red-berry fruit and tropical-candy highlights. Meyer lemon peeks in, and the tangy fruit flavors continue into a finish of medium weight and length. Drink now and over the next couple of years."
Garofalo,Viognier,86.0,16.0,1,"Reustle pioneered this variety (they now make three different bottlings) and this may be the best yet. The texture and depth are impressive, as is the detailed mix of melon and white peach, with just a faint trace of vanilla."
Garré,Merlot,82.0,35.0,1,"There is tons of lively action packed into the nose of this wine, from rosebuds and zesty cherry cola to cinnamon spice and rainbow peppercorns. The texture is relatively light on the sip, and yet grippy tannins and a bursting acidity swim across the palate, showing vibrant iron and red-fruit flavors."
Gary Farrell,Chardonnay,92.74,50.0,27,"Whiffs of cedar and baking spices lead to ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors in this well-balanced and easy to appreciate wine. The ample fruit flavors are hard to resist, and the supple, modestly tannic texture is just right."
Gary Farrell,Pinot Noir,92.73,58.97,33,"Meaty, smoky aromas and good, high-amplitude fruit flavors give a robust personality to this full-bodied, dry and firmly tannic wine. It will make a good pairing with pasta, roasted birds or grilled meat."
Gary Farrell,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,28.0,1,"Aromas of gingerbread cookies with a black-cherry glaze meet black gravel and a touch of asphalt on the nose of this complex and flavorful bottling. The palate blends the brightness of red cherry and strawberry fruit with a rocky minerality, spiced up by black pepper and settling into a plum-skin groove toward the finish."
Gary Farrell,Zinfandel,92.4,48.0,5,"The debut release for this producer is a bright garnet shade. Exhuberant and broad, the palate is bursting with cranberry, blue plum and Bing cherry flavors. Drink over the next year or two, while it is at its freshest."
Gecko,Rosé,85.0,15.0,1,"This is a full-bodied, ripe, well-made and fruity wine, subdued and velvety on the palate in bright red fruit, leather, mint and cinnamon."
Gen5,Red Blend,85.33,10.0,3,"What jumps out immediately is a bright spicy scent. The forward fruit is a zesty mix of cranberry, guava and citrus, and the flavors just punch up the palate in a most delicious way. Drink this over the next couple of years while it retains its freshness."
Gen5,Zinfandel,85.5,13.0,2,"This is fruity and ripe, forward and round, with appealing tropical fruit flavors. There's moderate, but adequate, acidity, and the flavors are rounded off with a toasty note from aging 10 months in 30% new French oak. Drink this now through 2018."
Generation 7,Red Blend,84.0,28.0,1,"When a rosé pushes past 14% alcohol, that's an indication of a pretty potent wine. Here's a fine example, showcasing ripe strawberry and peach fruit, with excellent concentration and mouth-filling flavors. Using all free-run juice, this is fresh and full-bodied."
Genius Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,75.0,1,"Tonella has 16% Merlot within, from the estate vineyard around the winery. Cedar, currant and dried herb greet the nose and palate before allowing chalky, dusty tannin to season layers of chocolate and black cherry, staying structured and bright from start to finish."
Genoa,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,37.0,2,"Here you'll find a mix of tart citrus (principally orange peel) with wild berry fruit. It's a tart and tangy wine, with a dash of herb and some earthy tannins. Optimal drinking should be 2018 through 2022."
Genoa,Merlot,88.0,33.0,1,"Dry and delicate with mixed fresh herbs, melon, green berry, spice and rock—lots of rock. It shows surprising length and develops nicely in the throat, seeming to add flesh as you taste. A really nice bottle."
Genoa,Red Blend,88.17,30.33,6,"This is the first time a Cabernet Franc has been made at Spring Valley since 2003. It's rich and earthy, tannic and concentrated, with plum and black cherry dusted with light mocha. Smooth and supple in the mouth, it glides into a tasty finish with toasted almonds."
Genoa,Sangiovese,88.0,24.0,3,"Elysium is crafted from Black Muscat grapes grown in the Central Valley near Madera and it tastes of raspberry jam and citrus peel, thick in texture but holding on to enough acidity to balance itself out. The residual sugar is 17.52%. Mix with Champagne for a California-style Kir Royale, the bubbles will really make it pop."
Genoa,White Blend,86.33,19.0,3,"With almost half of this wine aged in new French oak, it's barrel forward with notes of char and caramel along with tropical fruit. This fruit expression helps to retain a sense of elegance that carries through the finish."
Geoff Tate,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,35.0,1,"This new Mistral is roughly half Grenache, the rest a mix of Syrah and four other grapes. It's immediately appealing, loaded with brown spices, plum cake, raisins and chocolate."
Geoff Tate,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,25.0,1,"A majority of Cabernet Franc combines with 23% Cabernet Sauvignon and 23% Merlot. The result is a dense expression of cherry, strawberry and vanilla, sharp on the tongue in tar and tobacco, the tannins tightly wound."
Gershon Bachus,Cabernet Franc,90.0,45.0,1,"Quite intense aromas of plum brandy and kirsch are boosted with scents of iron and black pepper on this bottling. The palate shows stewed cherries and strawberries, and there is both acidity and tannic grip, proving this to be a complete and solid wine."
Gershon Bachus,Grenache,92.0,40.0,1,"Lightly toasty, this wraps its yellow apple fruit with citrus rind. A hint of butter cookie comes up gently as it winds down in a soft finish."
Gershon Bachus,Red Blend,87.0,50.0,1,"This winery produces luxuriously rich wines, and this blend of 47% Merlot, 30% Petit Verdot, 12% Malbec and 11% Cabernet Sauvignon fits right in. Aromas suggest vanilla-cherry cream, fresh cracked dark chocolate, mulberry extract and root beer. Cola, blackberries and woody herbs show once sipped."
Gershon Bachus,White Blend,89.0,32.0,1,"Almost equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon (with slightly more Merlot), this is a reduced and approachable wine. It's slightly syrupy-thick on the palate, juicy in clove, plum and blueberry. A trace of minerality fights for attention around a medium body, finishing fairly quick."
Gersing,Pinot Noir,88.0,39.0,2,"Melon, peach and honeysuckle swirl together on the very ripe nose, thanks to the blend of 42% Viognier, 24% Marsanne, 21% Grenache Blanc, 11% Roussanne and 2% Picpoul Blanc. Tropical fruits also power the peachy palate, yet it finishes crisply with a mineral sharpness, smartly combining the warm climate yet unique soils of the appellation."
Geyser Peak,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.5,40.0,2,"The Central Coast's pioneering sparkling house offers a quite-pink bubbly with aromas of lemonade, yeast, white rocks and ruby-red grapefruit flesh. The palate shows sour strawberry and lime zest."
Geyser Peak,Chardonnay,88.67,26.0,3,"This blend of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah grapes is so packed with flavors that they seem to stumble over each other at first. It leads with a definitely earthy aroma that fades, but then the flavors come out—effusive, chocolaty, almost sweet and definitely ripe. It is full bodied and rich in texture."
Geyser Peak,Pinot Noir,88.0,36.0,1,"Rounded aromas of melon and salty peaches rise to the nose on this wine from the Monterey County appellation just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The palate is driven by citrus, grass and a rather extreme sense of sea salt, enhanced with mouth-watering acidity and a nectarine flesh finish. It's tasty though varietally uncommon."
Geyser Peak,Red Blend,85.0,30.0,1,"With a vivid golden color, bold and buttery aromas, and rich, almost nutty flavors, this is a full-bore rendering. It is full bodied and brings out the most flavorful aspects of the grape. The texture is rich and almost thick, and the buttery nuances linger on the finish."
Geyser Peak,Sauvignon Blanc,85.33,22.0,3,"Earthy in cranberry and pomegranate, this is a new vineyard-designate offering from the producer, light in texture and tannin imprint. Soft, it gets meatier and denser in intensity through the finish, with a backbone of acidity and grip."
Ghost Block,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,60.0,1,"A fruit and barrel style predominates on this wine, with aromas of Mounds Bar and spice playing off the variety's red and black fruit. The flavors are elegantly styled yet bring a pretty texture followed by a tart, cranberry-filled finish."
Ghost Pines,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.5,23.0,2,"From a ripe and picture-perfect growing season, this wine has luscious and concentrated waves of fig, melon and vanilla, rounded out by an inviting, floral edge of orange blossom. Oaky toast and nutmeg highlight the midpalate, before the wine finishes in a sea of minerality."
Ghost Pines,Chardonnay,83.5,20.0,2,"Made using techniques employed in crafting Pinot Noir, this wine has 5% Viognier blended in. It conveys a rustic sense of leather and black pepper, with waves of high-toned cherry, plum and brooding blueberry that combine in flavor. Its concentrated structure is lifted by a lilt of acidity on the finish."
Ghost Pines,Merlot,85.5,21.5,2,"The wine's barrel aging comes through immediately, with its toasted nut and vanilla nose. On the palate, the wine is balanced—with its citrus fruit, spice and touch of flowers. Elegant and easy to love—a good use of oak."
Ghost Pines,Pinot Noir,86.33,23.0,3,"The Roman numeral 23 is an indication of the vineyard age; in the blend is 20% Cabernet planted at the same time. This is stiff and herbal, with brambly, wild raspberry and light cherry fruit and a dusty ash flavor as the tannins fade. Good length and balance."
Ghost Pines,Red Blend,87.5,23.0,2,"Pleasant, with soft texture and tannins and notes of cinnamon and clove, this Lodi Merlot drops a bit at the finish and is 13.1% alcohol."
Ghost Pines,Zinfandel,88.0,20.0,2,"Cherry liqueur, candied rose petals, rhubarb, sweet truffle and wet earth converge for a very sultry and dynamic nose on this bottling, showing that quite a bit of complexity can come from one clone. Well-integrated flavors of dark red fruit, vanilla and nutmeg show on the sip, which is woven together by persistent acidity."
Ghostrider,Red Blend,89.0,14.0,2,"The tang of orange rinds and fresh lemon cake meet with hints of toasted coconut and white flowers on the nose of this solid bottling by Bill Foley's eponymous winery. The texture is crisp but grippy and tense on the sip, with seared orange slices and oak smoke flavors."
Ghostrunner,Rhône-style Red Blend,86.0,14.0,1,"There's a distinctive old-school quality that comes from these century-old vines, which make a slightly lighter wine with intriguing, almost pre-aged aromas of dried cherry, balsamic raspberry and salt-and-pepper spice. The palate is driven by a crushed rock texture and a bright acidity that drives deep into the finish, with flavors of aged cola and dried red fruit. It's even greater with a slight chill."
Gibbs,Cabernet Franc,87.0,25.0,2,"Very light in the glass, this single vineyard expression shows, fresh pomegranate and rose petals on the expressive nose. It's tight and bright in the glass, with light raspberry, cranberry, fennel and chaparral spice."
Gibbs,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,32.0,2,"Richly layered with fruit, this full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend has wonderful concentration, a good sense of depth and a creamy texture that has mild and supportive tannins. The mouthfeel is very supple and the dark berry and black-cherry flavors are ripe and delicious."
Gibbs,Chardonnay,88.25,30.25,4,"Very light in the glass, this bottling shows tons of underripe cranberry, dried rose petals, marjoram, white pepper and tangy olives on the nose. The light-bodied palate shows similar qualities, with fully extracted flavors of tart red fruits, purple flowers and white tea."
Gibbs,Merlot,88.0,24.0,3,"Plump aromas of white peach, lemon syrup, butterscotch and prominent oak show on the nose of this bottling, one of the richer ones in the current Talley lineup. The oak smoke flavors mix with vanilla and a finish of caramel on the palate, but the winery's reliably bright acidity hold the larger elements in check."
Gibbs,Red Blend,89.0,22.0,1,"Neutral French oak played a part in this wine's fermentation, giving it weight and substance without distraction. Exotic on the nose, it's fleshy and high toned in guava and lemon zest, with a memorable length of mineral-like stone that gives it texture and complexity."
Gibbs,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,18.0,1,"Buoyant aromas of boysenberry juice, white pepper and a touch of rosemary show on the nose of this blend of 34% Merlot, 33% Tempranillo and 33% Syrah, whose name means “my steps” and is an homage to the parents of winemaker Edgar Torres. Sticky tannins frame a medium-weight body full of sage, bay leaf and peppercorn flavors, which decorate the elderberry fruit. This is still a very young wine."
Gifford Hirlinger,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,16.0,1,"Crisp and clean aromas of chalk and lime pith meet with riper touches of honeydew and Anjou pear on the nose of this blend of 66% Grenache Blanc and 34% Roussanne, which hints at a biting acidity on the sip. The freshness extends to the palate, where riper guava tones are deftly cut by citrus peels and finished with a minty lift. The structure is tense and ideal, while the acidity is available but not overwhelming."
Gifford Hirlinger,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,34.0,2,"Intricate baking spice aromas and buttery apple-tart flavors meet a delicate yet expansive mouthfeel in this light-bodied, irresistible and off-dry wine. The spicy elements weave in and out of the silky texture and continue to echo on the finish."
Gifford Hirlinger,Malbec,90.0,36.0,1,"Beautifully bright aromas of pomegranate, cherry, rose petals, hibiscus and cola draw the nose deeply into this bottling by Sonja Magdevski, who's focusing almost exclusively on Grenache these days. The tannins are firmer than expected for a lighter style, carrying impressive flavors of violet, cola and rose. It's delicate but grippy."
Gifford Hirlinger,Merlot,87.33,30.0,3,"This vineyard-designated wine includes 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Syrah. The Syrah component seems to take over, in the form of tart berry, herb and dried leaf flavors. The alcohol, which is 15.5%, mutes any other complexities. It's a nice wine, but it doesn't offer standard Washington Merlot flavors."
Gifford Hirlinger,Petit Verdot,88.5,33.0,2,"Syncline's winemaker James Mantone is putting out a fascinating lineup of single-vineyard 100%-varietal wines from unusual grapes like Grenache Blanc. Lime and grapefruit scents and flavors are evident, along with light Asian pear and jicama highlights. The cool vintage emphasizes a gin-like botanical flavor. This is a balanced effort, with a medium-long finish."
Gifford Hirlinger,Petite Verdot,89.5,27.0,2,"This is a relatively gentle, light Cabernet Franc. It reveals a pretty, juicy blueberry flavor as well as a muted herb note. A whiff of violet and a dash of vanilla run through the finish."
Gifford Hirlinger,Red Blend,88.25,17.5,4,"Made from Celilo Vineyard fruit, this has a sharp-toned bite to its aromas and flavors. Hints of tropical fruits can be found, but the core of the wine is citrusy. A suggestion of light caramel surfaces on the finish."
Gifford Hirlinger,Tempranillo,87.0,36.0,1,"Three-fifths Merlot, one quarter Cab Franc and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend shows ripe fruit scents of raisin and prune, offset with baking spices and plenty of chocolate and espresso. Full-throttle, smooth and concentrated, it's a big, concentrated, somewhat in-your face-effort, but delicious all the way through."
Gilbert Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,28.0,1,"Rich and toasty, this is a swirl of mocha and raspberry doing a lovely pas de deux. It's sharp and focused, a little high-toned, and thoroughly delicious."
Gilbert Cellars,Chardonnay,84.25,18.5,4,"The best of the new releases from Michael Florentino, which has changed hands since this vintage was harvested. Autumnal flavors marry vivid, distinctive fruit to hints of leaf and citrus, elegant and complex."
Gilbert Cellars,Gewürztraminer,84.0,15.0,1,"Dark, deep purple in color, this Petite grown in Contra Costa is still quite closed and tight with no signs of opening anytime soon."
Gilbert Cellars,Grenache,87.0,26.0,1,"The oak is at the fore, with notes of roasted coffee beans, char and sawdust. The tannins are quite grippy with vanilla flavors taking over."
Gilbert Cellars,Malbec,83.0,26.0,2,"The winery's first vineyard-designated Chardonnay, this comes from a vineyard in the Oak Knoll District AVA near Yountville, a relatively cooler area of the Napa Valley. Light golden in color, it offers pear and fig and is light in weight with a substantial finish of creamy vanilla."
Gilbert Cellars,Red Blend,85.0,15.0,1,"This companion to the winery's “Right Blend” is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, the rest an even mix of Merlot and Cab Franc. It's still a little stiff, lightly leathery, and shows a streak of green in the finish. But inside is some good Red Mountain material. A good decanting helps to open it up."
Giornata,Aglianico,92.0,37.5,2,"Floral on the nose, this is a light, pretty Chardonnay steeped in straightforward citrus and apple. It has been aged partially in new French oak but doesn't come off as oaky."
Giornata,Nebbiolo,92.0,45.0,2,"Cherry cola and cardamom scents start the experience with this blend. A boost of Petite Sirah contributes licorice flavor to the midpalate, and a chocolate cake with mocha frosting flavor to the finish. There's ample grip to the strong tannins, so even though it's already five years old, it will continue to smooth through 2016."
Giornata,Pinot Grigio,88.0,35.0,1,"Half of this wine was barrel fermented in mostly new French oak; the other half done in stainless. Peaches and butter are the main flavors, with a soft, pretty finish that brings a streak of caramel."
Giornata,Red Blend,88.5,32.5,2,"This is a young, meaty Pinot, a bottle of substantial red cherry, earthy mushroom and soil that's bright and layered with a heartiness to the texture and finish. The back label mentions that the grapes were sourced from Bacigalupi Vineyards, a longstanding star in the Russian River Valley."
Girard,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.5,40.0,2,"A fine effort, with an inviting swirl of earthy components. Citrus, spice, earth, compost, coffee grounds and cinnamon comprise this detailed, aromatic wine. It sits squarely in the classic mold of the better Walla Walla Syrahs."
Girard,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,87.0,45.0,1,"Quite inky in the glass, this bottling shows black currant, black cherry and hearty violets on the nose. The palate is quite dark with a strong core flavor of black coffee, enhanced by loamy soils, crushed lava rocks and a touch of tarragon. A thick palate is sliced by bright acidity."
Girard,Zinfandel,89.0,24.0,1,"Potent aromas of road tar and black pepper meet very concentrated blackberry jam flavors and a sweet but not syrupy mouthfeel in this very dark-colored and full-bodied dessert wine. Made from traditional Portuguese grape varieties, the wine's density and richness of fruit is impressive, and everything tastes in balance."
Girardet,Baco Noir,87.0,35.0,1,"Lovely golden color highlights a balanced, floral and pretty late-harvest expression of apricot jam in this nuanced wine, which is relatively low in alcohol with 12.3% residual sugar. It offers viscosity that doesn't overpower, making it ideal for pairing with hard pungent cheeses or vanilla ice cream."
Girardet,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,38.0,1,"Concentrated aromas of violets and rose buds meet with black raspberry on the nose of this bottling. Quite light in the glass, it's full of tart red-fruit flavors, from cranberry to red-plum skins, with herbal tones on the midpalate: oregano, marjoram and dried lavender. The finish is grippy and driven by menthol."
Girardet,Cayuga,84.0,19.0,1,"Robustly concentrated, this is a rich rewarding wine exuberantly layered in black raspberry and blackberry flavor. Boldly structured, with depth and length for days, it hits the palate with pleasing jolts of cinnamon, clove and black licorice."
Girardet,Pinot Noir,86.2,34.6,5,"Waxy plum, cherry and a thread of oak accent a full-bodied warmth of soft tannin in this lovely wine, which also unfurls savory elements of cedar and graphite. Succulent, it shows the remarkable acidity for which the site is known."
Girardet,Red Blend,86.0,14.4,5,"Tangy aromas of lemon curd meet with warmer touches of Marcona almonds and cider-laced popcorn on the dynamic nose of this bottling. The palate starts with a melted butter richness before tangy citrus peels and savory sea salts combine for a long finish, where both butterscotch and vanilla also make an appearance."
Girardet,Riesling,87.25,14.25,4,"This beloved annual bottling by Randall Grahm blends 39% Mourvèdre, 33% Grenache, 26% Syrah and 2% Cinsaut to create a very savory, Old World-style expression, with aromas of roasted game, pencil shavings, dried red fruits and blood. The palate is very iron-rich and rustic, with uncrushed black peppercorns and raw and dried meat flavors."
Girardet,Rosé,84.0,16.0,1,"Classic and compelling aromas of rose petal, candied boysenberry, hibiscus reduction and vanilla brioche show on the nose of this wine from a rugged appellation east of the Salinas Valley. The firmly structured palate shows rose petals and tart berries, dusted by fennel pollen, white pepper and chaparral spice."
Girardet,Syrah,89.0,38.0,2,"Pretty and forward, this lovely wine bursts forth with raspberry and sweet cherry tomato fruit flavors. A slight mintiness can also be detected, all within the context of an impeccably balanced, firm, pleasingly acidic young red wine."
Girardet,Tempranillo,87.0,59.0,2,"Firm and tartly wound, with cassis and black cherry at the core of a young, stiffly tannic, Cabernet-based blend. Black fruits are nuanced with earth and olive, smoke and graphite, all subtle but definitely in view."
Glen Ellen,Pinot Grigio,84.0,10.0,1,"The rarest of the Spring Valley wines, this pure Cabernet Sauvignon offers ripe plum fruit flavors, wrapped in baking chocolate and licorice. It finishes with accents of sandalwood and citrus."
Glen Ellen,Zinfandel,82.0,10.0,1,"The price on the Ethos Reserve has dropped significantly, making it an especially good value for a full-on, toasty and buttery Chardonnay. A harmonious mélange of tree fruits and tropical nuances—papaya and banana stand out—with a smooth and luscious mouthfeel."
Glen Fiona,Red Blend,85.0,25.0,1,"One would like to see more aromatics, considering the variety, but it remains enjoyable with a lightly spritzy palate with off-dry red-apple and stone-fruit flavors. A straightforward, easy drinker."
Glen Fiona,Syrah,87.75,30.0,4,"Strong oak aromas and flavors wrap around this full-bodied, rather tannic and bold Merlot. It shows ripe fruit flavors and a gripping texture that makes it appropriate to match with red meat. Blended with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon."
Glennhawk,Red Blend,87.0,30.0,1,"Appealing aromas of blueberry and vanilla make for a very solid Bordeaux blend. Flavors of plum, cranberry and pomegranate lead into a licorice finish."
Glenora,Riesling,86.0,10.0,1,"Confusingly labeled as Pivot Blanc (not Pinot Blanc), this is actually a Riesling! Off dry, lightly fruity, with pleasant flavors of lemon and breakfast tea, honey and chamomile, it's best consumed young and chilled."
Gloria Ferrer,Champagne Blend,90.0,32.0,1,"This brings an intriguing assortment of dried fruit including pear, spiced apple and apricot. It drinks off dry, with abundant stone fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
Gloria Ferrer,Chardonnay,89.29,29.86,7,"Aged in just one-third new French oak, this mostly shows the fruit, along with notes of green herbs, plum and currant accented by vanilla. The palate is medium bodied, slightly viscous in feel with a tart finish and dry tannins."
Gloria Ferrer,Pinot Blanc,90.0,30.0,1,"The notes of barnyard overwhelm the varietal's cherry, floral and herb tones, with the palate quite elegant in its styling. Tasted twice with consistent notes."
Gloria Ferrer,Pinot Noir,89.12,39.12,8,"A bright cranberry color, this is fruity and dry, simple and ready to drink immediately. It brings some slightly bitter tannins into the finish."
Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling Blend,91.14,36.82,22,"This smells like beef broth and tastes savory, vegetal and smoky. The impression is rustic, earthy and lean."
Glunz,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,35.0,1,"This could be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon; the only other grape is Cab Franc (11%). The vineyard's characteristic lush black cherry fruit is surrounded by even darker components: earth, balsamic, baking chocolate, and espresso. There's an interesting walnut flavor (from the barrels?) and the fruit threads through to the very end of a long finish, supported by firm acids."
Gnarly Head,Pinot Grigio,85.0,10.0,1,"A taut, tense fight between the acids and sugars highlight this excellent dessert wine. A strong streak of spicy grain runs straight through the compact citrus and honey fruit flavors. The sweetness is neither cloying nor syrupy—rather, it neatly laces the wine together."
Gnarly Head,Red Blend,87.0,12.0,9,"This elegant, refined, ageworthy, pure Cabernet is sourced from the oldest vines at Windrow, which date back about two decades. There is plenty of round cherry fruit in the core of the wine, along with red plum, golden raisin, and Christmas cake spices. Cinnamon and chocolate scents waft up from the glass, nothing overblown, but exotic and compelling."
Gnarly Head,White Blend,85.0,12.0,1,"Certain Yakima valley vineyards attain a riveting complexity with Syrah—Dineen is one of them. The mix of wild berry, pomegranate syrup, coffee liqueur, composted earth, smoke and chocolate is compelling. This is Syrah that stands apart from most other New World versions, has the acid and balance to age, and the complexity to keep you coming back for another glass."
Gnarly Head,Zinfandel,87.17,11.83,6,"Winemaker Bill Owen (the ‘O' in O•S) has a knack for making white wines from red wine vineyards. This pungent, ripe, stylish Sauvignon Blanc/Sémillon blend is a fine example. The fruit flavors are thick and juicy— pineapple, golden apple, citrus—and the herbaceous nature of the grape has been transmuted into a sweet grassy streak, supported with mouth-searing acids. It's a roller-coaster ride, and delicious all along the way."
Goat Bubbles,Pinot Blanc,91.5,39.0,2,"A rusty red color, this hearty rose shows bright red cherry, dark strawberry, sultry plum and clove spice aromas. The palate is quite rich and full-bodied with punchy plum and raspberry flavors. A bit unctuous for a pink wine."
Goat Bubbles,Pinot Noir,91.67,54.0,3,"A blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier, the aromas of wheat and almond are quite light. The flavors are elegant and offer promise but lack the concentration to deliver it."
Goat Bubbles,Rosé,92.0,42.0,1,"This is a mild-mannered, softly one-dimensional version of the variety, robust in chocolate mocha and blueberry jam that finishes easily."
Goat Bubbles,Sparkling Blend,91.22,43.11,9,"Baked blackberries, purple flowers and a touch of leather show on the nose of this hearty bottling. The palate is framed by extremely strong, hard-to-cut tannins, which hold burned flavors of black coffee and charred berries."
Golden Cluster,Sémillon,88.0,65.0,1,"Raisin-baked plum defines this hearty, full-bodied and ultraripe wine, rich in red berry and robust on the finish."
Golden Ridge,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.5,27.75,4,"This wine is quite clear in the glass and a touch tart on the palate, finding its way to a full-bodied, slightly flabby and gummy texture and sense of heaviness."
Golden Ridge,Merlot,89.0,29.0,1,"Apple cider, night jasmine, ripe pears and orange cream aromas show on this sweeter bottling. The palate is quite clean and crisp, with rich apple juice flavors and a tactile acidity that fades fairly quickly. It's quite sweet."
Goldschmidt,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.33,95.67,6,"It's not often that you see Charbono in a Cabernet bottling, but it works. This wine boasts aromas of ripe cassis, red cherry and woody chocolate. The tannins are pronounced and chalky, giving a full mouthfeel, with sharp flavors of tart cherry and a strong acidity."
Goodfellow,Chardonnay,91.6,36.8,5,"This aromatically pleasing wine brings notes of black licorice, barrel tones, coffee and green herbs. It's concentrated and flavorful with abundant cherry notes backed by expertly managed tannins. It doesn't shy away from the variety's herbal side but this is cool vintage Cabernet."
Goodfellow,Pinot Gris,89.0,22.0,1,"This young vineyard is starting to make a name for itself with winemakers, and this 100% varietal wine demonstrates why. It's a classically Washington Merlot that shows appealing aromas of milk chocolate-covered raspberries. The feel is supple with sweet, luscious red fruit flavors that linger."
Goodfellow,Pinot Noir,90.33,41.33,6,"Half Syrah and half Cabernet Sauvignon, with 40% new French oak, this wine draws you in with its notes of blackberries, milk chocolate and anise. It's broad and fleshy in feel, with abundant coffee and cherry flavors backed by ample acidity."
Goose Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,15.0,1,"DTR is Domaine de la Terre Rouge's home site, planted in 1999, and its coolest. Given that, the aromas suggest more ripeness than would be expected, a heady mix of plum and brambly berry, with an undertone of minerality that keeps things zipping along."
Goose Ridge,Chardonnay,83.0,15.0,1,"This is a fully formed mouthful of a wine, meaty and smoky and brisk in savory fruit. From one of Terre Rouge's higher-elevation sites, it signals mountain fruit for sure, in terms of tannins and structure, but offers finesse in the glass, too."
Goose Ridge,Meritage,91.0,50.0,2,"An off-dry, organically farmed, 100%-varietal wine, this tiny production offering comes from an appellation better known for other varieties, but that shows finesse here. Fruity and balanced, the sweetness comes mostly in aromatic form, with a bouquet of pungent white flowers. Medium bodied, it shows an abundance of lithe fruit, finishing with a powerful kick of minerality."
Goose Ridge,Merlot,88.33,25.33,3,"Organically farmed grapes from an estate vineyard comprise this 100% varietal wine, another unusual offering from the Napa Valley. Dry, as advertised, it's fruity and medium bodied, with a taste of waxy apricot and melon."
Goose Ridge,Pinot Gris,85.33,16.67,3,"A white Meritage of just over 53% Sauvignon Blanc with the remainder Sémillon, aged in neutral French oak, this wine has a full body and a balance of crispness and weight. Lemon, lime, pear and honeydew melon highlight the aromas and flavors, finishing with length."
Goose Ridge,Red Blend,89.2,25.8,5,"This blend of 27% Mourvèdre, 23% Cinsault, 18% Counoise, 17% Grenache and 15% Syrah by the Fess Parker family shows cherry cola and concentrated plum on the nose. Blackberry and other purple fruits power the palate, with aromatic elderflower elements adding complexity."
Goose Ridge,Syrah,89.0,37.0,2,"Intense and earthy aromas of perfectly ripe berries, chocolate and a little natural funk in the form of mushroom. The highlight of this beauty is the cushy, plummy mouth, which is complex, cool and ultimately sublime. A real playboy of a Pinot, which opens up sensationally if given an hour's breathing. Only 116 cases made."
Goose Ridge,White Blend,86.33,18.0,3,"Wild roses and forest undergrowth wrap their persistent tendrils around ripe cherries and just a hint of toast on the nose of this complex and seductive offering. Finishes with enough structure to suggest trying again in a couple of years, once the midpalate has filled out."
Goose Watch,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,35.0,1,"Earth and cola notes accent a true Burgundian nose of rustic raspberry and herbs. This is a stylish, reserved wine—one that sits nicely on the palate and glides down smooth while still holding its cards tight to the vest. It should blossom and soften in about three or four years; now it has everything going for it."
Gordon Brothers,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,50.0,2,"An atypically oaky wine for Siduri, with a rich veneer of French oak overlying black cherries, cola and spice. The intensity builds on the palate, where root beer and black cherries culminate in a long, smoky-spicy finish. Needs a couple of years to pull itself together, but the raw materials are all there."
Gordon Brothers,Chardonnay,88.0,20.0,1,"Tree bark and pine needles mark the aromas, adding woodsy complexity and weight to ripe black cherries. Full and somewhat backward, this needs a few years to sort itself out and fully express its generous nature, but you can sense the future now in its power and velvety texture."
Gordon Brothers,Red Blend,91.0,30.0,1,"An ultrapure nose and tons of polish and precision define this tasty reserve-style blend of several vineyards. Pretty much an easy-drinker, with an undercurrent of sweet cherries and vanilla. It hits all chords and fades away smooth. Style and power come in proper proportions. Will age nicely for at least five years."
Gordon Brothers,Sauvignon Blanc,85.0,12.0,1,"Earthy and engaging, and a little bit rugged. Aromas of barnyard and Middle Eastern tahini set up a palate full of spiced-up curranty fruit. Light oak shows itself early in a finish that unfolds in layers, revealing complexity and class."
Gordon Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.25,38.0,4,"Zucca has made a fragrant and floral Sangiovese Rosato here, dry like cherry jam on toast and a nutty finish. Pair it with tropically seasoned seafood."
Gordon Estate,Chardonnay,88.67,28.0,3,"Cherry flavors turn a bit syrupy, with a sour cherry candy appeal. Acidic and slightly volatile, this tight, chewy wine spent 14 months in 40% new French oak barrels."
Gordon Estate,Gewürztraminer,92.0,35.0,1,"This is complex, delicious, bold and tannic, bringing the big structure that is expected without being heavy handed. It offers concentrated blackberry and fig aromas, richly jammy flavors that stay dry and a tannic but not tough texture."
Gordon Estate,Malbec,85.0,17.0,1,"This is an earthy, chalky wine, medium bodied and silky in wild strawberry, garden herb and fresh mint notes. From estate-grown Pinot, it is a balanced, accessible selection to drink now."
Gordon Estate,Merlot,88.29,26.86,7,"This 100% varietal wine, which saw 30 months of oak aging, is lightly aromatic with notes of cherry, anise, berry, vanilla and woodspice. It's quite restrained in feel—a very pretty wine—with elegant, sumptuous cherry flavors and a lingering finish."
Gordon Estate,Petit Verdot,89.0,30.0,1,"This wine is big, very full bodied and very lush in texture. Super-ripe in flavor, it rides at the place where plum notes segue to prune, and black cherry to cherry syrup, which is a very tasty place to be. Plenty of fine tannins frame all that concentration, yet the mouthfeel stays soft."
Gordon Estate,Red Blend,89.0,47.5,2,"This is complex and compelling. A spicy, minty, thyme-like character comes out in the aroma and continues in the flavor, most likely from some new barrels used in aging the wine. It's an attractive characteristic, and complements the bright cherry flavors, medium body and quite firm tannins."
Gordon Estate,Syrah,87.0,21.0,2,"This 100% varietal wine conveys notes of mortared green herbs, plum, cherry, medicine cabinet and vanilla. It's medium bodied with a supple, enticing feel. Baking spice, cherry and coffee flavors linger on the (very, very) long, coffee-filled finish. The aromas don't all come together but this wine is worth exploring for the remarkable finish, which is about as good as it gets."
Gordon Estate,Tempranillo,87.0,30.0,1,"Easy-drinking and intensely structured, this is marked by streaks of red raspberry fruit that also reveal cedar and herb. Slightly floral on the nose, the wine has a softness despite its size."
Gorman,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,28.0,1,"This is a light, bright, nearly clear bringing together of 51% Pinot Noir and 49% Chardonnay, just barely pink in color. It accentuates the beauty of both varieties, from Pinot's mix of cherry and watermelon to the Chardonnay's ability to bring out notions of crisp green apple."
Gorman,Cabernet Franc,91.0,80.0,1,"Syrah (37%), Grenache (24%) and Mourvèdre (19%) take the lead on this blend, with the balance Cinsault, Counoise, Cabernet and Viognier. Perfumed aromas of flowers, blue fruit and herbs lead to sweet, plentiful blue and black-fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end. The finish lingers."
Gorman,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.13,54.93,15,"Mourvèdre (42%) takes the lead on this blend followed by Syrah (38%) and Grenache. Oak aromas are initially in the lead, with notes of vanilla and barrel spice that are followed by lighter-styled cherry, cranberry and spice flavors. There's plenty to hold the interest."
Gorman,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,92.5,59.0,2,"From the heart of the Napa Valley, this opens in wafts of baked bread, cedar and herb, additionally exhibiting classical varietal notes like currant and pencil. Full bodied, round and ripe, it lingers in jolts of black pepper."
Gorman,Cabernet-Syrah,89.0,30.0,1,"A very pretty shade of pink, this blend of 89% Grenache and 11% Syrah shows crisp nectarine and peach, squeezed lime, fragrant honeydew, jasmine, strawberry ice cream, sweet onion and a green-mint twist on the dynamic nose. The palate is nicely tense, with lime rind leveling the riper peach, strawberry and watermelon flavors."
Gorman,Chardonnay,91.6,32.3,10,"This is a spicy, flavorful and fairly straightforward vineyard-designate. It's not overly complex, but offers a mix of classic Gravenstein-apple fruitiness with medium-bodied texture and weight."
Gorman,G-S-M,87.5,26.5,2,"Though reserved on the nose at first, this bottling begins to show dense blueberry, coffee and soy with patience. There are boisterous flavors of squeezed elderberry and blackberry fruit once sipped, along with beef char, black coffee, dark chocolate and purple flowers on the finish. This still needs a little time to open, but shows lots of potential."
Gorman,Gewürztraminer,88.0,28.0,2,"Delicate and detailed, this balanced Pinot Noir displays a perfect mix of wild berry, mushroom, green tea and a whiff of compost. These threads of flavor, and others associated with them, create a delightful tapestry that continues through the lengthy finish."
Gorman,Malbec,93.0,80.0,1,"This new designation from Rex Hill is a bit reticent aromatically, but full on the palate, with plummy fruit and a light hint of barnyard. Good texture and nicely threaded flavors roll onto the smooth, lingering finish."
Gorman,Red Blend,89.8,34.3,10,"Picked and vinified expressly for this rosé, the grapes were sourced from the Armada Vineyard. It has a pale, copper-like onion-skin shade, it is aged for a year longer than most rosés, but it has lost none of its freshness. The pretty strawberry note gains complexity and textural interest as it lingers on the palate. Persistent, focused, leesy and long, this elegant rosé looks deceptively light, but offers powerful flavors."
Gorman,Syrah,91.5,57.64,14,This light to medium-bodied wine follows initially earthy and metallic aromas with decent plum flavors. The aroma clears up with time and the wine's soft texture and fruitiness peek through.
Gorman,Syrah-Cabernet,93.0,60.0,1,"This lightly sweet and simple wine tastes straightforward, very fruity, soft in texture and light to medium in body."
Gorman,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,90.6,65.0,5,Rustic aromas like earth and dried leaves are followed by rather lean red-cherry and rhubarb flavors in this medium-bodied wine.
Gothic,Pinot Noir,85.0,24.0,1,"This is a simple, somewhat muted wine, with small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Sanguine, it shows a touch of red currant, cassis and cedar in addition to a burly full-bodied concentration of ripeness."
Gracianna,Chardonnay,86.0,36.0,2,"Bread-like, yeasty aromas adorn a simple thickness of smoky char, dark cherry and bold concentration in this wine, which seems heartier than the varietal tends to be."
Gracianna,Pinot Noir,87.25,57.5,4,Strong spicy meaty aromas and equally assertive oak and char flavors threaten to overwhelm the fruity aspects of this dry wine but it has enough concentration to match the firm tannins. Best after 2020.
Gracianna,Rosé,90.0,28.0,1,"This wine is soft and somewhat disjointed, uncertain of its structure. Highlights are caramel-toffee oak and a tease of anise amongst blackberry and black current."
Gracianna,Zinfandel,86.67,44.0,3,"The wines from this remote ranch off of Jalama Road combine mossy forest-floor touches with dark hearty aromas, in this case showing pine, rust, juniper, thyme and purple fruit on the nose. The texture is grippy, and there is cranberry fruit in the background, but the palate's attention turns mostly to eucalyptus, dark spice and even tobacco toward the finish."
Gramercy,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.8,67.0,5,"This blend of 64% Syrah, 26% Grenache and 10% Mourvèdre is unabashedly rich and lush, with cassis, vanilla, baked pastry, white chocolate, brown sugar and caramelized pork fat on the nose. Fudge, caramel and vanilla show powerfully on the sip, which will pair with a juicy steak or simply wow everyone at the table, even toward the end of a long night."
Gramercy,Mourvèdre,92.5,42.0,4,"This is a beautifully made, elegant wine that combines classic aromas of toasted bread, ripe apples and almonds with mouthfilling flavors of vanilla, lemon and cream while maintaining great balance from fresh acidity. A lingering finish echoes the spices and toast."
Gramercy,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.75,45.5,4,"Deep and hearty aromas of blackberry, candied violet and dried lavender are enhanced by a touch of roasted pork on the nose of this red by Adam Lee. The full-bodied palate is framed by soft yet structural tannins and a slow-rising acidity, showing dark berries, charred beef and a hint of licorice."
Gramercy,Rosé,88.0,25.0,1,"This bottling from a vineyard owned by the Fess Parker family is extremely gamy out of the gates, with raw lamb aromas lifted up by peppercorns and laid atop elderberry fruit. The lighter-bodied palate is framed by zesty acidity and a zippy pepper spice, with flavors of black currant and wild chaparral herbs."
Gramercy,Syrah,93.5,59.56,16,"This bottling from the famously rich wine-making vineyard shows incredible restraint on the nose, starting with the reserved aromas of lavender, white pepper, bergamot, pomegranate and snappy raspberry. The blackberry fruit runs quite deep on the sip, edged by bay leaf, menthol and purple flower touches. Simultaneously elegant and powerful."
Gramercy,Tempranillo,90.0,42.0,2,"Dark red cherry, crushed carnations, rose petals and a hint of nutmeg spice show on the nose of this bottling from an increasingly famous vineyard in this region. The palate's rich expression combines black plum, clove, red-cherry and mace flavors, bolstered by a fresh acidity."
Gramercy,Viognier,91.0,22.0,1,"Powerful, mouthwatering, concentrated black-cherry and blackberry flavors form the core of this full-bodied, full-flavored and well-balanced wine. Starting with aromas of toasted oak and wood smoke, the wine has a broad rich mouthfeel and moderate tannins that propel the gorgeous fruit flavors across the palate and linger a long time on the finish."
Grand Napa,Sparkling Blend,90.0,50.0,1,"All of the fruit for this wine comes from Monette's Vineyard in the Rocks District, and it was fermented using 75% whole clusters. The aromas are fresh and perfumed, recalling red raspberry, pipe tobacco, white pepper, pomegranate, kirsch, herb and orange peel. The palate shows mesmerizing purity in its red fruit flavors, which are backed by fine-grained tannins. A thoroughly delicious interpretation of the variety that is nothing short of dazzling."
Grand Rêve,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,45.0,1,"Aratás puts more bottle age on their Petite Sirah than most, and the extra maturity shows. Wonderful oak spices fill the aroma and extend into the fully ripe and richly fruity flavors of this big but beautifully sculpted wine. It has a lot of new oak influence and that is perfect to match the big body and monumental tannins that give the wine such impact."
Grand Rêve,Syrah,91.0,45.0,1,"Elegantly woven aromas of cassis, sandalwood and truffle show on the nose of this wine, which also includes 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc, 3% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. The palate also combines that plummy fruit with woody spice, showing cedar and crushed pepper, creating a savory experience that makes the mouth water into the finish."
Grandmaster,Meritage,86.0,14.0,1,"A firm and authoritative Bordeaux-style blend, the Squall Line is an equal mix of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with a splash of Merlot to finish. Cherry, plum and cassis fruit anchors the wine, with threads of graphite and roasted coffee running through a long, subtle, satisfying finish."
Grands Amis Winery,Petit Verdot,88.0,25.0,1,"This complement to the Lost Soul Syrah comes from the other end of the Yakima Valley, the Red Mountain vineyards of Klipsun and Ciel du Cheval. Cranberry and strawberry fruit shows good concentration. It's a compact wine with plenty of minerality from the vineyard sources, and an extended finish once it gets some breathing time."
Grands Amis Winery,Pinot Grigio,87.0,15.0,1,"This semi-sweet wine is dark in color, full bodied, peppery in aroma, and full of berry flavors on the palate. A thick texture coats the mouth with jammy sensations that slowly recede on the finish."
Grands Amis Winery,Zinfandel,84.0,20.0,1,Tart cranberry and raspberry fruit comes with a touch of caramel coffee. It's medium bodied and should be consumed within the next two or three years.
GrapeHeart Vineyards,Red Blend,85.0,69.0,1,"Cranberry fruit, sharp and tangy, is accented with darker notes of coffee. Tannins are earthy and finish slightly bitter."
Grassini,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,45.0,1,"Incredibly ripe and dried black cherry, strawberry, clove and smoke aromas give this bottling an almost port-like nose. The palate is similar, with prune and raisin touches, with cooked red fruit and baking spice."
Grassini,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,80.0,1,"This vineyard, and the AVA it occupies, is often characterized by some sharp metallic mineral-driven flavors. Here it seems just marginally ripe, with beet, black tea and metal dominating the astringent finish."
Grassini,Red Blend,91.5,40.0,2,"Finished at 185 g/L residual sugar, this is produced cryogenically (meaning frozen, then pressed). It's on the sugary side of sweet, with simple flavors of lemon tea and rock candy."
Grassini,Sauvignon Blanc,91.67,39.33,3,"Production is up and the price down on this joven-styled Tempranillo. Though labeled simply Oregon, it's Applegate Valley fruit, lightly aromatic with generic red-wine flavors. What elevates it is a strong sense of underlying minerality, that keeps the finish from tailing off immediately."
Graton Ridge,Pinot Noir,83.0,55.0,1,"Blackberry, cedar, peppercorn and herb aromas come through on the nose of this savory blend of 65% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dry and tart black plum skin flavor kicks off the palate, followed by potpourri, lavender and pine notes."
Gravel Bar,Red Blend,88.0,20.0,2,"Tart and fruity, this mixes strawberry and citrus flavors. There is some indication of stem contact, and the tannins have some grip to them. Drink now through 2020."
Graveyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,50.0,1,"Deep, saturated color and chocolate-covered cherry flavor make this wine a treat to drink, but don't expect a traditional dry dinner wine. It's turbocharged with sweetness and has a boisterous but agreeable personality."
Graveyard,Petite Sirah,86.0,60.0,1,"As with the other single-vineyard wines from Brooks, this was give 18 months in French oak, and shows strong accents of baking spices and plum cake. The fruit leans toward raisins and figs—just on the edge of overripe—and continues into a finish with vanilla wafer and macaroons. There's a lot going on, but it has not (yet) knit together."
Graveyard,Red Blend,87.0,35.0,2,"Flavors of plum, cherry, cassis, chalky earth, smoke and bell pepper. Still tight and chewy, with suggestions that the fruit from this difficult vintage didn’t attain full ripeness. A good effort from a subpar year, marked by a hint of brett on the finish."
Graveyard,Rosé,85.0,18.0,1,"Yellow in color and thick in the bouquet. The nose is hard to peg, but there are notes of mustard and asparagus. The palate offers some orange and apple flavors, but also something similar to canned peas. It seems overripe and past its prime."
Graveyard,Syrah,88.0,50.0,1,"Blue fruit and high acidity open this delightful Pinot Noir, from a cool section of the Russian River Valley overlapping Green Valley. The oak imprint is low, yet the wine offers firm structure and elegance, remaining subdued and fresh on the palate in swirls of dark cherry, boysenberry and earthy leather."
Graveyard,Zinfandel,88.75,35.5,4,"There is an insane amount of power in this wine, sourced from the mighty Bedrock, where the Zin is interplanted with Petite Sirah and Alicante Bouschet. Blueberry, candied orange and rosemary complement one another, while a dustiness and minerality play tricks on the tongue, testifying about the vineyard's rocky soils."
Grayson,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,11.0,1,"From a famed old site planted to 75% Zinfandel and 25% mixed black-skinned varieties, this wine conveys a minty-eucalyptus quality that tunes the acidity high against a medium-weight body. Austere at first on the palate, it expands as it goes, offering robust, dry tannins and layers of cardamom and coffee with time and air."
Grayson,Chardonnay,87.0,11.0,3,"There's an intensity of cola-cinnamon spice and clove within the aromas and flavors of this single-vineyard designate, intriguing invites to explore further. Pure, crisp and focused raspberry and earth follow, with a subtle use of oak that allows the fruit and varietal exoticness to speak."
Grayson,Merlot,85.5,11.0,2,"This Cab-based blend sources 51% of its grapes from Sonoma County, including small amounts of Merlot, Petite Verdot, Malbec, Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Franc. Medium in weight, the wine at first is slightly muted, but upon opening it provides Syrah-like meatiness and peppery spice around an intriguingly brooding sense of tar and black currant."
Grayson,Pinot Noir,86.0,13.0,1,"Robust, dense and meaty, this 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot dances around well-concocted swirls of black tea, herb and cedar. Soft and smooth on the palate, the oak is subtle, coaxing out flavors of tobacco and black currant, finishing with purpose."
Green & Red,Zinfandel,89.0,22.0,1,"The winery blends 84% Cabernet Sauvignon with 11% Petit Verdot and 5% Malbec for this high-end red. Burly in tobacco and cedar, it also offers a floral, high-toned spirit built around juicy cranberry on the palate. With well-integrated tannins and oak, it finishes in a note of bittersweet chocolate."
Greenwood Ridge,Zinfandel,88.33,27.67,3,"Coming from a vineyard that sits 500 feet above Monterey Bay, this shows crisp green apple and grapefruit rinds on the nose, as well as a sharp, intriguing herbal tinge. It's extremely tight and high-toned on the palate, with bitter lime peels, white rocks and salinity, finishing on toasted apples."
Gregory Graham,Chardonnay,86.0,30.0,2,"Fermented with 35% stems and aged in neutral French oak, this 100% varietal wine brings both hedonistic and intellectual enjoyment. Lighter in color, it offers intriguing notes of flowers, mineral, dried herbs and red and blue fruit. The elegantly styled, creamy flavors suggest smoke and mineral, with an appealing sultry feel."
Gresser,Chardonnay,87.0,18.0,1,"This is ripe and pungent, a rich and fruit-driven mix of fig, peach and melon. There are interesting herbal highlights, and more acidity than in the past. The thyme and rosemary streak continues into and through the finish, while the fruit maintains its power and polish, with just the lightest barrel influence perceptible in a kiss of toast."
Gresser,Pinot Noir,86.0,32.0,2,"The second of three Syrahs from Betz, this is thick and dark, heavy with still-chewy tannins, this rich and compact wine needs more time in bottle. It's done in a big, toasty style, with lush black cherry fruit set against smoky, chewy tannins. It has a lot of power, but in its current (quite youthful) stage of development it remains stubbornly tight, herbal and hard. Give it plenty of breathing and/or cellar time."
Gresser,Red Blend,86.0,20.0,1,"The blend is 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 42% Merlot, 11% Syrah and a splash of Cab Franc. This is nicely sculpted, with the typical plush midpalate, matching crisp red berries to butterfat. The fruit is sleek and has an underpinning of mineral and accents of fennel. Though the alcohol tops out at a hefty 14.7%, the fruit can handle it."
Gresser,Riesling,88.0,18.0,1,"This elegant effort is 46% Cab Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 18% Cab Franc; still wrapped up tight and showing tart cassis and berry fruit. There is a lot of the classic Ciel minerality underlying the fruit, with hard tannins and lightly peppery herbal details. At just 14.1% alcohol, this is a classic example of how Washington brings bright New World fruit and terroir to a style that retains the elegance of the Old World."
Gresser,Sparkling Blend,82.0,25.0,1,"It is amazing that 134,000 cases of this budget bottling can be made to this level of quality. From a classic vintage, it's structured and substantial, overcoming the somewhat overdone vanilla flavors with great fruit and firm acids."
Grevino,Chardonnay,90.0,50.0,1,This wine is equal parts Viognier and Roussanne. It offers light aromas of peach and apricot that are followed by full-bodied flavors that show some warmth and bitterness on the finish.
Grevino,Dolcetto,88.0,75.0,1,"Attractive floral aromas and bright cherry and raspberry flavors make a light, refreshing impression. This medium-bodied wine has light tannins and lively acidity in the texture."
Grevino,Pinot Noir,93.0,75.0,1,"A sharp, acidic, tight, precisely-defined Syrah with cranberry and sour cherry fruit. This wine has the potential for years of aging; even after being open for many hours, the sharp acids and primary fruit flavors remained, along with inviting suggestions of soy and composted earth. If you are not going to cellar it, decanting is mandatory."
Grevino,Riesling,88.0,40.0,1,"A blended red from Sparkman, sharp and tannic, with good concentration. Tart, spicy and herbal, with hints of tomato and wild berry. It rolls into an astringent finish, with a dark chocolate note."
Grevino,Syrah,87.0,55.0,1,"With buttered popcorn scents and flavors, underscored with pretty, toasty oak, this marries those flavors to a more restrained body, balanced with good acidity and showing fruit flavors of green apple and banana cream pie. Not a complex wine, but forward and flavorful."
Grey Stack,Chardonnay,92.0,40.0,2,"Fresh, spicy and crisp, this deft Malbec shines with pretty raspberry fruit and sharp acidity. Focused and clean, it's a big step forward for this winery."
Grey Stack,Pinot Noir,90.0,50.0,1,"Pepper and black fruits comprise this pure Petite Sirah from one of Washington's warmest AVAs. Underscored with herb and earth, it is a far cry from the jammy monsters of California, but nicely made in a light and elegant style."
Grey Stack,Sauvignon Blanc,91.5,30.0,2,"Quite firm and focused, with a dominating scent of cut tobacco. The black cherry fruit is set against juicy acids, and rolls into a finish with streaks of licorice and more of that cut tobacco flavor."
Grey Wolf Cellars,Grenache,91.0,32.0,2,"This reserve-level Pinot from DDO is exceptional in every way. Silky, elegant and deeply-fruited, it marries a plush midpalate of red berries and cherries to compelling grace notes of pine needle, cola and mocha. Delicious and ageworthy; if past vintages are any indication, this can go until 2029."
Grey Wolf Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,36.0,1,"Generous in brambly wild raspberry fruit and leather, this lush bottling has peppery spice to spare. Aromatically it's as fine as perfume, floral and pretty; in texture, it's soft, but with just the right tension and electricity. Savory and spicy, it will bring out similar characteristics at the table."
Grey Wolf Cellars,Rhône-style White Blend,92.0,24.0,1,"The 30-year-old vines at Canary Hill seem to have ripened well at lower brix, yielding a full-flavored, forward wine with lovely plum and cherry fruit. There also are pleasing details of leaf and cured meat, in a wine that keeps on giving the more you look."
Grey Wolf Cellars,Rosé,88.0,22.0,2,"A spine of steel runs through the core of this wine, supporting spicy fruit flavors of cranberry, pomegranate and raspberry. Details of black tea contribute to the length, while the balanced tannins and underlying minerality give it still more structural support."
Grey Wolf Cellars,Syrah,91.0,34.0,1,"Exceptionally fragrant, it sends up scents of white peaches and hazelnuts. Savory highlights adorn the crisp, detailed fruit flavors of peach, pear and yellow apples."
Greyscale,Sauvignon Blanc,85.0,34.0,1,"This single block selection is a truly pretty wine, with scents and flavors of rose petals, raspberries, brown spices, nutmeg and mocha. It's complex and elegant, with a mouth-pleasing creaminess."
Grgich Hills,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,101.75,8,"Darker and more brooding than many of Newsome-Harlow's other single-vineyard bottlings in the 2011 vintage, the Shake Ridge is mighty in black pepper and dark chocolate, silky and voluptuous with mellowed tannins. Blended with 8% Petite Sirah, the ranch's Zin clones include Monte Rosso."
Grgich Hills,Chardonnay,89.3,68.8,10,"This vineyard designate, showcasing the oldest vines from the oldest vineyard in the Walla Walla Valley, piles on the details of earth, grape and barrel. There's cassis, blackberry and fig in generously layered profusion, along with substantial components of dried herbs, cedar and pipe tobacco. The exceptional complexity, balance and length make this a sure-fire candidate for cellaring until 2024 or more."
Grgich Hills,Fumé Blanc,89.0,30.5,2,"Light in color, this delicate wine is herbal and yet bright in Bing cherry, quite nuanced and slight at first, unveiling its concentration and complexity slowly and seductively over time. Made by longtime grape growers, the acidity is lively and the weight slim, traces of restrained oak and garden herb dancing in the background. Only 54 cases made."
Grgich Hills,Merlot,88.33,42.33,3,"These “Original Vines” are in fact the oldest Pinot Gris vines in the country. They deliver exquisite details of earth and stone around a solid core of apple and Asian pear. It's bone dry, with exceptional depth."
Grgich Hills,Petit Verdot,91.0,65.0,1,"Blending distinction with sheer pleasure, the bouquet opens with scents of green, black, and Kalamata olives, sage, forest floor and slate. Those aromas translate remarkably to the palate, which is a potpourri of dried herbs and wet earth. There are barely any overt fruit characteristics, and the savory, sophisticated result is simply delicious."
Grgich Hills,Petite Sirah,90.0,65.0,2,"Aged seven years in French oak, this is made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then fortified with six-year-old, barrel-aged Cabernet Franc brandy. Very little is made. The experience is stellar, the dark-brown-red-hued wine opulent in red candy apple, chocolate and raspberries with ample acidity and a nuttiness to the finish. The pairing suggestion of a cigar is exactly right, though the wine will dance with nuts and cheeses or a decadent cheesecake too."
Grgich Hills,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,55.0,3,"A consistent standout among Newsome-Harlow's stellar lineup of single-vineyard Zins, The Donner Party is rich in blackberry liqueur and licorice, finely structured and soft in tannins, with a dusty, mocha-lined finish and just the right seasoning of leather. Blended with 12% Petite Sirah."
Grgich Hills,White Blend,91.0,85.0,1,"Essentially Scott Paul's reserve, this is sourced entirely from biodynamically-farmed, 40-year-old vines at the Maresh vineyard. The Audrey layers cherry fruit with streaks of mineral, and carries plenty of underlying acidity. The wine manages to feel full-bodied without losing a sense of elegant proportion."
Grgich Hills,Zinfandel,89.0,35.5,2,"A candied-cherry nose meets with cinnamon stick, nutmeg and turned earth on the nose of this blend of 78% Grenache, 18% Syrah and 4% Mourvèdre. Dried strawberry and dark cranberry show once sipped, with sweet tar, fennel, hibiscus and concentrated cola flavors."
Grieve,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,45.0,1,"Matchstick and flint arise out of the bottle before blowing off to show off a mix of herb and jalapeño around a well-oaked, robust white wine. The stronger, more savory characteristics evolve pleasantly into a fresher, rounder taste of tangerine that provides a freshness to the finish."
Griffin Creek,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,60.0,1,"Graceful acidity balances the big flavor and salty oak of this wine, awash in bite-worthy green apple, tart quince and lemon. The body is medium but expertly textured, providing intense length and weight on the finish."
Griffin Creek,Red Blend,84.0,60.0,1,"A vibrant, racy Sauvignon Blanc with concentrated notes of white grapefruit, herbs, and onion peel. It's mouthwatering and richly flavored with mineral notes speckling the finish."
Grimm's Bluff,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.67,68.67,3,"From 62-year-old, dry-farmed vines, the Esola Zinfandel is leathery, full of tobacco and dust surrounded by spicy red fruit. With great structure and savoriness, it's soft with a light, lingering finish and will develop further with grace another 5–7 years."
Grimm's Bluff,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,48.0,1,"Blended with 20% Petit Verdot, this unusual offering brings notes of mushroom, herbs, smoke and dark cherries. It's tightly wound with a firm squeeze of tannins."
Grindstone,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,18.0,1,"This wine is big, very full bodied and very lush in texture. Super-ripe in flavor, it rides at the place where plum notes segue to prune, and black cherry to cherry syrup, which is a very tasty place to be. Plenty of fine tannins frame all that concentration, yet the mouthfeel stays soft."
Grindstone,Red Blend,88.0,16.0,1,"This is complex and compelling. A spicy, minty, thyme-like character comes out in the aroma and continues in the flavor, most likely from some new barrels used in aging the wine. It's an attractive characteristic, and complements the bright cherry flavors, medium body and quite firm tannins."
Grizzly Peak,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.5,28.0,2,"This 100% varietal wine conveys notes of mortared green herbs, plum, cherry, medicine cabinet and vanilla. It's medium bodied with a supple, enticing feel. Baking spice, cherry and coffee flavors linger on the (very, very) long, coffee-filled finish. The aromas don't all come together but this wine is worth exploring for the remarkable finish, which is about as good as it gets."
Grizzly Peak,Malbec,88.0,35.0,2,"Easy-drinking and intensely structured, this is marked by streaks of red raspberry fruit that also reveal cedar and herb. Slightly floral on the nose, the wine has a softness despite its size."
Grochau,Pinot Noir,84.0,36.0,1,"An aromatically subtle wine with notes of mortared herbs, flowers and cherry. The fruit flavors are elegantly styled, broadening with time, with a slightly gritty feel to the tannins but with a long finish."
Gros Ventre,Pinot Noir,92.0,56.0,5,"A blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 15% Malbec and 10% Petit Verdot, this reflects a pleasing mixture of each, with notes of blackberry, raspberry, plum and fresh herbs. Fruit flavors are plush and up front backed by chewy tannins."
Groth,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,130.0,2,"This is a rare, single-vineyard, 100% varietal wine from Red Mountain where Bordeaux varieties reign. It brings appealing accents of tart cherries and assorted barrel spices, including clove and vanilla. Flavors are medium bodied with a pleasing blast of tart acidity. Vanilla flavors speckle the finish."
Groth,Chardonnay,90.0,30.0,5,"This is a dry, richly flavored and well-structured wine. A complex, spicy, earthy, cherrylike bouquet accompanies saturated flavors of currant, black cherry and pomegranate spiced with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. It's not too full bodied and has good balance that comes from firm acidity and tannins."
Grow Wines,Chardonnay,93.0,38.0,1,"A well-made relatively large production Cabernet, fruity in black cherry with a smoky edge of cinnamon toast and soft vanilla. Pour at your next party."
Guarachi Family,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.0,50.0,1,"There's a lot going on here with notes of orange peel, fruit compote, flowers, and chocolate. It's lighter in style, showing the elegance of the 2011 vintage, with tart fruit flavors and a tacky feel to the tannins"
Guarachi Family,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,250.0,1,"Hints of tropical fresh fuit and flowers lends an exotic touch to this pretty wine, and on the palate, it offers balanced elements of crisp fruit and spicy oak. Not terribly complex but a friendly food wine."
Guarachi Family,Pinot Noir,92.29,75.0,7,"A light floral and toasty nose leads into this clean, slightly racy Chardonnay from New York. There's a touch of sweetness to the wine but it's balanced by good oak and an earthiness to the finish."
Guardian,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.57,38.14,7,"A very appealing nose of earthy spice starts this successful Chard, and leads into a full, rounded blanket of toasted oak and fruit. There's complexity here without heaviness, and the wine finishes big but pretty. Pair with richer seafood—like crab—or creamy poultry dishes."
Guardian,Cabernet Franc,88.0,21.0,1,"Barrel fermented and aged on the lees for almost a year, this is a nutty, slightly oily wine that shows the influence of the barrel, but lacks the fruit density to match it. The 14% alcohol hits the palate with some heat. High-toned and a bit harsh."
Guardian,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.75,41.0,4,"Not much of this wine was made, the grapes coming from a vineyard in the heart of the appellation farmed by Phil Coturri. Earthy and light in oak, it struggles to show fruit, remaining more about minerally and compostable aromas."
Guardian,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,90.0,37.0,1,"This wine is dark, sweet and slightly effervescent in texture. It has an inky color, aromas like Concord-grape juice and roses, and jammy flavors."
Guardian,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,91.0,37.0,1,"This light-bodied and lightly sweet sparkling wine is light blue in color, has a very fruity flavor and rather soft mouthfeel despite the frothy bubbles."
Guardian,Chardonnay,86.67,22.0,3,"The peachy color of this bubbly wine is appropriate because the aromas and flavors are effusively peachy, too. It is light bodied, very sweet and has been flavored with something other than grapes."
Guardian,Malbec,87.0,18.0,1,"Don Lorenzi is making a strong case for growing cool climate-loving Chardonnay in the hot Temecula Valley. This clonal study delivers honeysuckle, marzipan and lemon curd aromas, while the palate offers richer notes of buttered apple and poached pear. Although ripe in style, it's cut by a zesty lemon-like acidity."
Guardian,Merlot,89.33,33.0,3,"Pinot-phile Brian Loring lends his deeply extracted style to this Rhône grape, delivering concentrated blueberry, black plum, dark chocolate and mint aromas. The palate is hearty, with mint chocolate chip ice cream, eucalyptus, fennel and ripe black cherry flavors."
Guardian,Petite Sirah,87.0,21.0,1,"This wine has a pretty honeysuckle aroma that invites from beginning to end, its silky texture met with moderate acidity along the way. Medium bodied and creamy, it offers additional layers of white peach and almond."
Guardian,Red Blend,89.14,26.29,7,"Released three years ago, this is drinking at or near its peak. The fruit remains lush, with herbal threads tied throughout, and a pleasing scent and streak of tobacco. Black-cherry flavors push into velvety tannins, with a finishing touch of licorice."
Guardian,Sauvignon Blanc,90.33,20.0,3,"Dusty plum flavors meet baked bread aromas in this tightly-wound, tense vineyard-designated wine. It's marked by an undercurrent of pomegranate and rhubarb, the texture taking on more savory tones of forest and black tea as it finishes."
Guardian,Syrah,91.0,30.0,3,"A waft of freshly baked baguette unfurls on the nose of this wine, followed by sautéed mushroom scents, giving it earthy character. Soft and round on the palate, the fruit tends toward darker, lusher notes of blueberry and plum."
Guenoc,Claret,90.0,18.0,1,"Creamy on the nose with a scent of musk and flowers, this wine from Brotherhood is too angular to fully enjoy. The acidity is good but the overall flavors are lean."
Guglielmo,Carignane,85.0,20.0,1,"Fermented to a plus-size 15.4% alcohol, this rare wine from one of Washington's oldest and best Cabernet vineyards shows what a gifted winemaker can do with great fruit. The play of flavors, mixing red and purple fruits, toasted nuts, mocha, caramel, bark and earth, is exceptional. The detail is extraordinary for a wine with such high alcohol. The acids and tannins are seamless and fine, and the flavors extend into an unusual finish that suggests menthol and eucalyptus – not generally a character found in Champoux fruit. All in all it's a wonderful voyage, and one of a handful of essential Washington wines."
Guglielmo,Charbono,85.0,25.0,1,"Eola-Amity Hills has a distinctive “voice” in the newly-defined Willamette Valley AVAs. It brings in earth and herb in a round and integrated style, not abrasive or stemmy, but adding Burgundy-like notes to the essential Pinot Noir character. The fruit is light and mixes cherry and citrus, and the tannins are proportionate and supple."
Guglielmo,Petite Sirah,90.0,25.0,1,"A beautiful, bargain-priced blend of Tinta Roriz (aka Tempranillo), Touriga Nacional, Touriga Francesa and Alvarelhão. Violet and jasmine perfumed, this wine is so, so pretty with just a stunning nose. In taste, there's raspberry, strawberry and lilting layers of pepper and herbs. An intriguing wine well worth trying, made by Morgan Winery Winegrower Dan Lee."
Gundlach Bundschu,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,40.0,4,"Tightly wound, but clearly big and bold with massive tannins, this Tempranillo has amazingly dark, brooding fruit and spicy undertones and should develop into a stunner with time."
Gundlach Bundschu,Chardonnay,91.67,27.0,3,"Though just 12% alcohol, this wine is ripe and vibrant, with a thrilling bouquet of violets, cranberries and fresh herbs. Light and delicate, perfectly balanced and complex, with a whiff of chocolate in the finish."
Gundlach Bundschu,Gewürztraminer,91.33,23.33,3,"A soft, feminine nose of toasted oak and round fruit on the nose, and a flavor profile of balanced fruit and acid on the palate, make this a good white for both cold weather, serious meals and just sipping on the patio in warmer months. The mouthfeel is a touch light and the wine could use some weight, but overall, a good choice for numerous dishes."
Gundlach Bundschu,Pinot Noir,89.5,38.0,2,"A rush of zippy, fresh fruit and spice aromas recommends this white from New York, offering the kind of clean fruit flavors and minerality that makes this region unique. The wine lacks real complexity and tends toward the austere but the beguiling spice saves the day."
Gustafson Family,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,38.0,1,"A light, subtle nose is followed by simple but elegant Chardonnay flavors and a successful play of oak and acid. The mouthfeel is equally appealing, round and supple. The wine could use more complexity but overall, is enjoyable and will be good with a variety of richer poultry and seafood dishes."
Gustafson Family,Petite Sirah,92.67,28.0,3,"This is a sharp, high-toned Cabernet, which begins with nail polishy aromas and some cherry candy flavors, then quickly tails off. It lacks both depth and detail, making it difficult to understand what merits the reserve designation."
Gustafson Family,Riesling,91.0,20.0,1,"Golden caramel in color, this wine opens in a decadence of creme brûlée, a richness that subsides on the lighter style on the palate, marked by a saltiness of wet stone, pineapple and vanilla oak. Together, the light and heavy balance one another and the wine tastes complete."
Gustafson Family,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,22.0,1,"Cherry, berry and sinewy leather make for a memorable experience of fruit and savory accents in this farm-designate that impresses from start to finish. Offering length and breadth, it's balanced despite noticeable ripeness and body."
Gustafson Family,Syrah,88.33,24.0,3,"Soft, juicy acidity and texture buoy this wine in wonderful ways, providing a lithe foundation to punches of sassafras and truffled earth. Sourced from the famous vineyard on Westside Road in the northern reaches of the appellation, it shows off a flair of pine along with dark cherry."
Gustafson Family,Zinfandel,83.0,28.0,2,"The producer's original source of Chardonnay, Sangiacomo grapes have figured into this wine since 1987, this vintage of which is astounding in tropical, fleshy layers of elegance, flecks of freshly cut pear providing further succulence. Richly textured, it's balanced while robust."
Guyomar,Red Blend,89.33,45.33,3,"Here is a bold, striking wine from the estate vineyard. Black cherries capture the core flavor of the Dundee Hills AVA, with substantial, somewhat grainy tannins. Highlights of coffee grounds add another dark note. Pair this with a thick, wild-caught salmon steak."
Guyomar,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,42.0,2,"A light imprint marks this high-toned wine, expressive in crisp green apple, citrus and stone. Fresh in lemony acidity, it builds up to a medium body in the glass, offering impressive complexity and refreshment."
Gypsy Canyon,Mission,96.0,150.0,1,"This is a hearty version of the variety for this producer, known for its oft-lighter approach. It reveals skill as well, the grapes from another prime site overseen by brand partner Bill Price. A feral shock of mushroom dominates on the nose before punchy tannins and a medium-body distract slightly in contoured texture, only barely letting in crisp flavors of orange peel and dark cherry."
Gypsy Canyon,Pinot Noir,93.0,95.0,1,"Intricate, jammy aromas of black cherry, blackberry, flowers, spice and mineral lead to plentiful black-fruit flavors. It shows the warmth of the vintage while bringing an undeniable sense of deliciousness, with lip smacking tannins backing it up."
Gypsy Dancer,Pinot Gris,86.0,25.0,1,"This wine is a blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc, 11% Merlot, 3% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot. It opens with intriguing aromas of graphite, cherry, barrel spice, garden herbs, coffee grounds and dark fruit. The flavors are pitch black and generous, showing density and layering."
Gypsy Dancer,Pinot Noir,89.4,60.2,5,"There's a lot to admire in this producer's entry-level wine in terms of price and complexity, a blend of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon with 25% Merlot and 1% each of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Syrah. Burnt wood and herb underlie full-bodied, sizable waves of black-fruit flavor, graphite, tar and coffee."
Gård,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,42.4,5,"Right Bank employs 72% Cabernet Franc to make a statement, accenting it with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Malbec, 3% Merlot and 1% Petit Verdot. Herbal and pretty, this full-bodied wine remains tight in its youth, the tannins firm and powerful, barely letting in the mouthful of red cherry that awaits. Drink now through 2021."
Gård,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,87.0,22.0,1,"This wine is a mix of fruit from Anna Marie and McClellan Estate vineyards. The aromas offer notes of dark roasted coffee, vanilla, herbs, spice and cherry, with the barrel notes initially at the fore. The palate is textured and supple, with the feel and flavors keeping the attention high."
Gård,Malbec,89.0,30.0,2,"Sauvage aromas of forest dominate on the nose of this well-made wine, showing off intriguing notes of clove, black tea and sarsaparilla before unleashing a velvet carpet's worth of cherry and cranberry. Spicy and savory are the coins of the realm here, with bright acidity underlying it all."
Gård,Pinot Gris,87.4,18.4,5,"Toasty wood and crisp lemon complement one another in this medium-bodied, richly layered and developed wine, complex in green apple and nutmeg. There's lovely structure behind this wine as well, making for a food-friendly pairing that should age well in bottle another couple of years."
Gård,Red Blend,88.83,26.0,6,"Campfire smoke and meat rise on the nose of this 100% varietal wine, a nearly rustic experience if it weren't for the powerful beauty behind the rest of the story. A soft, dry grip of tannin plays against youthfully ripe notions of blackberry jam on toast, with chocolate and cigar lurking in the background. Drink now through 2023."
Gård,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.5,34.0,2,"Petit Verdot (62%) takes the lead on this blend, followed by Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. The flower, green herb, coffee and barrel spice aromas are brooding, while the palate offers bright acids, firm tannins and a spot-on sense of balance."
Gård,Riesling,89.33,18.83,6,"There's plenty of nuance to enjoy, with aromas of exotic spice, flowers, raspberry, orange peel and huckleberry, showing more on each swirl. The palate is polished and flavorful, showing a masterful touch."
Gård,Rosé,88.0,25.8,5,"From one of the few vineyards in Santa Barbara County to grow this grape, this bottling plays to the savory side. White pepper and raw beef show alongside tight and tart boysenberry fruit. Wild-berry flavors on the sip meet with dried sagebrush, thyme and potpourri elements."
Gård,Roussanne,86.0,18.0,2,"Made by David Ramey, this blend of 80% Zinfandel, 11% Alicante and 9% Petite Sirah impresses in its fruit-forward approachability and all-around likability. Earthy, it teases in dark cherry, vanilla and milk-chocolate flavors, the texture smoothly etched in fine leather."
Gård,Syrah,92.0,47.0,5,"This bottling from a vineyard west of the Sta. Rita Hills by David and Anna deLaski explores the lower ripeness, exotically spiced range of Pinot Noir. Aromas of tart boysenberry, sour hibiscus, sumac and white pepper show on the nose. The palate picks up a bit more viscosity to deliver cranberry, Kalamata olive and cardamom flavors."
Gård,Viognier,87.5,22.0,2,"Grüner Veltliner is an extreme rarity in the state. Sparkling offerings? Unheard of. This one brings appealing aromas of lime pith, white pepper, autolytic notes and citrus. The palate brings a big blast of acid, drinking quite dry. The acid is intense on its own but it will fit in nicely at the dinner table."
Gård,Viognier-Roussanne,89.0,14.0,1,"Pale peach in color, the aromas bring bright notes of passion fruit, guava and strawberry. It drinks dry, but with plenty of kiwi and other tropical-fruit flavors bringing a sense of sweetness. Distinctly fruit forward for a rosé, it delivers a lot of appeal, despite occasionally seeming a bit weighty."
Gård,White Blend,87.0,14.0,1,"This is the first Chenin Blanc from this up-and-coming winery. All native yeast fermented and aged in stainless steel, the aromas pop, with notes of pear, apple, lees and melon. Sleek in style, it brings a sense of brightness and purity of flavor and bright acids. Very varietally correct, it's a compelling example of Chenin in the state. Pair it with food to see it at its best."
H Mynors,Zinfandel,89.0,22.0,1,"Clean and crisp lines of sea salt and lemon zest meet with caramelized white peach and pear on the nose of this bottling from the Foley family. The palate's chalky texture delivers richer flavors of baked yellow pears, cinnamon and baking spice."
Hahn,Chardonnay,90.0,25.0,5,"Deep aromas of kirsch, ginger snaps and leather show on the nose of this ripe and hearty bottling from a vineyard named for the geographic feature that allows ocean air to cool down this region. Dried cherries, clove and star anise show on the palate, which is framed by firm tannins and cut by a steady but not overpowering acidity."
Hahn,G-S-M,89.0,45.0,1,"This unique project focuses on one single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon each year. Aromas of vanilla bean and other barrel spices are at the fore at present, with dark fruit lurking in the background. The plum and black-currant flavors are lush and full, showing a bit of warmth on the finish. The oak influence is primary at present but it has good stuffing."
Hahn,Grenache,90.0,30.0,1,"Topped with 18% Malbec, aromas of wood spice, vanilla, pencil lead and dark cherry lead to juicy full-bodied dark-fruit flavors that show a lovely sense of balance, despite the wood being forward. It's a very pretty expression of Cabernet."
Hahn,Pinot Gris,88.0,28.0,2,"With 20% Pinot Gris in the mix and a percentage of French oak-aging, this white is thirst-quenching and medium bodied, expressive in grassy pea shoots and apricot. On the palate, it offers texture and fruit-forward likability, finishing in crisp pear."
Hahn,Pinot Noir,90.8,42.0,5,"Temecula vintner Phil Baily is one of this warmer region's strongest proponents for upholding complexity over ripeness. This bottling offers red currant, cedar, leather and minty chocolate on the nose, while the palate conveys lots of herbal influence, from peppercorn, licorice and dill to minty black raspberry and eucalyptus oil. All those elements need more time to integrate. Drink 2019–2023."
Haka by Labyrinth,Red Blend,89.0,22.0,1,"Dark reddish-orange in color, this medium-bodied rosé offers refreshing acidity against a dramatic backdrop of intensely etched flavors, a mix of dark cherry, strawberry and blood orange that refreshes and rewards."
Halcon,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,32.0,1,"This wine is 76% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 9% Grenache. Aromas of black fruit, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, raw meat and spice are followed by smooth black-coffee flavors. It lingers on the finish."
Halcon,Syrah,92.0,32.0,2,"White peach and honey-butter aromas show on the nose of this richly styled bottling from one of the region's bigger producers. Salt and nectarine appear strongly on the palate, which is bound together by a very grippy texture. Waves of caramel pop toward the finish."
Halcyon,Cabernet Franc,90.0,39.0,1,"This blends 84% Merlot, 11% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot, the three varieties combining to full-bodied effect. Earthy in mushroom and cedar, its texture is leathery, with the palate dotted in tobacco and black pepper, the character savory and full of spice."
Hall,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.59,158.53,17,"One hundred percent varietal, this vineyard designated Merlot seems a casualty of the cool 2010 growing season with prominent herbal notes, tart plum flavors, and astringent tannins."
Hall,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,32.5,2,"Big, round and lush, this is the fourth vintage for this wine, one of the best Chardonnays in Washington state. In this vintage it did not go through full malolactic, leaving a nice underlying acidity with a leesy, creamy freshness. Golden apples, stone fruits and a lick of butterscotch add to the luscious, generous finish."
Halleck,Gewürztraminer,89.0,35.0,1,"There's a streak of citrus running down the spine. The lively acidity adds some zip to the blackberry and black cherry fruit. There's a smoky edge to the polished tannins, but those lemony acids keep the wine bright and fresh, penetrating into a lingering finish with sweet cracker and pepper highlights."
Halleck,Pinot Noir,86.25,57.0,4,"A lush mouthful of nuanced fruit, this single-vineyard Viognier is loaded with a rich mix of peach, apricot, papaya and guava fruit. Laced into the hefty fruit core are baking spices and cocoa powder, along with suggestions of curry and cumin. This wine should be mandatory with curry dishes."
Halleck,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,35.0,1,"Some richness and heft separate this wine from the pack, as it carries ripe white cherry and peach flavors on its soft but just-crisp-enough texture. Its medium to full body gives it a mouth-filling presence."
Halter Ranch,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,55.0,1,"This young release carries strong scents and flavors of cranberry, along with the sharp acidic attack that implies, which qualifies it as a good choice for many fatty dishes. It's rather simple, fruity, with no hint of new oak. Drink up while it's young and fresh."
Halter Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,35.0,1,"Tempranillo has become a mainstay red grape in southern Oregon, but it's a rarity further north. Light toasty fruit flavors suggest tart raspberry with a hint of wood from 14 months in 20% new American oak barrels. The low alcohol and high acid suggest that this wine should be consumed over the next two or three years."
Halter Ranch,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,32.0,1,"Boysenberry aromas and blackberry jam flavors fill this Bordeaux-style red blend to the brim, while a smooth texture and touch of sweetness make it an easy sipper. A great pairing for spicy Korean barbecue."
Hamacher,Chardonnay,90.0,30.0,2,"Pink grapefruit, Meyer lemon and watermelon candy notes show on the nose of this rosé. There's a burst of vibrant energy to each sip, with lemon, raspberry and cherry syrup flavors. It's lively and fun."
Hamilton,Malbec,87.0,18.0,1,"Bright, fresh and fruity, this is loaded with citrus—especially grapefruit—goodness. There are layers of pears and peaches, making this a big, fruity, mouth-filling wine."
Hamilton,Red Blend,87.0,28.0,1,"A rich, earthy Syrah from a new Terre Rouge vineyard designate, this exhibits well-integrated dark red and blue fruit amidst tobacco and herb highlights."
HammerSky,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.67,61.0,3,"A blend of mostly Grenache, with smaller amounts of Tempranillo and Syrah, this is smooth and polished, with dried fruit flavors. It bears a leaf note and a whiff of mint, with a muscular, tannic finish that adds complexity."
HammerSky,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.33,92.67,3,"Sourced from one of the older vineyards in the region, Mettler has stayed true to Lodi's larger Zinfandel style with Epicenter, a wine that's black as night with notes of dark berry, plum, tar and brick, as well as a hint of tobacco and dark chocolate. Layered and complex, it's full bodied, but retains enough acidity to taste balanced despite its oak and ample alcohol. Enjoy with hearty fare."
HammerSky,Merlot,88.67,71.0,3,"Trine, named for the three main partners at Pepper Bridge winery, is predominantly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with a final 12% of the blend divvied up among the other three Bordeaux red grapes. It shows good balance and complexity, phenolic ripeness, texture and herbal detail. But despite so many good traits, it has less concentration than most wines in its price category."
HammerSky,Red Blend,89.0,54.0,2,"Sourced from the Dineen vineyard in the heart of the Yakima valley, this cool site in a cool vintage puts the emphasis on botanical aromatics and a  vivid, penetrating palate of citrus skin and flesh."
HammerSky,Zinfandel,91.0,49.0,2,"An aromatic explosion with notes of white pepper, menthol, black cherry, and vanilla. It's medium bodied with citrusy acidity and firm tannins with oak notes fleshing out the finish. A delightful bottle that deserves a place at the dinner table."
HandCraft,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,9.0,2,"A dated but not outdated blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Mourvedre, Cabernet Franc, and Sangiovese that brings notes of herbs, green beans, and floral notes. It's rich and sweet with plump fruit flavors and dry tannins."
HandCraft,Chardonnay,86.0,10.0,1,"Exciting, fresh and full of spicy, toasted undertones, this wine immediately calls for a food pairing of a richer seafood (think oysters, crab) or poultry. The flavors are balanced and buoyed by crispness, but the wine still offers complexity and a lingering finish."
HandCraft,Malbec,89.0,12.0,1,"This small production (200 cases) Pinot Noir is a mix of older and younger estate vines, a selection of lots given 22 months in 60 and 132 gallon French oak casks. It's still tasting quite young, sharp and chewy, with spicy fruit backed up against earthy tannins. Give it plenty of breathing time."
HandCraft,Petite Sirah,89.0,12.0,1,"This new vintage of the Zena Crown seems already faded. Light, tart strawberry fruit lacks concentration and carries a bit of bitter herb flavor. Tannins are earthy and the finish abrupt."
HandCraft,Pinot Grigio,86.5,10.5,2,"This wine is a bit reluctant on the nose at first, eventually showing focused notes of honeysuckle, fresh-squeezed lime and kiwi. The palate is delicate and light, with apple cider and cut-pear flavors."
HandCraft,Pinot Noir,87.0,9.0,1,"Campfire smoke punctuates the opening of this intensely dense wine. It veers into jammy, syrupy territory, red and black berry fruit exploding at its juicy core."
HandCraft,Red Blend,86.5,11.0,2,"Off dry and fruity, this simple wine tastes like peach juice, with a bit of citrus. It's pleasant but one-dimensional."
Hanna,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,34.0,2,"This wine comes from the original, own-rooted, 1965 plantings. It would be interesting to trace the ancestry of these vines, as such things were far less understood 50 years ago. Soft, round and fruity, this offers pleasant flavors of melon and apple. A dash of vanilla cookie coming through as it finishes."
Hanna,Chardonnay,86.5,25.0,2,"Here is a friendly, fruity, medium-bodied wine with light apple and pear aromas. Off-dry flavors are more melony and floral, and the wine has a relatively soft texture. Made from old vines and fermented in stainless steel, it offers subtle charms."
Hanna,Zinfandel,89.5,54.5,2,"Damp forest and dried cherry with cranberry combine on the nose and palate in this wine, sourced predominantly from Monterey County. Soft and silky it risks veering off balance once the oak begins to unwrap, becoming quite burly on the finish."
Hannah Nicole Vineyards,Malbec,85.0,38.0,1,"More orange or lightly blush than straw-hued, this is a fine single-vineyard wine. It's bone-dry, complex and sophisticated, with persistent pear and peach skin flavors, offering more detail and less obvious fruit than most Oregon Pinot Gris."
Hannah Nicole Vineyards,Petite Sirah,83.0,38.0,2,"Pommard and Dijon clones planted in 2001 fuel this tasty wine. Its dusty plum and black cherry fruit carries a touch of dark chocolate, all framed by firm yet polished tannins. Built to age, it can be enjoyed now with a good decanting."
Hannah Nicole Vineyards,Red Blend,82.0,38.0,1,"A brick red in color, this bottling of an usually blended variety is quite compelling and delicious, starting with the intriguing nose of pine needle and smashed red plum. The palate picks up Mourvèdre's leathery hallmark, which gives rustic elegance to the red cherry and pine needle spice."
Hannah Nicole Vineyards,Rosé,88.0,14.0,1,"Consistent with the 2014 Confero, this blends multiple clones from five different vineyards. Its details are sharp, framing taut red fruit with a vein of licorice before resolving into dusty tannins. It delivers excellent length, muscle and definition."
Hanzell,Chardonnay,95.0,78.0,1,"A blend of Merlot (50%), Cabernet Franc (40%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (10%), this aromatic wine brings aromas of funk, earth, truffle, fire pit, dried peat, herb and cherry. The flavors are soft, silky and refined, showing a sense of grace—a very pretty expression of a Bordeaux-style blend."
Happy Canyon Vineyard,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,60.0,2,"Just slightly off-dry, this excellent bottle mixes its ripe lemon, orange and papaya fruit with breakfast tea-like flavors. Its acidity is ample enough to keep the sweetness at bay, making it a fine, all-purpose wine that should please a wide variety of palates."
Happy Canyon Vineyard,Cabernet Franc,90.0,21.0,1,"This is a powerful Pinot Noir that jumps toward the nose with black raspberry and other dark fruits as well as strong cedar and caramel aromas. Thick raspberry and rounded cherry flavors show on the sip, which enjoys strong and compelling spice notes of clove, star anise and even some licorice. Pair with steak."
Haraszthy,Zinfandel,88.33,22.33,3,"This private selection is nicely structured, pitting clean raspberry fruit against tight tannins. Those strong components are accented with touches of cola and earth and a subtle undercurrent of barrel toast."
Harbes Family Vineyard,Chardonnay,86.0,18.0,1,"This is technically a white wine but with eyes closed it could be taken for a big red. The color is orange, the aromas are earthy and extremely citric, while the flavors are laser focused on orange and lemon zest. Acidity and tannins coat the palate and give it a mouth-puckering grip. It's not for the meek, but the adventurous will love it."
Hard Row To Hoe,Barbera,85.0,20.0,1,"From a site adjacent to the Pines vineyard, this rare Oregon Zinfandel deftly melds toast, sweet spice, buttered nut, espresso and black cherry flavors. It's big, bold, dark and delicious, with more lift than its high alcohol might suggest."
Hard Row To Hoe,Cabernet Franc,87.0,35.0,2,"A toasty wood-smoke aroma meets firm, vivid and rather tart fruit flavors in this medium-bodied, elegant and cerebral wine. It has firm structure and good balance, as fine-grained tannins and tangy acidity support the red-cherry and raspberry flavors."
Hard Row To Hoe,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,29.0,1,"This is the winery's fruitier, more accessible Syrah. Full bodied and fruity, it's fine introduction to Terre Rouge wines."
Hard Row To Hoe,Merlot,88.0,20.0,1,"This shows smooth, varietally correct fruit, however, the flavors are a bit muted. The softness is pleasant, but takes the lift out of the wine, finishing with drying tannins."
Hard Row To Hoe,Red Blend,86.0,28.0,1,"This spicy white blend mixes Viognier, Sémillon and Pinot Gris. Notes of green berries and other green fruits—notably banana—all have an herbal underpinning."
Hard Row To Hoe,Rosé,90.0,22.0,1,"Forward and fruity, this is a tight, tart wine with a jumble of berry and bramble flavors. It's peppery, spicy, but don't look for too much complexity. Gulp it down for the enjoyable quaffer that it's meant to be."
Hard Row To Hoe,Syrah,86.0,32.5,2,"This is a bit lighter than the previous vintage, offering tart red-berry fruit, accented with a note of fresh herb. The chocolaty barrel accents smooth out the midpalate and lead into a pleasant finish."
Hard Row To Hoe,Viognier,87.0,18.0,1,"Strong scents and flavors of oak and spice mask the fruit. It feels a bit flat on the palate, as if heading toward early oxidation. The oak and butterscotch flavors carry through onto the finish. Two bottles tasted."
Hard Six Cellars,Syrah,93.0,50.0,2,"Copper-orange-pink in color, this wonderfully summery wine offers tart citrus and gravelly minerality, a taste of wet stone coated in just the right amount of sweetness."
Hargrave,Chardonnay,83.0,7.0,1,"This wine is pale peach in color. It starts with aromas of strawberry, herb and spice that lead to juicy, just-off-dry, well-balanced fruit flavors that provide a whole lot of appeal."
Hargrave,Rosé,83.0,10.0,1,"This blends 51% Merlot with 29% Zinfandel, 15% Petit Verdot and 5% Petite Sirah, combining nicely for a full-bodied expression of chocolate and dried dark cherry. On the palate, it becomes dusty and somewhat rustic, with an intensely juicy finish."
Harken,Chardonnay,90.0,15.0,2,"Mineral, dried peach, lees and honeysuckle aromas lead to just off-dry flavors. Racy acidity frames it nicely."
Harmony Cellars,Meritage,91.0,39.5,2,"This blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon offers fresh blackberries on cold slate and a light herbal character with dill, oregano and tarragon. A minty quality carries into the sip, where black plum, pepper dust and light tar show."
Harmony Cellars,Red Blend,87.5,22.5,2,"Honeycomb and a fruit basket of melon and berry ride a wave of medium acidity and mellowed sweetness, with a touch of green apple. This is a good call for morning Mimosas."
Harney Lane,Zinfandel,90.5,34.5,2,"Perhaps made in a light-bodied style, this wine comes off as herbal and a touch green, with a dullness on the palate. Aged in 30% new French oak, it takes on a taste of coffee bean that intrigues."
Harper Voit,Pinot Blanc,92.0,20.0,2,"This wine has a flabby quality that takes away some of its complexity, showing a mix of flavors that lean into green olive and sour lemon."
Harper Voit,Pinot Noir,92.0,56.0,7,"A wine strong in personality and yet restrained in taste, rich in green olives, violets and herbs, surrounded by soft tannins and earthy black pepper. Structured, age this baby for 3–7 years and the herbal character should refine in wonderful ways, the texture only get softer."
Harper Voit,Riesling,94.0,30.0,1,"The winery's 13th release of its flagship Tempranillo has notes of red fruit, savory spices and chocolaty oak accents (95% French, 20% new). The fruit flavors are soft with a velvety texture, surrounded by tightly coiled tannins and tart acidity."
Harrison Clarke,Syrah,91.0,55.0,2,"Spiced cranberry fruit highlights this tightly-wound young Pinot Noir. Some hard raspberry candy flavors continue through the mid-palate, with chewy acidity leading into a tight, tangy finish."
Harry & David,Pinot Noir,84.0,30.0,1,"This cuvée is billed as the “little sister” to the winery's Evenstad Reserve, and the flavors fit the title. There is a pleasing roundness and an immediate accessibility, with flavors of red fruit and light chocolate in the foreground. Brambly berries are at the core, with highlights of malted milkshake, spice and a hint of finishing citrus."
Harry & David,Red Blend,83.0,20.0,1,"This is a juicy blend of blueberry-swaddled Carignane, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah that's also got cherry and raspberry fruit lurking around the edges. Firm, spicy and delicious, it's an out-of-the-ordinary blend that'll surprise and please, especially alongside Asian-inspired short ribs or anything caramelized."
Harry & David,Rosé,83.0,18.0,1,"The 2010 BlackJack is loaded with tart cranberry and pomegranate fruit flavors. There is a streak of iron and darker notes that come through in earthy, slighted roasted tannins. The complexity is intriguing and adds depth to a rather light vintage."
Harry & David,Tempranillo,84.0,20.0,1,"This excellent wine has good concentration and pretty, fruit-sweet flavors of berry, cherry, and a splash of Dr. Pepper. It brings in elegant details of truffle and more of that pleasant cola character, and lingers through a generous finish."
Hart,Cabernet Franc,88.0,40.0,1,"Coming from two area standouts—Lewis and Phinny Hill vineyards—this wine shows appealing aromas and flavors of shaved coconut, Mounds Bar, cherry and baking spices. The barrel influence is prominent but it largely stands up to it."
Hart,Sangiovese,89.0,22.0,1,"Voluptuous white peach and lighter butter notes form a classic nose set against a chalky backbone of lemon verbena and pink apple skins. The palate is tightly knit with lime skins, quinine and pink grapefruit pith, proving versatile and tartly acid-driven in style."
Hart,Syrah,91.0,60.0,1,"A new effort from Jigar Vineyards, sourcing some very good grapes, Sedition is light, clear and lingering on the palate in cherry-cola, mint and dried herb. Balanced and on the lighter side in terms of body and tannin, it's ready for the table, with a juicy, persistent finish."
Hart 2 Hart,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,25.0,2,"Soft, rounded waves of red plum become succulent on the palate without overwhelming, despite a full-bodied style and personality. A heave of subtle tannin plays out to add body and weight as the wine develops in the glass."
Hartley-Ostini,Pinot Noir,88.5,39.0,2,"A tasty tang of toasted oak adds a great top note to this full-flavored and full-bodied wine, so that it seems to build complexity from the bass notes of ripe pear, to the butter and cinnamon in the middle and up to the wrapping of spicy, smoky oak."
Hartwell,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,125.0,1,"Smashed berries, honeyed coffee, leather, beef jerky, cola and black pepper show on the nose of this complex wine by the legendary Hearst family. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with lightly roasted coffee notes, touches of seared caramel, sesame oil and teriyaki and a base of dried black-plum fruit."
Hauer of the Dauen,Pinot Noir,81.0,14.0,1,"This is a concentrated, dark and brooding wine from the producer's well-known property, sparkling in acidity despite its intensity of weight and length. Blackberry and nutmeg sit atop a soft integration of tannin and oak. Drink now through 2020."
Havens,Red Blend,83.0,65.0,1,"From winemaker John Kane, who worked for years with Kent Rosenblum, this wine is dense and decadently rich and concentrated, a jammy, thick flavor explosion of soy sauce, black olive and Dr. Pepper cola. Smooth on the palate, it threatens to overpower in ripeness before pulling back just enough to show complexity."
Hawk Watch Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,62.0,2,"This wine is not aromatic at first, blossoming slowly into shy layers of red berry and subtle cinnamon before taking on a pleasant juiciness and medium weight. The tannins are non-agressive and integrated into the spicy finish."
Hawk Watch Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,88.0,30.0,1,"This is a nicely balanced wine from estate-grown vines, a mix of licorice and raspberry that offers luxurious mouthfeel and texture atop surprising acidity. A small amount of Viognier was used in fermentation to provide some additional lift and floral aromas, while a dustiness prevails on the finish."
Hawk Watch Winery,Red Blend,85.0,29.0,2,"A showy but crisp and fresh style of Chard, this offers honey butter, ripe apple flesh, yellow roses, lemongrass and the slightest show of guava tropicality on the nose. The sip begins with that tropical guava and mango character, then tightens on mandarin orange and lemon rind."
Hawk Watch Winery,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.67,31.0,3,"The Aviator Red is a well-crafted blend that mixes strawberry, raspberry, pepper and stone in an effective balance that seems to draw the best from each grape. For a modest, everyday wine, this works quite well."
Hawk Watch Winery,Syrah,87.0,52.0,1,"After almost losing a finger struggling to remove the rock-hard faux wax “capsule” I found this strawberry/cherry cordial-flavored wine quite pleasant. The fruit, from a Rattlesnake Hills vineyard, has a sweet core, while the tannins add an earthy streak of green tea."
Hawk and Horse Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,150.0,1,"A scintillating scent of rose petals opens up this pleasing wine, which continues with raspberry and cherry fruit, accented with light milk chocolate. It is not a heavy wine; in fact, if Franc can ever be called elegant, even feminine, this is how it should taste. The finish falls off rather quickly, but otherwise it is a fine effort."
Hawkins Cellars,Mourvèdre,87.0,34.0,1,"This pure Cabernet Sauvignon is not a heavy wine, but within its sleek profile are interesting flavors of berry, leaf and earth. Tannins are crisp and proportionate, and the fruit carries through a graceful, moderately long finish."
Hawkins Cellars,Pinot Noir,86.0,20.0,1,"At first high-toned, this opens nicely with crisp green apple fruit flavors. It's balanced and clear. Don't look for big, blowsy tropical flavors or buttery oak, though the barrel fermentation provides some texture to the finish. A great food wine."
Hawkins Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,28.0,1,"Nuanced rose water, pink grapefruit, ginger and lychee aromas are followed by off-dry fruit flavors and a floral finish. The feel and flavors win you over but the wine wants a little more acid to pull itself together."
Hawkins Cellars,Syrah,88.33,33.33,3,"Full and weighty, this vineyard-designate is salty and floral, offering whiffs of orange blossom around lime zest and brine. The minerality shines through despite the size, making for a food-friendly, yet hedonistic wine."
Hawkins Cellars,Viognier,86.67,23.33,3,"Slate, plum, red fruits, and baking spices of cinnamon and clove show on the nose of this wine from a longtime vineyard east of Solvang. It's fairly light in body, but with pleasing purple fruit flavors, a touch of coffee and a strong herbal complexity."
Hawks View,Pinot Gris,88.5,26.0,2,"There's a touch on barnyard on the nose of this bottling by one of the region's earlier settlers, with aromas of hay and oyster mushrooms adding intrigue to the cranberry fruit. The forest floor and juniper character is strong on the palate, where tart red fruit mixes with pencil lead and bergamot rinds."
Hawks View,Pinot Noir,87.67,41.33,3,"Merlot and Syrah make up the majority of this blend. Aromas of cherry, coffee, pencil lead and barrel spices are initially light and elusive while the plum and vanilla and flavors are much more generous."
Hawley,Chardonnay,87.0,31.0,2,"Bright lime skin, grapefruit pith and soda character show on the nose of this tight and clean bottling from the appellation's vanguard vineyard. The sip is all about texture and energy, with pear-skin flavors that are soft but grippy, plus acidity that is strong but never searing."
Hawley,Pinot Noir,90.0,43.5,2,"Velvety tannins underlie a concentrated body of menthol, peppercorn, cedar and blackberry, punctuated in coffee along the way. An estate-bottling from one of the appellation's longstanding resident wineries, this wine is bold and brawny."
Hawley,Zinfandel,90.0,32.0,1,"An element of menthol-cinnamon chewing gum shows on the nose of this wine, grown at high elevations above the Sonoma Valley. High-pitched acidity buoys velvety red fruit, with a clay-like flavor and texture to the tannins."
Hayward by Folin Cellars,Pinot Noir,90.0,45.0,1,"The fruit is light and a touch sour, with suggestions of watermelon and berry. It fades into a short finish with a citrusy frame."
Haywood,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,54.0,1,"This cuvée is a barrel selection, fermented with whole berries and aged in 35% new oak. Simple strawberry and raspberry fruit seems almost weightless, and the quick finish carries a strong streak of bouillon."
Haywood,Chardonnay,82.0,28.0,1,"Plump red cherry notes meet clove, allspice and dried ginger on the nose of this bottling. Though light in body, there's decent grip on the palate, where candied cherry and cranberry flavors are spiced with anise."
Haywood,Zinfandel,84.33,34.67,3,"This is a nice, low-key wine that won't make any enemies. It has crisp apple aromas, herbal touches and enough acidity to keep it lively on the palate."
Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards,Rosé,83.0,12.0,1,"Light in color, this wine offers fresh but concentrated dark berry and cherry flavors and strong black tea and rose petal aspects. The acidity is moderate and supportive."
HdV,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,66.0,1,"This gentle, quaffable wine offers light flavors of strawberry and apple. There's generous acidity, and despite the fairly substantial alcohol, it's modest in its proportions."
HdV,Chardonnay,90.0,66.0,2,"This combines Chardonnay, Malvasia Bianca, Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc in nearly equal parts. A sweet, floral nose of honeysuckle dominates before apricot jam and vanilla flavors enter the scene. Thick and concentrated, it finishes with a dry, crisp lemon note."
Headbanger,Red Blend,83.0,15.0,1,"This field blend of Grenache, Zinfandel, Carignane and Cinsault was fermented in stainless steel and partially aged in neutral oak. Its strawberry and orange flavors combine effortlessly within its light, dry frame."
Hearst Ranch,Cabernet Franc,87.0,35.0,2,"Wreaths of smoke surround pretty raspberry aromatics. The red and plummy purple-fruit flavors continue, along with some tannic muscle and grip. This is a mix of 667 and Pommard clones—still young and a bit tight."
Hearst Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,30.0,1,"The aromas draw you into the glass, with complex notes of smoked meat, plum, herb, flowers, orange peel and cinnamon. The mouthfeel is swoon-worthy, showing a compelling sense of intensity and balance. The sense of purity is knee buckling."
Hearst Ranch,Chardonnay,88.75,37.0,4,"This rich, dark take on the cool-climate vineyard delivers all the great Syrah components. Lavish cooked beef, fudge, loam and mint aromas accent its black currant and blueberry base. The palate is coated with soft, polished tannins that present savory beef and black currant flavors, steeped in peppercorn and lavender."
Hearst Ranch,Malbec,90.0,30.0,2,"Deep but elegant lilac and rose petal aromas meet loamy soil, river stone and tangy cranberry on the nose of this bottling from this historic vineyard. There is great depth to its flavors—a layering of dark raspberry thyme, anise and dill—while showing plenty of turned earth notes throughout."
Hearst Ranch,Petite Sirah,93.0,30.0,1,"Joseph Jewell's 2014s from remote Humboldt County are dazzling. The color off this wine is on the light side, and so are the raspberry, tea leaf and cinnamon flavors, but they make for a pleasant, harmonious combination. Medium body, vibrant acidity and firm but light tannins add to its appetizing character."
Hearst Ranch,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,22.0,1,"Bright raspberry fruit dominates here, backed with ample acidity. Give it a little breathing time and it fleshes out and lengthens. At this stage the fruit is clean and primary, but the overall structure suggests giving it another couple of years of bottle age for prime time enjoyment."
Hearst Ranch,Rosé,87.5,20.0,2,"Light and almost effervescent in the glass, this popular Grenache-based pink from Doug Margerum offers yeasty, Champagne-like aromas, soft lemon-peel scents and wet slate minerality. The palate's tingling acidity delivers chalky lime and cotton candy flavors, bound together with compelling tension."
Hearst Ranch,Tempranillo,89.0,32.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon (37%) and Cabernet Franc (34%) make up the majority of this wine, with the balance Merlot (16%), Malbec (8%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas are quite locked up, with light notes of barrel spice, herb and assorted dark fruit. The palate has light tightly coiled fruit flavors. It needs time to reveal its charms. Best after 2021."
Hearst Ranch,Zinfandel,92.0,45.0,1,"This cool-climate bottling from the young producer shows tons of florality and spice, from violet and lilac to white pepper and dried herb, underscored by blueberry and tar aromas. It's light and lithe in body, with elderberry, potpourri and pepper flavors, but the tannic tension is most compelling, clinging to the palate from start to finish."
Heart Catcher,Merlot,90.0,30.0,2,"Tart but full cranberry aromas meld with sagebrush and cardamom on the nose of this bottling from an increasingly popular vineyard in this appellation. Baking spice and dried ginger mark the palate, which is acid-driven and lively, accenting its core of raspberry and pencil lead flavors."
Heart Catcher,Zinfandel,91.5,33.0,2,"Named for the producer's farmhouse and its surrounding vineyard, this offers rich cherry cordial and weedy sage notes—a seamless mix of fruit and earth. Sage, cardamom and spicy white pepper flavors give it intrigue and complexity, wrapped in a thick, velvety texture."
Heartache,Pinot Grigio,84.0,11.0,1,"Kiona's ice wines are legendary, and this latest is as excellent as any they've done. Butterscotch scents invite further exploration. As the wine coats the mouth, it comes into lush focus with brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, cooked banana and more butterscotch. It's low in alcohol, but maintains sufficient acidity to stay buoyant and lively. Residual sugar is a hefty 170 g/L."
Heaven's Cave,Merlot,82.0,24.0,1,"The most floral and lemony of Charles Smith's trio of Viogniers, this received extra time in barrel, yielding a more Burgundian mouthfeel—rich and creamy. Just 10% saw new oak, which seems to be exactly right, adding a hint of toast without clobbering the floral subtleties."
Heaven's Cave,Syrah,82.0,24.0,1,"As with Dunham's other Lewis Vineyard designates, this is 100% varietal, showcasing the distinct imprint of the vineyard as it impacts one specific grape. Sharp and smoky, with bright flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit, the wine remains deep, pure and focused as it runs through an extended, detailed finish."
Hecho por Ruben,Grenache,94.0,55.0,1,"Dry and crisply detailed, this delicious, bracing Riesling combines refreshing minerality with delicate yet complex fruit flavors of apple, pear and tangerine. It's full-bodied and drinking beautifully, but has the structure to develop over a decade or more. You decide whether to enjoy it now or tuck it away."
Hecho por Ruben,Syrah,94.5,55.0,2,"In this suave and attractive wine, spicy oak aromas lead to rich fruit and more spicy oak flavors, all wrapped in a soothing texture of light tannins and subtle acidity. It's a pleasure to drink."
Hedges,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,48.67,3,This estate-grown wine mixes earthy strawberry and raspberries against a tannic backbone that lends plenty of strength. Let it unwind a while in the glass.
Hedges,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,92.0,45.0,1,This estate-grown wine comes from one of Livermore's best boutique wineries. A generous mouthfeel and plenty of ripe fruit flavors make this youthful and full-bodied wine easy to taste and swallow. Hints of milk chocolate ride along with solid cherry and blueberry flavors.
Hedges,Chardonnay,88.0,9.0,1,"Prickly acidity marks the entry of this wine, blowing off over time to reveal cucumber, dill and a layering of black cherry, clove and tobacco. The thicket of tannins softens in the glass."
Hedges,Red Blend,89.0,20.0,2,"The aromas show notes of chocolate and raspberries, sprinkled with violets and fresh herbs, not seeming to have fully blossomed. The palate is elegant and refined, displaying a lovely sense of restraint. Smoked-meat flavors linger on the finish. It doesn't always come off as entirely varietal but brings a lot of enjoyment."
Hedges,Syrah,88.0,30.0,2,"Light pink in color, this wine offers aromas of strawberry, bubblegum, cherry and melon. It drinks off dry, with mouthwatering fruit flavors."
Hedges,White Blend,89.0,24.5,2,"Smoky, nutty aromas blend well with rich, baked-fruit flavors and baking spices in this broadly built, velvet-textured and full-bodied wine."
Hedges Family Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,17.0,1,A robust structure of tannin and oak in this fuller-bodied wine masks the finer components of black cherry and blackberry fruit that lurk underneath layers of tobacco and cigar box.
Hedges Family Estate,Chardonnay,87.0,17.0,1,"Made from a majority of Merlot rounded out by other red Bordeaux varieties, this wine leans savory, featuring mushroom and leather within a suggestion of Martini olive water. The fruit is more shy, revealing black currant at best, with a flat, ghost-like finish."
Hedges Family Estate,Merlot,89.0,17.0,1,"Clear and light in color and texture, this offers an inviting floral and citrus bouquet, while the palate flirts with Asian five-spice and black cherry. While the fruit is compelling, the structure is undefined and the finish a tad flat."
Hedges Family Estate,Red Blend,89.67,22.0,3,"This has a barrel-aged style, with a buttery and possibly oaky note in the aroma and a smooth texture. Mostly mellow pear and ripe apple flavors are spiced with a bit of vanilla and nutmeg. Medium bodied, it stays crisp through the finish."
Hedges Family Estate,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,15.0,1,"This lightly sweet wine has an intense oaky, peppery, smoky aroma and the flavors come out the same way. The beefy, liquid-smoke character should match ribs in barbecue sauce."
Heintz,Syrah,90.0,46.0,1,"This bottling's slightly dank nose recalls the front lawn being cut on a hot summer day, but a warmer, more inviting peach and nectarine fruit component awaits in the background. The palate is tangy with sharp lime peels and a bit tarry."
Heitz,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,225.0,1,"From 30-year-old vines, this is one of the finest examples of this variety to come out of the state in recent vintages. It delivers citrus, candlewax, lees, apple and pear aromas, the palate sleekly styled with a blast of acidity that makes it a versatile pour for the dinner table."
Helix,Red Blend,88.0,20.0,1,"Floral and fragrant, this lovely lighthearted sparkling wine is sublime and lemony in texture, with a bushy frothy mousse. Green apple shines brightest, with additional accents of strawberry and peach that punctuate the palate."
Helix by Reininger,Merlot,88.67,28.67,3,"Rich, thick and swimming in youthful tannin, this is a powerful statement from the producer's estate, a broad-shouldered explosion of fruity and savory flavors. Spicy tea, pomegranate and black cherry mingle around a tartness of grapefruit and blood orange, coalescing into a balanced whole."
Helix by Reininger,Red Blend,88.0,20.0,7,"Named for the proprietor/winemaker's favorite two roses, the flowers not the wine, this is indeed a wholly floral experience, subtle and delicately crafted to exude wild strawberry, orange and lime. Dry and refreshingly crisp in acidity, it's a light take on beautiful complexity."
Helix by Reininger,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.25,33.5,4,"This blend of equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese delivers bright cranberry, vanilla, coconut, baking spice, raspberry and milk chocolate aromas. Fruit and barrel flavors play off each other nicely on the light, lifted palate. Oak plays a primary role but is well integrated."
Helix by Reininger,Sangiovese,87.67,29.67,3,"A dramatic spiciness infuses this full-bodied wine with complexity from the aroma through the flavors and lingering finish. It has a dominant streak of smoky oak, a generous mouthfeel, mild tannins and plenty of blackberry and black plum notes."
Helix by Reininger,Viognier,88.0,33.0,1,"This leads with plum, vanilla, barrel spice and herb aromas. The palate is soft and velvety, keeping the vineyard's often burly tannins well in check and providing a lot of textural appeal. Cocoa notes linger on the finish, delivering a yum factor that is hard to ignore."
Hellfire,White Blend,87.0,16.0,1,"Aromas of wood smoke and grilled meat set up bold smoky, peppery flavors in this complex, spicy and full-bodied wine. The savory beefy aspects are a pleasure to taste and there is a good foundation of mild tannins and solid cherry flavors."
Helwig,Barbera,90.0,35.0,2,"Onesta is Jillian Johnson's debut of her own wines; she previously made Cinsault-based reds and rosés for the Phoenix Ranch brand. She is not new, however, to the indelible Bechthold Vineyard and its ancient Cinsault grapes, and her passion and expertise with the site shows gorgeously here. Orange-pink in hue, this beauty shares notes of crushed strawberry that are perfectly in balance with its dry, elegant point-of-view. Sip this one all night long, with food or without."
Helwig,Red Blend,86.5,18.0,2,"A Cabernet Sauvignon from historic Livermore Valley vineyards, including Ghielmetti, Home Ranch and Smith Ranch, all single-vineyard designated Cabernets in their own right, The Premier represents the winery's best of the überbest, aged entirely in new French oak. With aromas of raspberry, currant and coconut, the wine is balanced and relatively austere, light in weight with a long finish. A hint of tobacco and licorice round things out. This is a lovely wine that's ready to age."
Helwig,Rosé,86.0,18.0,2,"Made from organically farmed grapes grown in an estate vineyard, then cradled in American oak, this delivers subdued aromas of ripe, lusty lemon and big oak. Lurching toward the finish are flavors of caramel and bittersweet dried fruit."
Helwig,Syrah,91.0,28.0,2,"This kitchen-sink blend is made up of 67% Zinfandel, followed by 28% Cabernet Sauvignon and a small handful of Merlot. Aged in both French and American oak, less than half of it new, it's soft and quite tannic, with Zin's rightful spicy red fruit at its core."
Helwig,Verdelho,86.0,32.0,1,"This blend of Tempranillo and Touriga Nacional delivers aromas of dried cherries, light herbs and graphite. There is a lot of acid on the palate, and the red fruit, lightly spiced flavors are reminiscent of an everyday table wine, just with higher sugar levels."
Hendry,Albariño,91.0,20.0,1,"This wine has a light color and appealing notes of candied strawberries, herbs, brown stems and forest floor. It's light and airy—surprising given the general power of the vintage—with delicate, mouthwatering fruit flavors."
Hendry,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,38.0,2,"Sweet cherry and vanilla aromas are most noticeable in this soft, juicy Cab, with streaks of cassis playfully integrated throughout. Dry tannins and diesel oak build up steam on the finish, which is medium in length."
Hendry,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.5,55.0,2,"Caramel and vanilla wrap around generously ripe flavors of apple, pear and tropical papaya. Entirely fermented in oak, its wood provides a medium-bodied mouthfeel and ample accents of sweetness and spice."
Hendry,Chardonnay,87.0,30.0,1,"A deep, deep color, lots of spicy, smoky oak aromas and rich, almost sweet flavors add up to a bold barbecue sauce of a wine. Those who love lots of spice, loads of smooth tannins and very full body will be happy."
Hendry,Malbec,88.0,29.0,1,"This robust Zin is meaty in Italian sausage aromas, with streaks of cedar and dark plum intertwined throughout. Balanced in terms of acidity and weight, it finishes in a generous helping of leathery tannins and oak."
Hendry,Merlot,85.0,38.0,1,"This blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache blend is high in alcohol and ultra ripe with fruit. It's pushed well past any subtlety, with dark black fruit flavors, chewy tannins and some heat on the finish."
Hendry,Pinot Gris,90.0,18.0,2,"The production of this nationally-distributed wine almost doubled this vintage, making it one of the most visible Oregon Pinots in the country. It's medium bodied and offers good varietal character, but there is a slight off-note on the nose, which carries through the finish, albeit subtly."
Hendry,Pinot Noir,90.0,33.0,2,"This smooth and easy-drinking wine blends 60% Pinot Gris with equal amounts of Chardonnay and Riesling. It's light blush in color, with hints of honey on both the nose and palate. A good, all-purpose white, it should be consumed over the next year or two."
Hendry,Zinfandel,88.5,35.0,2,"From estate-grown grapes, this opens with sizable, grippy tannins and strong barrel-heavy aromas. It then settles down into layers of blackberry and blueberry, sprinkled with a hint of cinnamon. This wine will benefit from a decant or a few more years in bottle."
Henry Earl,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,40.0,1,"Subtle aromas and flavors of crisp apple and cherry, a dry composition, fine texture and crisp finish make this rather reserved and well balanced. This reliable standby is the kind of bubbly to have on hand for spur-of-the-moment occasions."
Henry Earl,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,45.0,1,"Bright, tangy, lean and appetizing, this light-bodied wine has mouth-cleansing acidity, lemon and green apple flavors, a zingy balance and clean, dry finish. Time to bring on the oysters or goat cheese."
Henry Estate,Pinot Noir,84.5,32.0,2,"This balanced wine comes from an Alexander Valley vineyard not far from the Chalk Hill and Russian River appellations. The site is cool enough at night to help the grapes retain  acidity and a juicy, lemon-lime complexion."
Henry Estate,Red Blend,86.0,23.0,1,"Made from 100% Muscat di Canelli grapes, retaining 9.5% residual sugar, this is a perfumed dessert wine, reminiscent of Gewürztraminer in its lychee aromas. It remains balanced and light on the palate, not overly sweet."
Henry Estate,Rosé,85.0,15.0,1,"This barrel selection offers aromas of peach, apple and lime sorbet, with a sharper sense of dried herbs as well. The palate delivers high-tone flavors of chopped dill, tart apple, lime peel and cut grass. A lean and focused wine."
Hensteeth,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.67,49.0,3,"The nose is slighted lifted and high-toned. But the pleasing flavor of fresh raspberry takes over on the palate, and light touches of cocoa and sandalwood from 18 months in barrel bring a bit of depth to the finish."
Hensteeth,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.33,57.33,3,"A Chenin with 15% Viognier in the mix, this bottling has more depth and fullness than many of Clarksburg's other Chenins. It's creamy yet retains plenty of acidity, it has a tropical fruit imprint and even a touch of grapefruit. It will stand up to all kinds of spicy foods."
Herencia,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,100.0,1,"Stainless fermented and aged, this tart, apple-flavored Pinot Gris is close to fresh cider in flavor. The alcohol is low enough that it is almost invisible. Just pure, juicy, clean fruit comes through."
Heringer,Red Blend,85.0,30.0,1,"Even with Merlot and Cabernet Franc in the mix, there's no mistaking this is a Zinfandel. It has pepper and jam flavors, with straightjacketlike tannins and plenty of body."
Heringer,Teroldego,88.0,35.0,1,"Already aging quickly, this very ripe wine leans into the raisin and prune end of the flavor spectrum. Backed with a generous dose of baking spice, it's a soft and plummy wine ready for near-term enjoyment."
Herman Story,Grenache,91.0,48.0,1,"Sweet, soft tannins inform the entry to this 100% varietal wine, a decadent exploration of dark chocolate and graham cracker. Powerful and intense, it smoothes out as it opens, revealing plush layers of blackberry and plum."
Herman Story,Rhône-style Red Blend,95.0,48.0,1,"A tiny-production wine from a windblown ridge in the Petaluma Gap, Badger Block is earthy and piquant in wild strawberry. Spicy and soft, it's almost velvety on the palate. Persistent in depth and length, the body is generous but balanced, spiked with the scent of fresh-picked rose petals."
Herman Story,Syrah,95.0,47.0,1,"Light notes of pomegranate and hibiscus intertwine with Earl Grey tea and lavender on the nose of this wine from one of the region's most famous producers. There's lots of California chaparral spice on the nose, with aniseed, wild fennel and a cinnamon character decorating the cranberry, pomegranate and light strawberry flavors."
Herman Walters,Cabernet Sauvignon,81.0,18.0,1,"Lush aromas of dried rose petals, black currant jam, turned loam and fudge greet the nose on this blend of 63% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Franc, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 2% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot. A wide array of flavors hits the palate, from pencil lead, thyme, tomato leaf and black pepper to boysenberry, shaved dark chocolate, vanilla bean and cooked black cherries."
Hermann J. Wiemer,Riesling,87.0,26.0,1,"Dense boysenberry and peppery spice aromas are enhanced with chocolate cake and mint elements on this nose of this cool climate bottling by Adam Lee. There is lots of energy and brightness on the palate, with jammy blackberry fruits, licorice spice, black pepper verve and a touch of tar."
Heron Hill,Chardonnay,84.5,16.5,4,"From a tiny, organically farmed vineyard outside of Occidental, this wine is dense in earth, with a brambly nose of wild cherry and cranberry. Salty and herbal, it retains plenty of acidity on the light-bodied palate, offering a mix of cinnamon and tangerine on the finish."
Heron Hill,Riesling,83.0,12.0,2,"Thick, meaty and pure aromas of blackcurrant, crushed lavender and minty dark chocolate greet the nose on this special bottling from Iris Rideau. Black cherries wash onto the palate alongside an amazing array of spices, from Indian to Middle Eastern, showing allspice, mace and many dried herb components."
Herzog,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.57,51.43,7,"Tom Meadowcroft's second label, Thomas Henry, is also sourcing from Borden Ranch in Lodi, as is his slightly higher-priced, lower-alcohol Riesling under the Meadowcroft name. This one not as as fragrant at first, more austere, but fully inviting wih melon, honey and pear. Thai food would be the perfect pairing."
Herzog,Red Blend,87.0,25.0,1,"Another of Noceto's stellar small-production Sangiovese, this one plummy with tobacco and sour cherry most prominent and a slight hint of sweetness as it finishes. Dos Oakies comes from the winery's oldest vineyard section of Sangiovese and has a loyal following of Sangiovese lovers."
Hess,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.2,54.0,5,This 100% Mourvèdre rosé is rusty pink in color and offers inviting red plum and poached strawberry notes. There is a dollop of yeasty acidity on the palate and an iron earthiness that complements its plum and strawberry fruit.
Hess,Chardonnay,90.5,41.0,2,"This is the winery's most straight-forward pink, showing red plum, peach, light mulberry and steel aromas. It's all tension upon first sip, but then waves of ripe plum, citrus and brown spice overtake the palate."
Hess,Red Blend,89.0,41.5,2,"This high-alcohol mountain Zin seems to have already lost its zip, dominated by a raisiny overripeness that skirts dangerously into syrup land."
Hess,Rosé,87.0,13.0,1,"50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot with the balance Cabernet Franc and Malbec, it brings notes of brandy soaked cherry, licorice, herbs and barrel spices. The fruit flavors are plush in feel and tart with tightly wound, dry tannins."
Hess Collection,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.25,75.5,4,"This pure Cabernet spent 22 months in a mix of French and American oak, though what percentage was new is not stated. It enters the palate with a pleasing mix of cassis, tar and a hint of mint, then seems to hit a wall and fade."
Hess Collection,Chardonnay,86.0,14.0,1,"Mixed berry fruit flavors have an over-ripe, pruney character. A dark streak of smoke, licorice and chocolate runs straight through the core and the tannins turn a little bitter and rough. Drink now."
Hess Collection,Malbec,95.0,55.0,1,"Dense and juicy, bursting with a mix of berries and cassis. A delicate balance of acids and fine, ripe tannins provides the structural underpinnings, with the vineyard's characteristic streak of iron ore running straight down the spine."
Hess Collection,Red Blend,90.0,39.0,2,"The complement to the Camerata from Cadence, this estate-grown blend is 52% Cab Franc and 48% Merlot. There's a juicy core that is delightful, with ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit. Both of the Cara Mia wines see 50% new oak for a full 18 months, and at this early age this shows as aliquorous, almost bourbony aftertaste. The aromatics display dark notes of smoke and coffee, along with some mocha and cracker."
Hess Select,Red Blend,84.67,18.33,3,"The Tapteil vineyard designate is 53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cab Franc and 32% Merlot, from vines that are now 20 years old. With each new vintage the wine seems to gain in detail as a result. Tapteil fruit is distinguished by a distinctive dustiness, and sports an elegant structure whoselightness belies its power. With its spicy, acidic berry flavors, and hints of smoke and leather, this has an Italian personality as well."
Hestan,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.75,105.0,4,"This wine has unusual, penetrating, floral aromatics and a liqueur-like character. It was fermented in a mix of new and neutral French oak, and a caramel character comes in as the wine breathes open. Citrus peel and floral flavors remain through an extended finish."
Hestan,Red Blend,90.0,72.0,1,"Firm and compact, this marries tart red and purple fruit to tannins, with a soft streak of leather and a dusting of coffee grounds. Flavor integration is excellent, and the wine will drink well through 2019."
Hestia Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,25.0,1,"Browned butter, cinnamon-like spices and blackberry pie frame this Syrah from an estate vineyard owned of Zaca Mesa, the first winery to plant the grape in Santa Barbara County. There is more brown spice and blackberry on the palate, which is couched in an appealing tannic structure that smooths out as you drink it."
Hestia Cellars,Red Blend,88.0,40.0,1,"With residual sugar at 200 g/L, this is much more concentrated than the average wine labeled Late Harvest. With enough acidity to stay focused and avoid any suggestion of syrup, it's an exceptional value. Deep peach and apricot flavors and a hint of caramel linger through a satisfying finish."
Hewitt,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.67,266.67,3,"Quite lightly aromatic, it offers hints of barrel spice, cocoa, herbs and red fruit. The palate has coffee ice cream and vanilla flavors with a compact yet elegant feel, showing some grit to the tannins."
Hey Mambo,Red Blend,86.0,12.0,2,"A faint hint of pink shines on this sparkler named after the winery owners' dog. Aromas of fresh melon and slight peach lead to a faint cherry note upon sipping and creamy mouthfeel, followed by plum skin tartness and a yeasty, sour bitterness."
Hibou,Pinot Noir,89.5,58.5,2,"There's a burly amount of black fruit and black tea in this estate wine, concentrated and coiled in a tight tannic structure. The fruit tends toward ripe black cherry and even blackberry, the texture is soft and the finish delightfully marked by a touch of chocolate."
Hidden Jewel,Chardonnay,88.0,15.0,1,"Chalky earth, black pepper and clove comprise the nose on this wine, which gets a boost from 10% Merlot. The flavors are spicy and complex, with cedar, tea and a tiny bit of varietally distinct green pepper."
Hidden Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.5,92.5,2,"Lovely, light, fresh and delicate, this Barbera is young, juicy and appealing. The fruit mixes light berry flavors with tart, tangy acids; the flavors seem to gather in the mid-palate, showing excellent concentration. No new oak is evident, nor is it missed. The alcohol remains comfortably below 14%, and the fruit is light but quite ripe, with no green edges."
High Pass,Pinot Noir,91.5,37.5,2,"This 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is a fruity, rustic wine, with broad mixed berry and cherry flavors. They lead into an earthy and tannic (and short) finish."
High Pass,Rosé,90.0,12.0,1,"Waxy plum and a surprising characteristic of watermelon provide a subtle freshness to this otherwise hugely tannic, concentrated wine. Tar and yeast play a role as well."
Highland Hills Winery,Marsanne-Roussanne,81.0,25.0,1,"This 100% varietal wine shows medicine cabinet, barnyard, Band-Aid and dried fruit aromas followed by dried out fruit and medicinal flavors. The tannins bring some dryness."
Highland Hills Winery,Red Blend,80.0,28.0,1,"Light peach and ale notes mark the nose of this wine. The palate is dry, and the flavors somewhat flat, making it hard to ascertain the variety."
Highland Oaks,Grenache-Syrah,88.0,35.0,1,"This wine delivers light herb and citrus aromas. The flavors seem washed out, lacking cohesion. It comes off as quite generic."
Hightower,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.5,41.67,6,"This wine is tenacious in its grassy mix of pea shoots and gooseberry, interwoven with acidity that takes on a tartness that's not entirely pleasant."
Hightower,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,20.0,1,"Layers of mint and earth are slightly out of proportion in this leathery wine, the finish leaving a somewhat sour taste."
Hightower,Merlot,88.0,30.0,1,"This wine is a mix of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot that is tight, tannic and a tad green."
Hightower,Red Blend,89.33,53.33,3,"The 2010 Select is a step ahead of Torii Mor's single vineyard offerings, but holds to the common thread of hard, tart, tight wines with little flesh on their bones. Here the raspberry and strawberry fruit pokes through the herbs and tannins enough to warrant drinking sooner while waiting for the others to (possibly) soften up."
Hightower,Rosé,88.0,18.0,1,"This is a straightforward Merlot with herbal aromatics, oaky tannins and a layering of quiet raspberry and spice. Well priced for the quality and food-friendly nature of this wine."
Hightower,Syrah,87.67,20.0,3,"Tempting in raspberry, vanilla and spice, Wood's Clone 30 Cabernet Sauvignon is fully formed, rich, and slightly oaky with a finish of tobacco pipe."
Highway 12,Chardonnay,86.0,20.0,1,"This is a focused, riveting expression of Red Mountain Syrah from a great vineyard. It's packed with juicy flavors of fresh raspberries, tinged with tangerine-flavored acids. Elegant and fascinating, it's a pure, fruit-driven expression of the grape, bolstered by the natural minerality of Ciel du Cheval fruit."
Highway 12,Pinot Noir,83.0,38.0,1,"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay, from the oldest plantings (1972) in Washington State, displays exceptional concentration and palate weight. Apple pie, pear tart, baking spice, butter and caramel flavors abound. It's rich and packed with fruit, along with the seductive flavors that aging in new French oak can provide."
Highway 12,Red Blend,88.0,19.0,1,"This is a textural, bracing study in how to layer a Chardonnay. Green berries, apples, Asian pears, jicama, cucumber, wet stone and creamy lees flavors all combine seamlessly, placing the small percentage of wine aged in new oak in an appropriately light supporting role. Excellent length and perfect balance."
Hilary Goldschmidt,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,35.0,1,"Soos Creek's value-priced Sundance Red really shines in 2010. A Bordeaux-style blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot and 19% Cabernet Franc, it rivals the top-tier efforts from any number of wineries. Plum, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors are leavened with a dash of herb. Tannins are dusty and detailed, and the wine has the stuffing to age over the next half decade or more."
Hill Family Estate,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,85.0,2,"This is a wonderful edition to Pearl, Sparkman's 100% Sauvignon Blanc. It's vibrant and energetic, the kind of high-wire flavors more commonly found in Sancerre. Three days after it was first tasted, the wine was still drinking beautifully, with candied mixed fruits and terrific concentration."
Hill Family Estate,Red Blend,85.5,36.5,2,"Pretty raspberries, red currant and a hint of iodine spark the taste buds, then darker streaks of wood smoke and black licorice kick in. There's snappy acidity and an undertone of metal and stone. Complex and captivating."
Hilt & Blade,Zinfandel,91.0,20.0,1,"This little gem is sourced entirely from the Klipsun Vineyard, and it's the sort of wine that will wake up the sleepiest palate. A mass of fig, honeycomb, lemon rind and pith, it has wonderful focus, balance, length and concentration."
Hindsight,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,35.0,1,"An intoxicatingly sensual Grenache, velvety and light in cherry and strawberry fruit, smooth earth, a streak of anise and deep swirls of chocolate and caramel on the finish. The Dalton Vineyard in Calaveras County has been one to watch for in Syrah and Zinfandel; it can now add Grenache."
Hindsight,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,75.0,1,"Chris Gorman is the winemaker for this pure, old vine Cabernet Sauvignon. It is a full force gale of a wine, sappy and dense, with blackberry and cassis fruit wreathed in smoke and dark accents from aging in 100% new French oak. Young, big and bold, it remains poised and balanced, with juicy acidity keeping all the flavors in proportion."
Hindsight,Petite Sirah,86.0,55.0,1,"Baking spice, freshly hewn wood and dark fruit aromas are followed by pitch-black-fruit flavors. The volatiles are just in check."
Hip Chicks,Red Blend,82.0,24.0,1,"This wine gets a bonus for venturing into new territory, aging Cab in used Bourbon barrels. The result is far from perfect, but not as gimmicky as one might assume. Aromas of leathery blackberry, cedar, roasted pasilla chile and tons of caramel lead into flavors of cocoa, coconut and caramel on the creamy, peppery palate."
Hip Chicks,Rosé,83.0,18.0,1,"Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon make up most of this blend. Aromas of vanilla, spice and red and black fruit lead to soft-feeling fruit and barrel flavors that put a focus on elegance."
Hirsch,Chardonnay,87.0,60.0,1,"The name of this bottling, which included 6% Petite Sirah, implies youth, but a bit more age might be helpful for this rustic grape. Juicy and smoky aromas of ground coffee, blueberry, fudge and gravel show on the nose, while the palate presents tight raspberry, caramel and brisk oak flavors. It's interesting, though a tad thin."
Hirsch,Pinot Noir,90.19,74.44,16,The apple and cider aromas are vibrant while the palate offers plenty of dry tart fruit flavors. It brings appeal.
History,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,75.0,1,"Ripe, leaning to almost overripe, green and yellow-apple aromas lead to cidery flavors. Tart acidity backs it all up."
History,Gewürztraminer,88.0,40.0,1,"Pale pink in color, this wine offers aromas of herb, yeast, and overripe red apple. The apple-skin flavors are dry with tart acidity."
History,Muscat,87.0,40.0,1,"Malbec makes up 73% of this blend, with 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc. Dried herb and cedar give it an herbaceous character. Soft, moderate acidity provides a backbone against larger-sized tannins and a touch of bitter tobacco."
History,Pinot Noir,91.0,65.0,1,"Small production (one barrel!) single-vineyard Pinots are challenging, as there is no wiggle room via blending. This comes out crisp and focused, with light cherry fruit and ample flavors of tea, herb and leaf."
Hobo,Grenache,87.0,30.0,1,"Potent oaky aromas like nutmeg, cinnamon and toasted baguette meet abundant, jammy fruit flavors in this full-bodied and smooth-textured wine. It has moderate tannins that provide nice grip and shore up the oak and fruit components for balance."
Hobo,Zinfandel,88.0,30.0,1,"Earthy with subtle Asian spice and forest floor scents, this wine is medium in build and generous in tannin, still untangling its limbs in the glass."
Hogue,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,16.0,1,"This is indicated as a reserve-level selection, but at the moment remains unfocused, and even a bit dilute. Tart fruits and tight tannins never quite fit together. The drying finish carries a hint of wet cement. Give this at least another year or two of bottle age."
Hogue,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,23.0,8,"The nose of this bottling from a stone-strewn vineyard in the heart of the appellation is very restrained, offering wet concrete, lime and lemon pith scents, with a touch of sweet chive. Pink grapefruit and petrol notes show on the palate, which is layered with an intriguingly sticky texture."
Hogue,Chardonnay,86.67,23.5,6,"Darcie Kent really nails this Cab out of John Madden's Ranch. Pungently bold and moody, intensely herbal with green pepper and olive, wrapped within a wall of black pepper that lingers. Pair it with pepper steak."
Hogue,Malbec,83.0,25.0,1,"The easy-to-find Gnarly Head, a blend of 50% Zinfandel, 20% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petite Sirah and 3% Syrah, is young and ready to drink.Its fruity nose and peppery spice tmakes it a full-blown crowd pleaser ready for backyard barbecues."
Hogue,Meritage,85.67,14.67,3,"From a well-regarded site in the Horse Heaven Hills, this pure Malbec is clean and well-proportioned, but a bit on the simple side. Plain red fruit flavors, accented with light barrel notes, quickly fade on the delicate finish."
Hogue,Merlot,87.0,22.5,8,Fair Play-based Perry Creek's Cab has high toned blue and red fruit and is tamely structured for being from high-elevation vineyards. Its finish is sweetly floral.
Hogue,Red Blend,89.0,7.0,1,"Boysenberry, cracked rainbow peppercorns and dried rose petals show on the nose of this bottling, which plays to the lighter side of the grape. It's tart and brisk once sipped, with cranberry and pomegranate fruit given more complexity by a touch of wild fennel."
Hogue,Riesling,87.56,11.78,9,"Intriguing notes of sandalwood and cedar meet with dark red fruit and a touch of black pepper on the nose of this wine. The palate is layered with interesting touches of sage, marjoram, gravel and tar, hints of black cherry and loamy earth, and a chalky mouthfeel."
Hogue,Syrah,87.0,18.25,4,"Fresh and forward flavors mix rhubarb, ripe strawberries and sweet Bing cherries. This vibrant wine finishes with a refreshing snap of acidity, making it a pleasure to drink."
Hogue,Viognier,87.5,17.0,2,"A perfect shade of medium pink, this is a standard, down-the-middle rose. Lemon, watermelon and fresh-cut cherry-tomato notes play on the nose, while the palate packs raspberry and Key-lime flavors."
Hoi Polloi,Pinot Noir,92.0,52.0,1,"Super-dark in color, this extracted wine offers a reductive note on the nose, followed by a rustic tinge of hay and brick. Intensely flavored and oaked, it finishes unexpectedly herbal and dry."
Holdredge,Pinot Noir,93.0,54.0,5,"This wine is 86% Sangiovese with 14% Cabernet Sauvignon. Puckering in black fruit and a leathery texture, it shows potential in cedar, tobacco and a hint of black tea."
Holly's Hill,Carignane,90.0,28.0,2,"Brambly in blackberry jam, this is a fairly elegant and restrained version of the variety for the area. The mountain-grown grapes provide substantial tannins and a dusty taste of wood. Coffee marks the abbreviated finish."
Holly's Hill,Grenache Blanc,87.0,25.0,1,"Made with 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, this estate-grown wine is made in small lots and offers aromas of baked bread and red fruit from the get-go. The Cabernet shows its presence, and there's a wealth of bitter, leathery tannin offset by soft, approachable oak."
Holly's Hill,Mourvèdre,88.4,25.6,5,"Grown along the Bay Area's Peninsula near the heart of Silicon Valley, this wine is brisk and energetic, with raspberry, pomegranate, dried ginger, sage, rose petals and lavender on the nose. Earthiness leads the slightly sour palate, with turned dirt, juniper and iron, finishing on a menthol sensation."
Holly's Hill,Red Blend,90.0,32.0,2,"Light and tart, with high acid cranberry fruit flavors. It's clean and straightforward, though the old vines (some are 34 years old) do not deliver the complexity that might be anticipated."
Holly's Hill,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,27.0,2,"This wine is light in body, fruity and floral in flavor and smooth on the palate. Blended from seven varietals, it has peach and jasmine aromas, very generous fruit flavors that flirt with sweetness and a lush mouthfeel."
Holly's Hill,Rosé,90.5,21.0,2,"At five years old, this shows green pepper, dark fruit, tar and barrel spice scents followed by restrained fruit and barrel flavors. Its jalapeño-like notes are distracting."
Holly's Hill,Roussanne,88.0,18.0,1,"This is a big powerful overtly flavorful wine that demands attention. A vivid toasty savory aroma leads to rich spicy buttery nutty flavors that are mouth filling and a smooth, rather soft texture."
Holly's Hill,Viognier,87.0,22.0,2,"A heavy oak element dominates the aromas and flavors of this sweet-seeming, medium-bodied wine. It starts with toasted oak and smoked meat impressions and then gushes black-cherry and boysenberry notes on the palate."
Hollywood Hill,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,36.0,1,"With a reductive quality and prominent oak, this is a thick, concentrated wine built on unwavering tannins. The fruit is elusive and shy. Clove and cola eke out of an earthy element that's part rose garden, part smoke and eucalyptus."
Holman Ranch,Pinot Gris,91.0,18.0,1,"Dry and weighty at first on the palate, this wine is ultimately tart and tangy, awash in grippy acidity sparked by flavors of cherry and lime."
Holman Ranch,Pinot Noir,93.5,39.0,2,"This new Syrah from Betz is medium-bodied and displays light details of herb, olive, sage, a hint of lemon verbena, and tight red currant and berry fruit flavors. There is a pretty, finishing kiss of caramel and toasted almonds."
Holus Bolus,Roussanne,90.0,32.0,1,"Because he blends shortly after fermentation, Matt Loso's wines attain a seamless complexity early on; it's a hallmark of the winery. This beautifully crafted Claret has no rough edges; in fact, no edges at all. It is a supple, elegant wine, loaded with fruit flavors that run from berry to cherry to plum, while the oak gently adds spice and toast."
Holus Bolus,Syrah,94.0,35.0,2,"This is top drawer—elegant, detailed and richly varietal. The fruit is tart and tangy but not sour or thin. Mixed green fruits, apple, citrus, and a lightly toasty nose set up a wine with impressive length. The midpalate richness includes ripe melon, butterscotch and cinnamon spice. It's all barrel-fermented in neutral oak. This is a real strength of the brand."
Honig,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,95.0,2,"I can see why so many of Washington's winemakers love this young vineyard. It is already expressing the sort of subtleties that most viticulturalists would kill for. The fruit is ripe but not too sweet or jammy. It is annotated with citrus, leaf and stem, along with streaks of smoke and herb and mineral. It's all mixed together seamlessly and focused into a firm, almost muscular style with real authority."
Honig,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,28.0,1,"This is 100% Riesling, and the intense, floral aromas suggest a smattering of Gewürztraminer, at least in essence if not in fact. Beeswax, lemon candy, orange blossom and other juicy citrus components swirl around the palate, making this an exceptionally complex and beguiling wine. Though labeled dry, it carries an impression of fruit sweetness, rather than the bracing minerality of some other dry Rieslings. A wine that is almost Germanic in its attack, and a truly lovely bottle."
Honor Winery,Pinot Noir,88.0,55.0,1,"This Bordeaux blend has a surprisingly broad aspect, with very young fruit that opens up and then sits on the midpalate. It's much more open and expressive than the last few vintages. At first it seems dumbed down on the finish, but it slowly opens, and retasted on the second day it has filled out with muscle and verve."
Honor Winery,Red Blend,87.5,54.5,2,"A generosity of baked pear is supported by sizable notions of toasted oak and tannin in this burly, rich and concentrated wine."
Honor Winery,White Blend,84.0,20.0,1,"Fermented in stainless steel, this fresh vibrant wine brings aromas of green pepper, gooseberry and citrus. The just off-dry tropical-fruit flavors are light in style but show depth, lingering on the finish."
Hood Crest,Red Blend,84.0,28.0,1,"Meaty aromas of beef jerky and roasted game meet with licorice, black peppercorn and black raspberry on the nose of this bottling of a rarely used grape. The palate delivers lots of pepper and quite a bit of tannic grip, though flavors aren't too deep, with gamy elements the most prevalent."
Hood Crest,Sangiovese,86.0,26.0,1,"This is a smooth, well-mannered and distinctly varietal wine, richly rewarding in cola spice and earthy black tea, with a juicy finish."
Hooker,Chardonnay,90.0,24.0,1,"Mike Sinor is taking his fans on an experimental ride through his new oceanview vineyard, here presenting a rich take on Syrah. It's lush on the nose with olallieberry and blackberry fruit as well as rich bacon fat, vanilla bean and milkchocolate notes. Concentrated black cherry thrives on the palate alongside caramel and vanilla cream."
Hoopes,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,75.0,1,"Made from a slightly smaller percentage (81%) of estate fruit, with the intention of being approachable earlier, this wine has 19% blended in from Oakville Ranch, Knightsbridge and Young Inglewood, including 2% each of Malbec and Cabernet Franc. It jumps from the glass with yeasty black and red berry, a leathery, velvety mouthfeel and a fist of black pepper. Delicious now it should also age well, intense but bright in acidity."
Hoopes,Chardonnay,86.5,32.0,2,"From a vineyard adjacent to the Santa Lucia Highlands, this wine's wondrous nose of dense black currants, blueberries and fresh-cracked black pepper is made even more complex by black olive, gamy roasted meats and chaparral notes. Black pepper thrives on the palate in this cool-climate study, with touches of asphalt, elderberry fruit, charred meat and licorice all playing supportive roles."
Hoopla,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,25.0,1,"Red and black licorice figure into the soul of this softly smooth and likable mountain wine. Classic in its approach, and relatively medium bodied, it's lithe and elegant in texture, with faint traces of cedar, graphite and crisp currant."
Hoopla,Chardonnay,88.0,25.0,1,"Grippy in sizably powerful mountain tannins, this wine is at first difficult to penetrate and will benefit from further cellaring, through 2022. In the shadows lurk full-bodied hits of floral violet and earthy cedar, with a tease of beautifully bittersweet chocolate."
Horan Estates,Red Blend,88.0,20.0,1,"Dark strawberry and red-cherry fruit shows on the nose of this bottling by the regional pioneer, leveled by scents of violets, rose petals and pencil lead. Graphite and beet juice start the sip, which evolves into black olive, dried basil and bay leaf sprinkled atop cranberry and elderberry juice."
Horan Estates,Syrah,87.0,26.0,1,"Subtle fruit flavors mingle mountain berries, plums and cherries with enticing baking spices. There's a touch of herb, earth and tanned leather also, bringing complexity and texture into a lingering finish. Drink now through 2020."
Horse & Plow,White Blend,88.0,18.0,1,"Steely at first, this wine softens like butter on the palate, with a luxurious, silky feel, complemented by lemon zest and brine. Lighter in style, it never holds back on texture or flavor, making for a beautiful, food-friendly white."
Horsepower,Grenache,95.25,116.25,4,"From the mountains above Lake Sonoma, this rocky, robust and ultimately rewarding wine is spicy in cinnamon and clove lined in savory layers of black pepper and leather. Brambly blackberry lies in wait to untangle in the glass, adding to the overall satisfaction of this full-bodied beauty."
Horsepower,Syrah,95.0,117.14,7,"This exuberant wine oozes with delicious black cherry and blackberry flavors, delivered on a lively texture of fine-grained tannin and fresh acidity. On subsequent sips, a light toasty, meaty flavor drifts in, adding even more complexity and interest."
Hourglass,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,220.0,1,"Aromas steadily emerge on this bottling of mountaintop grapes, with golden apple oil, condensed honeysuckles, lemon bars and dried mango slices showing the slightest hint of tropicality. The palate is equally deep, with soft white peach sliding into sea salt, dried apples and nut oil, all culminating in a warm, lengthy browned-butter finish."
Hourglass,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.25,150.0,4,"Vanilla, herb, pencil box and spice aromas are followed by sweet cherry flavors in this wine. Lightly tacky tannins provide support."
Hourglass,Merlot,93.0,75.0,1,"This wine offers lively citrus and moderate acidity—a simple dry expression of the variety that refreshes. Stainless-steel fermented, it's been aged in both stainless and neutral Burgundy oak, adding complexity around the seasonings of lemongrass and ginger."
Hourglass,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,40.0,2,"This blend of 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Malbec, 20% Petit Verdot, 12% Cabernet Franc and 12% Merlot is very approachable on the nose with blackberry and black-pepper aromas. The palate also offers the black fruit with a touch of purple flowers, but it is somewhat simple and weak, especially compared to this winery's other bottlings."
Housley's Century Oak,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,29.0,1,"Quite mellow on the nose, this blend of 58% Grenache Blanc, 38% Roussanne and 4% Viognier offers very light marzipan and fresh white-peach aromas. It's a very easy to quaff wine on the sip, with lemon-peel and apricot flavors."
Hovey,Barbera,91.0,26.0,1,"A leesy, textural, racy and refreshing Riesling, this is loaded with lime, grapefruit and melon flavors. There is a streak of gin-like botanicals as well, and a rich, resonant finish."
Hovey,Chardonnay,88.5,19.0,2,"This is 96% Merlot, with just a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon. Firm and focused, it sports a toasty nose, with rich blackberry and cherry fruit. The oak treatment brings in generous flavors of coffee and mocha."
Hovey,Petite Sirah,91.0,22.0,1,"This is notable for its complexity and stylish blend of grape, berry and bramble flavors. The fruit is matched with polished tannins, streaks of iron and earth, and a citrusy highlight."
Hovey,Tempranillo,90.5,24.0,2,"The 2008 vintage produced some truly outstanding red wines in Washington, if your palate runs to higher acid, bright fruit styles. This is a perfect example; it's loaded with raspberries, strawberries and pretty berry fruit aromas. The acids prop it up perfectly; it's front loaded but has the balance and tightness to cellar for a few years. But really—drink it young."
Hovey,Zinfandel,89.0,24.0,2,"A big burly Syrah from this Temecula producer whose goal it is to become the premier winery of Southern California, the wine is loaded with plummy black fruit and a peppery mouthfeel, its oakiness derived from the almost three years it spent barrel-aging in new French oak. Not for the meek at 15.6% alcohol, it finishes a tad sweet."
Howell Mountain Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,75.0,1,"Eight vineyards and six grapes go into this table red; in some vintages this hits the mark, as it does here. It has just enough flesh to plump out the blackberry and black cherry fruit; and the tannins are polished, with hints of licorice and coffee."
Howell Mountain Vineyards,Zinfandel,89.4,49.0,5,"This is a carefully made, almost calculated wine that showcases controlled herbaceousness around tight, crisp black fruits. The mix evokes earth, herb, barrel and grape."
Hudson Vineyards,Cabernet Franc-Merlot,93.0,125.0,1,"A flood of delicious, sweet/sour floral and citrus flavors sweeps across the palate, a lush compound of satsuma orange and highlights of honeysuckle, Meyer lemon and apricot. It's a tart and vivid wine, with lovely concentration and no rough edges."
Hudson Vineyards,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,39.0,1,"Now a strong focus for the Tranche estate, this is inky purple/black in the glass, almost impenetrable, and lushly aromatic with dried berries, plums and cherries. A generous vein of vanilla and tobacco—from 28 months in French oak—leads into chewy, ripe tannins."
Hudson-Chatham,Red Blend,83.0,22.0,1,"Sestina celebrates old-vine Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc from the Red Willow and Bacchus vineyards. The initial punch and power gives way to a wine with sharp acidity and somewhat constrained, leafy fruit flavors. For those who crave old-vine complexity and embrace the herbal side of Cabernet, this wine will be a revelation. Tight and focused, it responds well to several hours of decanting."
Hug,Chardonnay,87.0,32.0,2,"This four-grape, Bordeaux-style blend offers firm, concentrated plum and cassis fruit, stiff tannins and a touch of iron and graphite. It saw 45% new French oak—pretty impressive for a $25 red."
Hug,Pinot Noir,93.67,46.0,3,"Viognier is half the blend, with the rest Roussanne and Riesling, yielding a delightfully aromatic, lightly honeyed wine, with a lush array of ripe fruits. Apricot, papaya, pineapple and banana are all here, with supporting acidity. Overall, this is one of the most delicious and unique white wines in Washington."
Hug,Syrah,93.5,49.0,2,"Very little of this reserve was produced in 2011. A blend from five vineyards, it spent 10 months in 43% new oak. Firm and a bit steely, it has tight dark fruits anchored in a streak of earth and iron. Give it a few more years in the bottle, or decant if drinking it soon."
Hullabaloo,Zinfandel,87.0,16.0,1,"This is a toasty, tasty, forward and easy-drinking Pinot Noir. Flavors of black cherry soda, cola and light toast are front and center, and the finish comes on clean and refreshing."
Hundred Suns,Pinot Noir,88.0,28.0,2,"Tight and tart, this is packed with concentrated, high-acid flavors of cranberry and raspberry. The wine is young and fresh, with both grip and depth, and should age nicely through 2019–2021."
Hunnicutt,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,100.0,1,"A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay aromatically suggestive of candied fruit and dried apricot, it offers a healthy dose of minerality amidst a well-composed structure. Striking the right balance between fleshy and firm, it'll go well with just about anything."
Hunnicutt,Red Blend,92.0,45.0,1,"This is a serious red wine, from its opaque, inky color to the dark cherry, freshly turned dirt and crushed herb aromas. The extra-long finish is preceded by a smooth mouthfeel with expertly integrated tannins. However, the black fruits are not quite as dazzling on the palate as the scents are on the nose."
Hunnicutt,Zinfandel,88.0,48.0,2,"This 77% Petite Sirah has 23% Syrah blended into it, the result entirely satisfying with a rich full nose of dark berries and chocolate and spicy plum, the tannins a touch dusty in taste. This wine would be delicious with a meaty pizza or lasagna layered with meat and cheese."
Hunt & Ryde,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,75.0,1,"Impressive for a $12 Old Vine Zin, this wine is spicy and full of pepper, much more savory than sweet with plenty of texture midpalate and decent length. Definitely full-bodied, it'll stand up to a plethora of rich foods and even age another couple of years."
Hunt & Ryde,Pinot Noir,91.0,50.0,1,"A rich, full Petite Sirah with a taste of cola and spice followed by ripe raspberry and blackberry. A very yummy version of the variety from one of Livemore's most promising vineyards."
Hunt & Ryde,Zinfandel,92.0,40.0,1,"In comparison with the 2008 Cabernet, this is the bigger wine, less sleek, more chewy. As it opens in the glass, the aromas display incense scents, and there is assertive, blocky, chewy fruit––especially black cherry. The tannins are also bigger, blockier, more substantial than the Cabernet. With hours of breathing time, exotic spices (saffron and more) emerge."
Hunt Cellars,Barbera,88.0,62.0,1,"Gilles Nicault, who oversees the Long Shadows portfolio, makes this pure Cabernet. If this had a Napa Valley label on it, it could sell for three times the price. The structure is full and fleshy, but with the vividly bright fruit that screams Washington State. Juicy acidity underscores the berries, cherries and plums; the generously applied new oak adds texture and layers of caramel, coconut and chocolate. A bottle that belongs with Washington's (and California's) best."
Hunt Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,75.0,1,"Seductive and complex, the inviting aromas mix incense, blueberries, cassis, licorice and threads of herb and graphite. Flavors are wrapped tightly and unfold gracefully through a long finish. The herbal side of Cabernet is noted without being intrusive. Classic, deep and expressive."
Hunt Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.67,75.0,3,"This is the first wine to be blended each year, though it is not labeled a reserve. The new vintage has amazing depth, running down through a litany of red and black fruits, into veins of earth and tannin and graphite, and finishing with densely textured barrel notes of toast, coffee and bitter chocolate. Beautifully proportioned, deep and cellarworthy."
Hunt Cellars,Chardonnay,88.0,37.0,1,"Gréine is a blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah, with a splash of Viognier. Earthy and herbal, it shows little sign of ripe fruit, and whiffs of pickle barrel come through some jarring flavors of vanilla. Perhaps more bottle time will help to knit this wine together."
Hunt Cellars,Merlot,88.0,45.0,1,"This is barrel-fermented in one-third new French oak. The fruit is perfectly ripe, clean and expansive, running from apple into light tropical flavors. There are light hints of honey and caramel, but, as usual, the fruit is front and center, and the barrels play a supporting role. Previous vintages of this wine have proven to be ageworthy, with a prime drinking window from 2020–2022."
Hunt Cellars,Pinot Noir,88.0,60.0,1,"Big and bold, this emphasizes flavor impact. Attractively deep in hue, it stays ruby-colored and fresh-looking at the rim. An oak influence shows in the vivid vanilla and light maple syrup aromas and carries over to the flavors that show a vein of ripe berry fruit, too. Full bodied and velvety in texture, it has ample tannins that help carry flavors to the finish."
Hunt Cellars,Red Blend,89.5,49.0,2,"Rich but subtle, this medium-bodied wine is not overtly fruity or oaky, but blends complex nuances in an attractive and compelling way. The term “battonage” refers to stirring the lees while the wine ages in barrels or tanks, which can enhance the creamy texture. It smells like vanilla and nutmeg, and tastes creamy and buttery backed by ripe apple and a touch of lemon. It feels rich in texture, elegant rather than bold."
Hunt Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,85.0,50.0,1,"Bold and ripe in taste, this full-bodied wine packs in plump blackberry and boysenberry flavors, a rich texture from firm tannins and lip-smacking acidity that keeps it lively. Slow-cooked ribs, anyone?"
Hunt Cellars,Zinfandel,88.0,50.0,1,"Smooth and harmonious are good descriptors for this medium-bodied, warmly fruity and well-balanced wine. It smells like plums and cherry compote, tastes substantive with more cherries and plums, and feels rich but well supported by fine tannins and subtle acidity."
Hunt Country Vineyards,Riesling,87.0,10.0,1,"There's the slightest touch of sourdough-like yeast on the nose of this wine from the longtime organic vineyard. That gives intrigue to the ripe watermelon, bubblegum and buttery cherry aromas. Verve on the palate conveys red fruit cut by a rain-on-cement minerality."
Hunt McKay,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,125.0,1,"A sweet, high-fueled blend of Chardonnay, Muscat Blanc and old-vine Trebbiano from a newly approved appellation called the Sierra Pelona Valley, north of Los Angeles, this wine has peach and lemon peel hiding behind a lathering of oak."
Hunter DeHaven,Red Blend,91.0,25.0,1,"A brawny, cherry flavored Zinfandel, big shouldered all around with dense, leathery spicy aromas and flavors, with hints of licorice and bittersweet chocolate. Estate bottled and grown in Napa's Chiles Valley."
Hyatt,Black Muscat,92.0,25.0,1,"Viticulturalist Ann Kraemer, who farms Shake Ridge Vineyards for many other producers, keeps some of the grapes for Yorba, her label with winemaker Ken Bernards of Ancien. The result is an exceptionally good dark plum, black cherry and blackberry-tinged Syrah with pepper and meat thread throughout the deep fruit concentration of this still-tight, mountain-grown wine. Cellar another 2–5 years."
Hyatt,Chardonnay,87.0,18.0,1,"Deep purple, this riveting Malbec melds dark red and blue fruits to the grip and texture of ripe Yakima Valley tannins. Think clean earth lightly dusted with chocolate, and you have the finish. A powerful wine with excellent cellar potential."
Hyatt,Merlot,85.0,19.0,1,"Can Washington Mourvèdre really be this good? From the Far Away Vineyard (previously named for owner Art den Hoed) it sure can. Sappy and fresh, this lively wine features ripe red fruits, sharp acids and smooth tannins, with toasted walnuts and caramel streaking through the finish. It shows excellent concentration and length."
Hyatt,Riesling,88.0,30.0,1,"This is an intriguing wine, with notes of dried sage, fresh herbs, mineral and black tea. The palate offers sweet, dense, layered vanilla, clove and cherry flavors backed by dry tannins. Still young, this wine needs extended time in the cellar to be properly appreciated. Best after 2022."
Hyatt,Syrah,83.0,18.0,1,"This wine displays aromas of tobacco, cracked black pepper, clove and mineral. It's elegant in style with tart fruit flavors and lightly chalky tannins."
Hyde de Villaine,Chardonnay,94.0,68.0,1,"This wine offers aromas of mocha powder, red apple, dark raspberries and woodspice. The red fruit flavors are quite sweet and concentrated, backed by a dry lick of tannins."
Hyde de Villaine,Pinot Noir,93.0,116.0,1,"Some may find this too cool-climate for the grape, but the green peppercorns, fresh-crushed thyme, dried parsley and papilla chile aromas prove remarkably pleasant and inviting. The herbs extend to the palate, which is leveled by red cherry and blueberry fruits, some slate and turned earth, and rustic elderberry jam. It has great density."
Hyland,Gewürztraminer,90.0,25.0,1,"This very fairly priced Merlot from the Cosumnes River sub-section of Lodi has a juicy berry roundness that makes it inviting to drink, and softly textured all around. On the long finish is a remarkably vibrant strain of caramel-mocha flavor, and interesting secondary notes that may have developed over time on this 2007 vintage."
Hyland,Pinot Noir,91.53,72.87,15,"A tempting, well-balanced wine from a tiny artisan winery, this is medium bodied but packs in a great array of ripe fruit and dark chocolate flavors. Firm tannins and acidity lift it and keep it lively through the finish. It tastes great now but will improve through 2020."
Hyland,Riesling,92.0,25.0,1,"From a vineyard farmed by Ted Klopp of Klopp Ranch, this is a light, spicy vineyard-designate, silky smooth in crisp red cherry and berry. A streak of fresh-picked herb overlays the soft wine, which finishes with a taste of wet stone-like minerality."
I'M,Pinot Noir,88.0,35.0,1,"Concentrated violet aromas mix with dark blackberry and even blueberry fruit in this blend of 46% Syrah, 45% Grenache and 9% Petite Sirah, yet it remains quite fresh on the nose. The palate shows hibiscus, more aromatic blueberry elements and touches of cassis and vanilla."
II Moons,Chenin Blanc,87.0,24.0,1,"Finished dry, this combines elements of orange peel and citrus in a simple refreshing style."
II Moons,G-S-M,92.0,45.0,1,Chocolate-covered strawberry meets rich brown sugar and cola notes in this medium-bodied wine that's moderately structured and round. It finishes in a plume of subtle smoky oak.
II Moons,Rhône-style Red Blend,94.0,40.0,1,"Candied apple, cantaloupe, plumeria and bubblegum touches show on the nose of this ripe blend of 39% Marsanne, 38% Roussanne and 23% Grenache Blanc. There are strong tropical notes on the palate, including guava, coconut oil and tuberose flavors."
II Moons,Rhône-style White Blend,92.0,28.0,1,"Cedar and resin notes rise to the fore in this full-bodied wine that's basic and hearty, with blackberry and dried herb flavors."
Ibarra,Chardonnay,88.0,36.0,1,"This is a big, bold blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Petite Sirah and 15% Zinfandel that persists in thick, dense tannin and leather and tobacco notes. Full of juicy black fruit and subtle cinnamon and pepper, it finishes clean."
Ibarra,Grenache,92.0,42.0,1,"This is a big-boned, dusty varietal wine, aged in 50% new French oak. Oak spice scents enwrap its leathery blackberry and black currant flavors, finishing on a bittersweet taste of tobacco."
Ibarra,Petite Sirah,87.0,34.0,1,"Crisp golden apple and pear meet toasted oak in both aroma and flavor in this simply structured, light-bodied white. While it remains crisp and mineral-driven on the midpalate, it lacks complexity on the finish, getting to its point succinctly."
Ibarra,Roussanne,90.0,28.0,2,"Structured with firm, sticky tannin, this wine is built to age and impress over time, dusted with mocha and spicy black cherry flavor. Moderate in oak, it strikes a balance between its fruit and savory elements, softening in the glass."
Ideology,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,56.5,2,"Toasted nut, yellow melon, pear and struck match scents show on the nose of this bottling from a steep, rocky vineyard in the mountains between Malibu and the Conejo Valley. It's tightly wound on the palate, with a core of pear, apple and nectarine flesh, accented with sea salt and oak smoke flavors."
Ideology,Chardonnay,87.0,32.5,2,"Appealing aromas of cocoa, herb, cherry and barrel spice lead to full fruit flavors. Burly slightly drying tannins give it a firm squeeze."
Ideology,Pinot Noir,87.0,55.0,1,"This blends 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot into a tightly woven package of red fruit, soft tannin and robust concentration. Full bodied, it shows the warmth and distinct power of the vintage."
Ideology,Rosé,88.0,25.0,1,"This is 96% Cabernet Sauvignon, with an addition of Syrah. Fully ripe, bold and assertive, this high-octane wine holds its alcohol well. Muscular and powerful, it has black cherry and cassis flavors that saturated with baking spice, chocolate, cedar and coffee notes. This is well supported by acids and is matched to perfectly ripe tannins."
Ideology,Syrah,88.0,40.0,1,"A Southern Rhône-style blend of 62% Grenache, 31% Cinsault and 7% Syrah, this is loaded with flavors of wild herb and bright berry. From the Cinsault comes a hint of mushroom, while the Syrah lends muscle and peppery fruit. This has excellent concentration, complex flavors and appealing length."
Ideology Cellars,Pinot Noir,82.0,48.0,1,"A fresh and textural wine, this puts a spicy spin on citrus rind, peach and apricot flavors. There's an intriguing hint of white pepper as well, and an overall sensation of density, intensity and exceptional length."
Ideology Cellars,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,80.0,36.0,1,"Thoughtfully made and sourced from two excellent vineyards—Walla Walla's Seven Hills and Canoe Ridge in the Horse Heaven Hills American Viticultural Area—this is 75% Merlot, with smaller portions of Petit Verdot and Malbec. Black cherry, black olive, clean earth and fine tannins mark its passage across the palate. This has excellent balance and medium-term ageability."
Idilico,Graciano,92.0,30.0,1,"This lively and flavorful wine has a light copper color, lean and fresh cherry and plum flavors, a rich mousse of bubbles and clean, tangy finish. It's a great example of a rosé that doesn't overdo it."
Idylwood,Pinot Noir,86.0,25.0,1,"Intriguing notes of honey, poached pear, apple with drizzled caramel and a light touch of marzipan show on the nose on this bottling that leans somewhat sweet in aromas. But the sip is dry, with Asian pear, jasmine and honeysuckle elements, quite crisp and engaging for the palate on multiple levels."
Illahe,Grüner Veltliner,85.0,15.0,1,"Blended with 13% Syrah, this wine opens with notes of cassis, smoke, sweet herb, vanilla and tar. The black-fruit flavors are full bodied but still retain a sense of vibrancy and deftness. The finish stretches out and the tannins provide some chew."
Illahe,Pinot Gris,87.5,15.0,2,"A solid and nuanced sip of this varietal for a fair price, this bottling of older vines from Paso's eastern flanks shows plump elderberry and cedar on the elegant nose. A smoked-chocolate flavor hits the palate, bolstered by blackberry syrup, white pepper, bay leaf and dried basil, with plenty of both tannin and acid."
Illahe,Pinot Noir,89.67,36.67,3,"Reserved on the nose at first, this wine eventually releases pressed black raspberry and elderberry fruit as well as a peppery teriyaki element. Similar fresh fruit shows on the palate, enhanced by anise, dried sage and other aromatic herbs."
Ilsley,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,77.5,2,"The second of the producer's estate Syrahs, this one planted in Altamont soils, this full-bodied beauty shows juicy acidity in support of blackberry, blueberry and black licorice. Compost and tea provide an earthy underside, as the finish grips in leather."
Imagery,Lagrein,86.0,45.0,1,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of orange peel, mineral, raspberry and cranberry. The palate is flavorful yet reserved with a lingering fruit-filled finish."
Imagery,Riesling,91.0,26.0,1,"This delicious wine smells very fresh, like putting your nose into a fruit salad. It tastes more dry, like lemons and crisp apples. Medium bodied, it offers good acidity and appetizing balance."
Imagery,Viognier,89.0,29.0,1,"Aromas of coffee, dried herbs, vanilla, flowers and cherry lead to ripe, full-bodied fruit flavors. The silky feel and lengthy finish only adds to the enjoyment."
Imagery,White Blend,90.5,28.0,2,"This is a full-bodied and extroverted wine. It smells like melted butter and baking spices and tastes like nougat and caramel with just a touch of sweetness. Oaky in a moderate way, it offers great citrus and pineapple on the midpalate and a lingering finish."
Imagination Wines,Zinfandel,88.0,25.0,1,"Exotic yellow-spice notes meet with lean lime pith on the light and crisp nose of this old-vine expression from a historic winery. Meyer-lemon rind and juice show brightly on the palate, where grippy chalkiness complements rich lemon-curd flavors."
In Re,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.5,65.0,2,"Aromas of finely ground black pepper, green herbs, orange peel and cherry are followed by tart, soft, sumptuous cranberry and savory flavors. The finish extends into the distance. It's all about feel and focus."
Inception,Viognier,86.0,30.0,1,"From one of the few producers to have estate-grown Syrah in the appellation, this wine comes from vines planted in Goldridge soils. It offers robust notions of tangy red fruit, leathery pepper and wild game, a worthy representative of the variety that could stand more time in bottle. Drink now through 2020."
Inconceivable,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.5,25.0,2,"Argyle's reserve shows more barrel flavor than the regular Willamette Valley bottling, highlighting an interesting mix of Asian spice and coffee. But the tannins are oddly absent; there seems to be a bit of a hole in the back of the wine. It opens beautifully, then hits a dead spot. A good wine, but missing something."
Inconceivable,Chardonnay,87.0,25.0,1,"This is quite light, almost ephemeral, with tart raspberry and red licorice flavors and a strong metallic/mineral streak. It is delicately made, and interesting, but comparable to a simple Bourgogne rather than a wine priced at this level."
Inconceivable,Pinot Noir,86.5,25.0,2,"Pierre Léon is a selection of different clones from the winery estate. Maybe it's the vintage, but the wine seems dilute. The flavors of tart wild berry, earth and herb have a thin, edgy character; and the tannins seem greener than what would be optimal."
Indigené,Pinot Noir,92.0,31.0,2,"This is a chunky, blocky, rather stolid take on what is usually a floral, perfumed grape. Here it is limited to thick fruit components —orange and guava—tart acids and some residual sweetness."
Indigené,Red Blend,88.0,21.0,3,"From a head-trained, dry-farmed vineyard, this very delicate and rather light bottling shows minerally lava rock and riverstone aromas, tart red-cherry fruit and a touch of chaparral. The palate's light structure offers rust and red cherry flavors."
Indigené,Riesling,84.0,13.0,1,"Raspberry fruit shines through with ample backing acidity. The flavors are true and fresh, though the wine seems to thin out midpalate. It was fermented with wild yeast and aged for 15 months in the barrel."
Indigené,Sauvignon Blanc,84.0,18.0,1,"Dark in color and viscous in texture, this wine shows dried plum, concentrated blueberry, cola, licorice and kirsch on the nose. It's powerfully flavored on the palate, with cooked cherry and mulberry fruit, as well as vanilla and ginger spice. It will be exciting to see what the new winemaking and ownership team does with this iconic estate."
Indigené,Syrah,88.0,28.0,1,"This almost-opaque bottling from the Hidden Valley Vineyard unleashes a powerful wave of aromas, from concentrated blueberry to licorice and vanilla to plum sauce. Cassis flavors permeate the dense palate, feeling lavish and nearly over-the-top."
Inglenook,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.67,165.0,3,"From a vineyard above Santa Paula, this bottling shows black plum, underripe berry and cedar touches on the nose. Tart black fruit marks the palate, lifted by dried lilac elements and lava rock minerality, all held together by upright tannins. Persistent acidity leaves the mouth zinging."
Inglenook,Rhône-style White Blend,91.0,52.5,2,"Intriguing red currant, elderberry, pepper and thyme aromas show in this blend of 63% Tempranillo, 15% Grenache, 14% Carignane and 8% Graciano that was aged in both French and American oak. The palate offers smoke, leather, sagebrush and thyme touches, bolstering its simple red fruit base."
Inman Family,Pinot Noir,91.56,48.44,9,"A dark and concentrated sandalwood aroma hits the nose on this bottling from west of Paso, alongside strawberries, red currants, smoked meats and a gravelly rockiness. Licorice, anise and fennel drive the palate, which opens up toward concentrated violets, plum fruit and pencil-lead flavors."
Inspiration,Zinfandel,93.0,50.0,1,"Beautifully balanced and elegant, this is made by one of the winemakers at Cardinale and inspired by the Loire Valley. It offers equal parts fruit, weight and minerality, tasting of fresh-squeezed lime and wet stone, with a layering of viscous vanilla. Medium-sized in terms of texture, it dances on the palate, refreshing throughout."
Iota Cellars,Pinot Noir,89.33,39.33,3,A balance of blueberry-chiffon ripeness and asphalt tightness is enhanced by spearmint and cola notes on the nose of this blend from eastern Santa Ynez Valley. The palate shows generous black fruit against a restrained tannic frame of tobacco and cedar.
Iris Vineyards,Chardonnay,88.67,25.33,3,"It's too bad that this blend of 75% Zinfandel, 12% Cabernet Franc and 13% Syrah is only found in Bermuda. Elderberry, tobacco and blueberry-stuffed chocolate power the dense nose, yet the palate shows a fresh lightness, with mint and menthol lifting the cherry juice and tannic grip that structures the sip."
Iris Vineyards,Merlot,88.0,24.0,1,"Dense and luxurious aromas of oak-laden red currants, blueberry, peppercorns and melted dark chocolate greet the nose on this hearty bottling. The flavors are lighter than the nose suggests, yet the silky texture evolves quickly to deliver plenty of espresso bean, vanilla, blueberry and blackberry elements, all clinging to a strong tannic structure."
Iris Vineyards,Pinot Gris,90.33,22.0,3,"This ripe but fresh blend of 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Syrah and 32% Petite Sirah shows blackberry-blueberry syrup as well as cedar and smoked pork on the nose. The palate offers rich and tasty flavors of olallieberry pie cut by a graphite-driven minerality."
Iris Vineyards,Pinot Noir,90.2,40.4,5,"The nose of this excellently priced wine offers sour fruit from Montmorency cherries, earthiness from squeezed beets, spice from toasted sagebrush and umami from soy sauce. The palate is deep, with a sanguine character that's enhanced by lots of cracked pepper. It delivers plenty of action for the price."
Iris Vineyards,Syrah,88.0,24.0,2,"Roasted beets and beef aromas combine with scarlet-red rose petals, peppercorns, black clove, cinnamon and nutmeg on the nose of this wine. The palate offers more cinnamon and purple flowers, with herbal lift from thyme as well as a solidly structurd frame that ensures this bottle will last quite a while."
Iris Vineyards,Tempranillo,89.0,28.0,1,"Intoxicating aromas of plum jelly, violets, blueberry, chocolate and cinnamon are cut with a pencil-lead focus on this bottling by a family in the Paso wine game since 1908. Flavors of blackberry jelly are lifted by lavender and anise spice."
Iron Horse,Chardonnay,91.3,39.5,10,"An inviting nose of buttery stewed cherries and red currants grows even more delicious thanks to smoked pork and a black-slate minerality. It's not quite so boisterous on the palate, but it features lovely cherry-pie notes, a slight orange-peel tang, some eucalyptus and a clean finish."
Iron Horse,Pinot Noir,91.16,79.47,19,"Made from all free-run juice with no oak, this wine by 40-year veteran Frederic Brander shows candied lemon and lime peels on the approachable, inviting nose, along with fresh-cut apples and a growing passionfruit perfume. The passionfruit tang also shows on the palate alongside ripe limes and a lingering grassy note, held together by grippy acidity and pithy texture."
Iron Horse,Sparkling Blend,92.95,60.48,21,"The 33% Semillion shows strongly in this Bordeaux-style blend, with the rest Sauvignon Blanc. Toasted Marcona almonds, preserved lemons, dried limes, iodine and walnut oil greet the nose. The nut-oil character is laced throughout the palate, with dried yellow fruits and a touch of earthiness. It's fresh yet creamy, and perfect for a wide range of cheeses."
Iron Hub,Chardonnay,90.0,27.0,2,"Now officially labeled from the newly named Malibu Coast appellation, this bottling shows lots of potential for the region. Aromas of lush lemonade, crushed vanilla, browned butter, honeysuckle and honey lead into a soft and lush palate that's buttery but high-toned. Flavors of toasted bread with orange marmalade prove warm but tartly dynamic."
Iron Hub,Grenache,89.0,25.0,1,"Mineral, mulberry, dried herb and black-fruit aromas lead to layered dark-fruit flavors that show intensity as well as exceptional balance. This has a delicious factor that is impossible to ignore."
Iron Hub,Zinfandel,86.0,30.0,2,"This is dry, crisp and nicely detailed, with a persistent, clean and fresh mouthfeel. Notes of cucumber, salad greens and citrus, notably lime and grapefruit, are underscored with appealing minerality. This remains one of the highlights of Chehalem's expansive portfolio."
Ironstone,Cabernet Franc,87.5,20.0,2,"The aromatic intensity takes you quickly to the signature heart of the grape. It's floral and spicy, leading to concentrated flavors of citrus and stone fruits. It's ripe, dry and penetrating."
Ironstone,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,47.5,2,"The aromatics suggest rose petals, while the tart fruit flavors run to raspberries and citrus. The freshness and complexity hint at further improvement over the next three to five years."
Ironstone,Chardonnay,87.0,20.0,2,"This cuvée has the prettiest aromatics of the entire 2012 lineup, highlighted with rose petals and spice. Apples and cranberries are the fruit components, amped up with stiff acidity. It finishes with a faint touch of chocolate."
Ironstone,Malbec,88.0,20.0,1,"This limited-production wine was fermented in a 500 liter French oak puncheon and put through full malolactic. The mouthfeel is creamy and the wine balanced, with buttery highlights around jicama and green-apple fruit. Despite the low alcohol, it's ripe enough to feel full bodied."
Ironstone,Meritage,89.0,40.0,1,"This is one of those kitchen sink blends that is better than it has a right to be. Riesling, Pinot Blanc, Muscat, Gewürztraminer and Pinot Gris are all in the mix, and the wine is both aromatic and packed with fresh flavors of bubble gum and tropical fruit candy. It's finished dry, yielding a multipurpose, unique white wine that you may try with just about any food you'd put in front of any of the component grapes."
Ironstone,Red Blend,85.0,15.0,2,"Three Sixty comes from four blocks of the Bucher Vineyard, planted to a range of clones. Made in small amounts, it offers a wealth and breadth of black cherry, vanilla and smoky oak, the tannins softened and well integrated into the whole. It takes on savory aspects of coffee and clove as it opens."
Ironstone,Symphony,88.0,12.0,2,"John Kinney is doing great things with Livermore Valley fruit, most especially with many of his whites, including this classically oaked Fumé Blanc, the grapes barrel-fermented in 100% French oak (Seguin Moreau and Taransaud) and left sur lie for six months, Montrachet style. Creamy but bright with aromatics of caramel and vanilla, but only 50 cases were made."
Ironstone,Viognier,86.0,20.0,1,"From the family's westernmost vineyard, this bottling is fabulously complex. It shows dense dried fruit and turned earth aromas, along with chaparral, smoke, clove and nutmeg. Those wild elements figure strongly on the sip, which shows thyme, rosemary and sagebrush accents around a core of plum, pomegranate and hibiscus flavors. A vanilla flair graces the finish."
Ironstone,Zinfandel,88.17,20.67,6,"Juicy black cherry, tar and leather notes provide flavor and heft in this supple wine with sizable yet well-behaved tannins. Its firm structure balances the full body, as clove and just-roasted coffee highlights linger on the finish."
Irony,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.33,16.0,3,"Vinified in neutral French oak puncheons, this luscious wine offers a lively mix of papaya, mango, vanilla and butterscotch flavors. Though rich, it's never tiring, and firms up midpalate into a wine with some muscle through the finish. Enjoy through 2025."
Irony,Chardonnay,87.33,14.0,3,"This is another fantastic vintage of this Zinfandel, blended smaller amounts of Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah. It offers a wealth of soft, juicy milk chocolate and cherry pie character and is high in acidity and dusty tannin. A beautiful, memorable testament to what this variety can be."
Irony,Pinot Noir,86.0,16.0,2,"As it opens, this wine's ever-so-slightly-dried black-cherry aroma emerges with elegance and power, alongside unending layers of potpourri, crushed flowers, juniper and dark spice. The palate leads with a tart cranberry note that broadens into a warmer strawberry flavor, laced together with tingling acidity and sagebrush spice."
Irvine Family Vineyards,Chardonnay,87.0,29.0,1,"Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard, this is a supple, soft wine, with refined tannins. A zippy nose of rose and spice scents paves the way for more powerful leather saddle, cedar and black tea elements. Its fruit is wild and brambly, recalling blackberry and dark cherry with enviable succulence."
Irvine Family Vineyards,Pinot Noir,87.0,35.0,1,"Almost decadently rich, this seduces with aromas of toasted hazelnuts, buttery stone fruits and sweet sliced pineapple. In perfect balance and drinking beautifully, it should remain at its peak through the mid-2020s."
Irwin Family Vineyards,Red Blend,88.5,18.5,4,"Juicy dark-purple fruits hold the center of this supple, engaging wine that's still young, with chewy tannins. There's tangy bite to the acids and plenty of muscle for aging. Drink 2020 through 2030 and possibly longer."
Irwin Family Vineyards,Tempranillo,91.0,28.0,1,"From a vineyard at 1,100 feet elevation in the southern part of the appellation, this bottling shows light and lively raspberry, plum, white pepper, fennel and damp herb aromas. The palate abounds with red fruit, well-woven acidity and layers of herbs. A raspberry jam note pops on the finish."
Isabel Mondavi,Pinot Noir,87.5,45.0,2,"Earthy forest floor and sage notes make for a savory experience in this otherwise juicy wine. Robust, full-bodied and concentrated, it offers developed flavors of baked plum, strawberry and rhubarb compote, the fruit edged with menthol."
Isenhower,Red Blend,90.0,28.0,1,"Single vineyard Zinfandel from a young vineyard on the Columbia River, this is pretty rather than powerful, smooth and chocolaty, with bright, tight raspberry fruit."
J & J,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,40.0,2,"Made from 100% Grenache grapes, it was made in a tiny amount of 50 cases. It offers an almost grenadine-like flavor amidst a core of peach intensity. Softly textured, it's super enjoyable and would go well with a bowl of fruit, eggs and bacon at brunch."
J & J,Malbec,87.5,35.0,2,"Though it makes up only a fifth of the wine, Cabernet Sauvignon seems to win out in this largely Bordeaux-style blend with notes of mixed herbs, mint and green tea. Lighter in style, it offers a fresh feel, slightly chalky tannins, and little obvious new oak influence. It adds up to a low-alcohol wine that goes down easy."
J & J,Merlot,88.0,40.0,1,"Whether it's the vintage, or simply the evolution of winemaking at this new winery, this reserve Chardonnay is more restrained and structured than past efforts. Still young and compact, it shows succulent green apple and white peach flavors along with toast and butterscotch."
J & J,Red Blend,88.0,19.0,1,"A benchmark style for Washington Riesling, this mixes stone and citrus fruits, adds highlights of wintergreen spice, hints of honeysuckle, lemon and tea, and finishes with some fruit sweetness, though the wine is essentially dry."
J & J,Riesling,87.5,14.5,2,"Moderately soft, loose-knit, and lightly herbal, this pure, single-vineyard Cabernet is a modest but charming effort with warm currant fruit. The aging in French and American oak shows a little too aggressively at the moment, so decant."
J & J,Syrah,91.0,30.0,2,"This well-structured effort is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it bears nuances of herb and briar. There is a balanced mix of plum and black cherry flavors that are wreathed in smoke and coffee notes, which resolve into firm but smooth tannins."
J Bell Cellars,Cabernet Franc,88.0,30.0,1,"The amount of alcohol in this Syrah has increased in 2010, which will appeal to some palates. The downside is the loss of texture and subtlety. Smooth and powerfully fruity, this hits with some chewy tannins, but it stops a bit short. More bottle age could certainly be a boon to this wine."
J Bell Cellars,Rosé,85.0,20.0,1,"Dusty and detailed, this pure Viognier incorporates notes of lemon-pepper; tart, fresh lemon pulp and rind; plus a hint of curry powder. This should make an interesting accompaniment to raw clams or oysters."
J Vineyards & Winery,Chardonnay,90.2,38.8,5,"Barbera, Sangiovese and Nebbiolo comprise the wine. Half of the grapes were air dried for three months, which is known as appassimento. The Sangiovese was crushed and fermented conventionally before being added to the blend. The result is a dry, slightly nutty red wine, with tart flavors that are suggestive of fruit leather. It shows good grip and length, and it comes with just a bit of alcoholic heat."
J Vineyards & Winery,Pinot Gris,90.0,34.0,1,"Upon opening, this intense, fragrant wine seems European in style, with Italian-like nuances of leather, fungus and tobacco. The enticing whiffs give way to a full-flavored palate that offers notes of mixed red fruits, while the finish loses some focus."
J Vineyards & Winery,Pinot Noir,91.25,58.44,16,"This could be labeled as Cabernet Franc, since it comprises 80% of the blend. The youthful lightness of the estate-grown grapes seems to lift the naturally tannic nature of the variety. It's clean and balanced, and it comes with an herbal underpinning. This is best for near-term drinking."
J Vineyards & Winery,Sparkling Blend,89.17,46.83,6,"It clocks in at an astonishing 15% alcohol, but does not show it in terms of flavor. The fruit is plenty ripe and a bit thick, but well-supported with acidity. Nonetheless the wine seems heavy and monolithic, having lost some of the vivid freshness of the other Chehalem white wines from this vintage."
J Wilkes,Pinot Blanc,89.0,30.0,2,"Light and pretty with watermelon and faint strawberry notes, Frisk is just slightly fizzy. Its aromas almost trick one into expecting a wine that's sweet, but it finishes dry and is in balance. Made from Grenache grapes, it's a likable, refreshing drink ready for the picnic basket or patio."
J Wrigley,Pinot Noir,87.0,41.5,2,"This is stiff and herbal, both in scents and flavors. There's a strong streak of earth dampening the light cranberry fruit. The aging in two third new French oak adds a bit of chocolate to the finish."
J. Bookwalter,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.67,58.33,6,"Winemaker Kathy Joseph delivers this seven-barrel ode to her father, who'd be proud of the tight blackberry, wet clay, shaved cedar and iron-rich aromas. The acidity is bountiful but not overpowering on the palate, where elderberry, dried lavender, wild mint and damp earth combine for a deep and lasting sip."
J. Bookwalter,Cabernet Franc,90.0,60.0,1,"This wine by retired baseball stars Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts shows both ripeness and restraint in all corners. On the nose, that means star anise and slate layered across black cherry and blackberry fruit. On the palate, the very full mouthfeel packs thyme, crushed herbs and elderberry flavors into an earthy package."
J. Bookwalter,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.18,48.64,11,"Produced from the oldest Pinot Noir vines in the Willamette Valley, this extraordinary wine is history in a bottle. Glorious aromatics offer intense scents of citrus, pine needle, pepper and berry, with flavors following. There's a welcome kick of citrus in the natural acidity, and this promises a long cellar life, as proven over and over again by this founding Oregon winery. Drink 2020 through 2040 and beyond."
J. Bookwalter,Chardonnay-Viognier,85.0,20.0,1,"The grapes for this beautiful wine come from a sloping, high-elevation site, coaxed into expression by Winemaker Bob Cabral. Barrel-aged 10 months in French oak, 40% of it new, it opens with touches of butter and matchstick before blowing off the doors with butterscotch, baked lemon and balanced, oaky spice. Voluptuous on the palate, this is a stunner."
J. Bookwalter,Chenin Blanc,86.0,26.0,1,"Light but tropical notes touch on the fluffy nose of this bottling, with papaya-laced marshmallow, pineapple meringue, lemon curd and a sea salt caramel touch. Chamomile, yellow apple skins, yellow flowers, tight mango and lots of saltiness show on the mouth-watering sip. The buttery character grows as it warms up, but it's delicious in all temperatures."
J. Bookwalter,Merlot,90.57,39.43,7,"Very tight and linear in all the right ways, this focused wine shows black raspberry, sweet hummingbird sage, clove butter and star anise on the nose. It's even lighter on the palate, where potpourri, olallieberry, black pepper and pencil lead converge. It will age gracefully, thanks to judicious acid and tannins. Drink 2018 through 2028."
J. Bookwalter,Red Blend,91.42,72.5,12,"Opening scents of cherry blossoms, fresh-picked cherries, and a dusting of powdered chocolate beckon further exploration. Complex and layered, this opens nicely into a full-flavored effort, with black cherry fruit, cola and a touch of dry earth and mushroom compost. The details and length are impressive. Drink now to 2030."
J. Bookwalter,Syrah,91.0,45.0,1,"This is the winery's reserve-level cuvée. It's bright and high-toned, offering woody notes around lush cherry and mocha flavors. Delicious already, though more bottle age should further pull the barrel flavors into proper balance. Toasted marshmallow and caramel latté highlights adorn the buttery finish."
J. Christopher,Chardonnay,90.5,21.0,2,"From a two-acre site at 1,110-feet elevation only five miles from the Pacific Ocean, this wine opens as if it were a lovely, expansive rose garden, so fragrant and intensely earthy. Built with sizable tannic structure and toasty oak, it features burly waves of spicy acidity and warm baking spices, exhibiting both tension and grace. Drink now through 2023."
J. Christopher,Pinot Noir,90.97,44.7,33,"The slightest touch of wildfire kicks off the nose, followed by aromas of hibiscus, light cranberry, dried rose petal, roasted pork shank and white pepper. It's quite light upon first sip, then a peppery intensity builds as flavors of underripe raspberry, fresh thyme and dewy oregano arise. For a lighter style of the grape, it's a classic, and stays fresh for days."
J. Davies,Cabernet Sauvignon,95.0,200.0,1,"Roasted peach, cinnamon and crushed vanilla bean make for an intriguing nose on another solid Talley bottling. It's soft and approachable at first, but then a bit brash and youthful, but will mellow with some patience. Drink 2017 onward."
J. Lohr,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.88,50.0,8,"Pleasant richness and depth of fruit flavor accompany the deep color and nicely chewy tannins in this full-bodied Cabernet. It tastes dry and well balanced between acidity, tannins and fruitiness, and will be a great mealtime wine with all kinds of protein."
J. Lohr,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.22,40.11,9,"Coming from the former owner of Domaine Alfred (now Chamisal Vineyards) this lip-smacking wine starts with a yeasty, Granny Smith apple nose. The flavors are tightly acidic yet plush at the same time: bitter apple skins mixing up with ripe pluots."
J. Lohr,Chardonnay,89.14,23.43,7,"Aromas of anise-laced blackberry candies emerge from this easy-drinking wine. Light and airy on the palate for such a rich-looking wine, it's redolent with flavors of cherries and fennel with a decent tannic backbone."
J. Lohr,G-S-M,90.0,30.0,2,"The nose on this secret blend is clean and tight, not showy at all, with just a touch of papaya and honey. It expands greatly on the palate with banana and melon, but wipes up quick with a fresh burst of acidity."
J. Lohr,Grenache,88.0,18.0,2,"Yeasty and fragrant with a fresh, wheat beer aspect, this delicate Riesling captures the gentle elegance of the grape's aromatics and mouthfeel. There's a nice mix of lemon tea, honey and mineral components, all in a low-alcohol but still quite dry style."
J. Lohr,Merlot,90.0,15.0,1,"Tropical-fruit aromas and lavish flavors go well with the richness and full body of this creamy-textured wine blended from Chardonnay, Sémillon and Verdelho grapes. Toasted almond, nutmeg and vanilla all come out on the palate and linger on the finish."
J. Lohr,Mourvèdre,87.0,30.0,1,"This is a bold, tannic, very flavorful wine that needs to pair with an epic meat dish. It smells like black cherry and cranberry, tastes almost chocolaty, and feels thick and dense with fine tannins and firm acidity."
J. Lohr,Petite Sirah,90.5,35.0,2,Aromas of roasted and green coffee beans lead to plush fruit and barrel flavors. It shows a fine sense of balance.
J. Lohr,Pinot Noir,89.86,24.71,7,"This blend of 60% Pinot Grigio and 40% Viognier offers sharp green-apple candy, lemongrass, candied lime and yellow lily on the fresh and attention-grabbing nose. Grassy tension on the palate highlights lime blossoms, kiwi and apple skins. The interplay between racy Pinot Grigio and riper Viognier is intriguing."
J. Lohr,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,17.0,1,Bright aromas of fresh flowers and orange rind lead to sweet fruit flavors. Enjoy it for dessert.
J. Lohr,Riesling,87.0,10.0,1,"A smoky aroma of plum-sauce-coated beef roast wafts on the nose of this lush bottling, which also offers white pepper and lilac. Plump berries and a fine-grained tannic structure consume the palate, finishing on a light caramel note."
J. Lohr,Sauvignon Blanc,88.8,18.0,5,"Jasmine, apricot and floral aromas are followed by medium-sweet stone-fruit flavors. Floral and jasmine flavors persist on the finish."
J. Lohr,Syrah,89.67,20.0,3,"Aromas of this medium-bodied, un-oaked wine suggest sliced pears and apples, while the flavors are equally fruity but have a leaner feel. The texture is dry, firm and crisp, making this a great pairing for shellfish and many other dishes."
J. Lohr,Valdiguié,87.0,10.0,2,"A firm, somewhat muscular wine, blending in 16% Merlot and aged in neutral oak barrels. Leaf and truffle notes abound, with the distinctively acidic underpinning of Sangiovese. Light strawberry-cherry fruit gently fades through a clean finish."
J. Lohr,Viognier,87.5,30.0,2,"Pleasantly fruity, with tart raspberry fruit, this easy, accessible Merlot from a single vineyard finishes with a light lick of toast."
J. Moss Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,70.0,3,"Cofermented with a splash of Viognier, this was aged in one-third new French oak. It's got a dose of the Syrah funk, with spice, a streak of wintergreen, and musky cherry fruit. It's interesting and nicely woven together, ready for near-term drinking."
J. Rickards,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,43.0,4,"A slightly darker shade of yellow, this wine from a historic vineyard offers preserved lemon, toasted almond and a doughy character on the nose. It's very tactile on the palate, clinging to the tongue strongly, showing flavors of stone fruit, mandarin pith and underripe tangerine juice."
J. Rickards,Carignane,90.0,28.0,1,"Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon make up the majority of this wine. Light aromas of herb, coffee bean and barrel spice lead to cranberry and cherry flavors that bring a lot of enjoyment."
J. Rickards,Malbec,90.0,30.0,2,"Fresh squeezed boysenberry and raspberry make for a lively fruit entry to the nose of this bottling by one of the area's more respected vineyard managers, who also packs some thyme, sagebrush and pine into the nose as well. Similar flavors pop on the fruity yet herbal palate, where snappy berry flavors meet with tarragon and mint."
J. Rickards,Red Blend,89.0,22.0,1,"A well-balanced mix of highlights: dried herbs, dusty cherry fruit, and a streak of citrus come together in this estate-grown wine. It finishes with a lick of caramel, from aging in 22% new oak."
J. Rickards,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,20.0,2,"This dark and brooding blend of 52% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 13% Petite Sirah, 7% Mourvèdre and 3% Tannat shows concentrated dark strawberry, meat char, white pepper and purple flowers on the nose. Those scents and varieties all come together in a savory show of roasting herbs and baked blackberry flavors on the plush palate."
J. Rickards,Sémillon,88.0,22.0,1,"Brooding aromas of vanilla, mocha and herb lead to a palate full of fresh acids and firm, but not unrelenting tannins. It's an intriguing example of the variety."
J. Rickards,Zinfandel,87.5,27.0,2,"Mourvèdre (82%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the balance equal parts Cinsault and Grenache. A blend of fruit from McKinley Springs and Upland vineyards, it offers aromas of white pepper, herb and earth that leads to sweet pure fruit flavors that linger."
J. Scott Cellars,Petite Sirah,91.0,24.0,1,"The 2011 Estate Selection brings flavors of rhubarb, citrus and tart raspberry, along with suggestions of pine needles and chocolate. It's well structured and proportionate—a good reflection of the vintage and Willamette Valley-style Pinot Noir."
J. Scott Cellars,Pinot Noir,89.75,33.0,4,"Tart and puckery, this is for acid-lovers. The aromas carry accents of pine needles, while the fruit is headlined with grapefruit and tangy citrus. Very refreshing."
J. Scott Cellars,Rosé,89.0,19.0,1,"The name comes from a Django tune, and also means “clouds” in French. Nothing cloudy here though—it's a pretty, lively, fruit-driven blend with cherry candy flavors. Crisp and fresh, a streak of cola runs comet-like through the tail, along with a hint of mint."
J. Scott Cellars,Syrah,87.0,23.0,1,"While thick and viscous with ripe blackberry and blueberry fruit, Musician's Zin is smooth in tannins and texture. Fruit dominates to the finish with a hit of characteristic pepper on the finish."
JAQK Cellars,Chardonnay,87.0,20.0,1,"In a classic combination of ripe flavors and lip-smacking structure, this full-bodied wine wraps concentrated black cherry and mint aromas and generous cherry and blackberry flavors in muscular tannins that keep the texture fresh."
JAQK Cellars,Pinot Noir,84.0,20.0,1,"This big and dry wine is a nice change of pace. The wine looks dark, smells deep and tastes full bodied and firm textured. It doesn't have the overripe or semisweet character of many Zins, but instead is rather tannic and even mildly astringent like strong tea, and has lip smacking cranberry and raspberry flavors."
JCB,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,186.67,3,"Minty cedar and red raspberry jam provide a freshness to this medium-built wine, subtle in spice and made in a soft, approachable style. Cherry and cinnamon round out the lengthy finish."
JCB,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,205.0,5,"Cedar, cherry, black olive, wet earth, green olive and freshly plucked plum pop on the nose of this bottling. The palate shows lots of ripe black cherry down the middle, but is surrounded by a tangy green olive and an underripe-berry character, whose tartness enlivens the mouth."
JCB,Chardonnay,88.0,55.0,2,"An earthy wine that offers complexity around a full-bodied juiciness of blackberry and bitter black tea, this is made in a big style and will appeal to fans of concentration and decisive use of oak."
JCB,Pinot Noir,89.75,63.75,4,"This wine is complex and deep in flavors, traditional in style and simply gorgeous to sip and savor. It's dry in style, good and tannic in texture, lightly spiced with cedar and cinnamon and grounded in concentrated raspberry and dark cherry flavors."
JCK Wine Company,Red Blend,87.0,35.0,1,"Made at an attractive price point, this wine delivers value and plenty of flavor, from blackberry jam to oak and black pepper. It's sturdy and structured, ready for the table or larger gathering."
JCK Wine Company,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,35.0,1,"Quince, lemon peel and honeydew make for compatible bedfellows in this no-oak white, which is light and inviting on the palate, with more underlying herbal flourishes than it first lets on. Dry and daring, it'll pair well with all manner of fresh seafood."
JCK Wine Company,Zinfandel,90.0,45.0,1,"One of the few in California to use this grape, winemaker Ryan Pease makes a great case for more in this bottling, which shows broad lemon curd, soft apple flesh and Anjou pear on the nose. There is ripe stone fruit on the tangy palate, but it's bone dry and grippy with chalky texture."
JCR,Pinot Noir,92.0,51.4,5,"A new offering made entirely from estate fruit, this is a selection of the best blocks and barrels of the vintage, with its core component being 90% Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon. The remainder is Zinfandel. Together they provide black color and a whiff of bay leaf and peppercorn, around well-integrated layers of black cherry, vanilla and black tea."
JLC,Merlot,92.0,36.0,1,"Renwood's tiny two-barrel production of its most expensive Zinfandel has aromas like vanilla and coconut and flavors as rich as milk chocolate and strawberry jam. This full-bodied wine is practically a liquid dessert, though it's not overly sweet. It's full-bodied, smooth and broad in texture."
JLC,Red Blend,89.0,22.0,1,"Tart, young and focused, this brings cranberry and black cherry fruit forward, with a lively, spicy mouthfeel. Flavors are battened down with bracing acidity and firm tannins. Give this an hour or more of breathing time, or decant."
JM Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,48.57,7,"There's a lot to admire in this robust wine, from its soft, muddled layers of spicy cinnamon to its well-hewn bursts of black licorice and blackberry. While full-bodied and brooding, it drinks with elegance and a brightness of red fruit on the finish."
JM Cellars,Cabernet Franc,92.0,50.0,1,"A handful of Cabernet Franc is included in this wine, which is full-bodied and quite robust, indicative of its mountain birth. While violet and rose florals accent dark cherry tastes, the tannin weight hints at meaty and spicy undertones."
JM Cellars,Carmenère,91.0,55.0,1,"From a former Kosta Browne winemaker comes this very dark Syrah, which shows still-wound-up aromas of elderberry, black coffee, white pepper and a touch of game. There are rich soy and beef notes once sipped, packaged by dense tannins and zesty acidity, with more elderberry, beef char and crushed slate emerging with time. Still young."
JM Cellars,Malbec,90.0,51.67,3,"Light and pleasant, with aromas mixing baked pears, citrus and honeycomb, this is really a lovely wine for the price. The fruit flavors follow consistently, pears and apples with a hint of citrus, clean and refreshing, with juicy acidity."
JM Cellars,Merlot,91.5,43.5,2,"This is exceptionally dark, with a sappy, vinous nose showing black cherry, smoke, sweet chocolate, some stem and a hint of dill. There is more than a hint of pickle barrel, and lots of acid, chalky tannins"
JM Cellars,Red Blend,89.57,37.43,7,"Some nice toasty flavors underscore generic fruit. When all is said and done, it is a neutral, crisp white wine enlivened with a bit of spice and toast from the barrel aging. Still, a bit of veggie/canned pea flavor dampens the finish."
JM Cellars,Syrah,91.6,47.2,5,"A proprietary Cab/Pinot/Nebbiolo blend. Flavors are light and the tannins are tough: a grapey, cherry-candy start that finishes with serious toast and tannin. The mid-palate simply isn't there, and can't support the thick, tannic finish."
Jack Creek,Chardonnay,90.0,36.0,1,"Cranberry, sour cherry, turned earth, dewy chaparral and anise aromas arise on this bottling from the historic Monterey producer. The mouthfeel is quite full, with sour cherries, leather, tobacco and mocha flavors cut by a judicious amount of acidity."
Jack Creek,Pinot Noir,89.0,36.0,1,"Aromas of blackberry syrup, black pepper, fresh fennel stalk and mint emerge from this wine, which comes from a five-acre vineyard in one of Monterey County's warmest appellations. Full, ripe flavors of black cherry, cola and licorice are cut by bright acidity and an appropriate tannic intensity."
Jack Nicklaus Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,63.0,1,"This is not necessarily a classic Grenache, but there is no denying its bold but sophisticated personality. Pomegranate and blackberry aromas are tinged with earthiness, and the flavors are rich in fruit as well. The texture is lush and the body is very full. Think of it as very ripe and delicious, while sleek and smooth in spite of high alcohol."
Jack Nicklaus Wines,White Blend,85.0,46.0,1,"This shows the excellent potential for this emerging grape in Southern Oregon. A mix of citrus, with the emphasis on orange and grapefruit, displays as much of the flavors of skin as flesh. The balance and length are in perfect proportion. Drink now through 2018."
Jackson Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,55.0,2,"The inaugural offering of this block-designate is dark and brooding, with tightly constructed, sizable tannins and oak still pronounced on the palate. Time should develop its floral notes of rose and orange peel, with accents of tea, cranberry and pomegranate. Cellar through 2017."
Jackson Estate,Chardonnay,90.0,30.0,1,"One of Mikael Sigouin's single-vineyard studies, this shows sandalwood, rose petals and juicy berries on the nose. It's ripe yet restrained on the palate, with plump red berries that pull back before being too juicy, with licorice spice and plum skin bitterness on the edges."
Jacob Franklin,Petite Sirah,90.0,75.0,1,"Dark pink and hearty, this is made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon grapes that spent six months fermenting in stainless steel. Balanced, it offers some heft on the midpalate before finishing crisp and bedazzled in cranberry and citrus."
Jacob Franklin,Red Blend,90.0,55.0,1,"If your tastes run to fruit-driven, all-stainless, crisp and steely Chardonnays, this is a great choice. Bright pineapple and citrus fruit flavors abound, and the acids, though substantial, are juicy and natural. The balance, freshness and overall value put this among best of class."
Jacob Williams,Cabernet Franc,87.0,35.0,2,"Elegant, yet still brimming in meaty tannins, this wine offers deftness on entry, diving deeper into blueberry cobbler and baked bread as it goes. On the nose, roses and cinnamon entice, while mid-weight oak and licorice pull in more savory directions. Ideal through 2021."
Jacob Williams,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,35.0,2,"Aromas of vanilla and baking spices take the lead, followed by dark fruit. The palate is all about texture, showing a creamy richness to the fruit and barrel flavors that linger. The oak plays a prominent role but it generally works."
Jacob Williams,Chardonnay,86.0,24.0,1,"Hailing from the winery's In the Rocks Vineyard, this wine opens with aromas of nori, black olive and blackberry that evolve into herb and plum. The dark fruit flavors are sweet and concentrated, lightly tacky in feel, backed by velvety-soft tannins."
Jacob Williams,Pinot Noir,84.0,28.0,1,"Slightly lighter than other takes on the grape, this wine shows hibiscus, black plum, grape soda and gravel on the nose. It's soft on the palate with red cherry, cranberry and dried strawberry fruit, balanced by dill and black pepper on the edges. Some sales proceeds go to a medical relief organization."
Jacob Williams,Red Blend,85.0,20.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon (42%) takes the lead with the rest equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of dried herbs, flowers, graphite and dark fruit lead to supple, layered dark fruit flavors back by the grip of dry tannins. Drink now."
Jacob Williams,Syrah,88.0,28.0,1,"Don't let the Red Wine label fool you. This is 92% Syrah with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon. It provides immediate appeal with its aromas of raspberry, plummy fruit, orange peel and chocolate. The palate has full-bodied, sumptuous flavors that linger. Drink now."
Jacob Williams,Zinfandel,85.0,35.0,1,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot starts out with aromas of dark coffee, toast, blackberry, fresh herbs and barrel spices (53% new French). It pulls no punches with rich blackberry and cherry flavors."
Jada Vineyard & Winery,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,54.0,4,"Already six years old, this is in full bloom, offering aromas of jammy red and black fruit sprinkled with cocoa and iron. Flavors show purity and richness, with barrel influences dialed back."
Jada Vineyard & Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.5,62.5,2,"An attractive array of cedar, cinnamon, red cherry and black currant aromas and flavors fill this medium-bodied wine to the rim. The acidity, tannins and flavors are all well proportioned and balance each other out in a sophisticated way. The result is an elegant but firm wine that will be appetizing at the table now through 2020."
Jada Vineyard & Winery,Grenache,90.0,75.0,1,"Lively and fresh with a floral and lemon citrus character in the nose and on the palate, this full-bodied Gewürtz offers lovely aromas and full-bodied flavors. Dry in style with a clean character. Pair with Indian or Asian cuisine or grilled chicken."
Jada Vineyard & Winery,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,48.0,1,"A blueberry-balsamic reduction sauce scent kicks off this rich and opulent wine from the legendary Hearst family. It also shows smoked beef, uncracked peppercorns, black spices, vanilla bean and black coffee on the nose. The palate is lush and layered with blueberry paste, dark-chocolate fudge and Ethiopian espresso bean."
Jada Vineyard & Winery,Mourvèdre,88.0,25.0,2,"Among an excellent trio of Chardonnays from Roco, this is the spicy one, with soft and supple tree fruits, a touch of citrus and more. The complexities pile on, suggestions of melon and cotton candy, and that lovely sweet spice."
Jada Vineyard & Winery,Red Blend,93.0,75.0,1,"Dark clay, deep layers of earth, black-cherry bread and black-slate aromas show on the nose of this finely woven wine by Matthias Pippig. The palate is distinctive, with rich yet not overripe black-plum loaf, mocha dust and black cardamom spice hiding behind the silky yet dense structure. Excellent now, it will joyously evolve. Drink 2016–2028."
Jada Vineyard & Winery,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,64.75,4,"Light in color but bursting with aromas of candied cherry, pencil lead, sauteed porcini mushrooms and rain-soaked gravel, this is a fabulous wine from an oceanview vineyard above Corralitos. Italian spices of oregano and bay leaf combine with a sesame-oil warmth and bright raspberry fruit on the zesty palate."
Jada Vineyard & Winery,Rhône-style White Blend,91.0,38.0,1,"It takes a precision winemaker to craft a Pinot Noir with such detail from a cool vintage in a cool region. Jon Meuret (founder of Maison Bleue) has the right stuff, as this new project demonstrates. Drink it now for its pure raspberry and cranberry fruit, its lightly rendered oak, its length and texture. Or wait 8–10 years and watch it develop into a complex, elegant wine with mature fruit and polished, terroir-driven flavors. Drink now through 2026."
Jada Vineyard & Winery,Syrah,94.0,55.0,1,"A rich, round and silky texture provide pure pleasure in this exotically perfumed vineyard-designate that's full bodied and exuberant in baked plum, black pepper and anise. Well integrated and complex, it traffics in deeper, darker plumes of smoke and tobacco toward the lengthy finish."
Jada Vineyard & Winery,Syrah-Cabernet,92.0,55.0,1,"A lovely bouquet of dusty rose petals marks the entry of this delightful wine. Softly textured, it's subtle in tannin and oak, with interweaving swathes of black tea and grenadine-intense cherry. Medium bodied, it remains silky and fresh through the lengthy finish."
Jaffurs,Grenache Blanc,91.0,27.0,2,"This is a gentle giant of a wine, subtle and sublime in earthy rose petals, allspice and black tea that maintain a spiky, lively acidity throughout. Blueberry and black cherry compete for attention, balancing the grapes' more savory intentions, before a smoothly intense finish rides things out."
Jaffurs,Petite Sirah,92.0,38.0,2,"Expressive and loaded with fruit, mineral and spice components, this powerful wine centers around dense flavors of black cherry and cassis. Threads of coffee, caramel, wet rock and citrus keep coming through, and the wine seems to gain strength as it goes. Just a hint of heat comes out in the tail end."
Jaffurs,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,46.0,1,"This is a beautiful wine, fully expressive of the vineyard and vintage. It's showy in juicy red and black wild berries, with just-right additions of cinnamon and black pepper. Full bodied and concentrated, it remains approachable and an ideal companion to meaty fare."
Jaffurs,Roussanne,92.0,30.0,1,"A wondrously rich and extracted nose combines layers of brown spice, dried black cherries, fragrant violets and lilacs with concentrated, almost pruney purple fruit. That ripeness expertly pairs on the palate with strong tannic structure and sparkling acidity, allowing the blackberry, blueberry, caramel and lavender notes to shine without cloying."
Jaffurs,Syrah,91.92,53.85,13,"The Roussanne really shines in the blend, offering rich, ripe, soft, seductive aromas of peaches and apricots, then folding into a broad midpalate with no rough edges. There is a definite peaches-and-cream feel to the midpalate, and that creamy flavor and texture runs right through a gentle finish."
Jaffurs,Viognier,89.67,29.0,3,"Champoux is one of Washington's most revered vineyards, known especially for the rich, black cherry fruit on display here. However, this wine seems to be aging rather quickly, the flavors turning soft and leafy in the midpalate, and the wine's rim hinting at the beginning tones of brick. It's drinking nicely, and should be consumed near term for best enjoyment."
James Mitchell,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.33,15.0,3,"This is hard to resist, a crisp, easy sipper that's gentle on the wallet and bright with sweet jasmine aromatics. On the palate expect refreshing Mandarin orange and lemon zest flavors. It's a clean, crisp wine made from organic grapes, 52% of which hail from Lake, the rest from Mendocino County."
James Wyatt,Red Blend,86.0,20.0,1,"This new vintage was barrel fermented, which fleshes out the flavors and brings some tropical notes along with the tart flavors of fresh pear. Young, sleek and showing a pleasing, wet stone minerality, this is styled for near-term enjoyment, perhaps with fresh halibut, swordfish or white salmon."
Jamie Slone Wines,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.67,48.0,3,"Ripe pear fruit introduces a full-bodied Pinot Gris, and carries it through a satisfying finish. It's fruit all the way, dusted with a little taste of cinnamon spice."
Jamie Slone Wines,Chardonnay,92.5,43.0,2,"Starting out a touch reduced, this wine shows aromas of lime leaf and peach, wanting a bit more aromatic clarity. It drinks off dry, with lean but plentiful lime and stone-fruit flavors."
Jamie Slone Wines,Red Blend,90.0,47.2,5,"In some vintages (such as 2004) the extended bottle age given to the Citation Pinot works in its favor. In this latest release, it has subtracted from, rather than added to, rather ordinary fruit flavors. Leather notes in both scent and flavor come up against raisined fruit. Tannins are tough and astringent, and there is a stemmy character to the finish. Drink up."
Jamie Slone Wines,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,39.0,1,"A late release from this cool vintage, this wine offers aromas of cocoa and berry. The flavors are light and restrained, framed by tart acidity."
Jamieson Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,53.33,3,"Aromas of herb, grass, pear and citrus lead to sleek fruit flavors. It shows a lot of elegance but lacks concentration."
Jamieson Ranch,Chardonnay,86.0,15.0,1,An earthy vein in the aromas and flavors keeps this wine from being a classic. Nonetheless it has ripe fruit flavors and a relatively smooth texture in spite of the variety's typical firm tannins.
Jamieson Ranch,Malbec,88.0,16.0,1,"The Select bottling, which appears to be TeBri's reserve, shows medium concentration, with strawberry and cherry flavors. Cola, earth, caramel and chocolate notes come together on the pretty finish."
Jamieson Ranch,Pinot Noir,88.0,15.0,1,"This estate-grown Pinot Noir artfully blends seven different clones, capturing the nuances of each, and melding them into a fascinating wine. Dig in—you'll find plenty of black cherry and cassis fruit, streaked with iron, espresso and licorice. The texture and length add more subtlety, with a delicate hint of sandalwood at the very end."
Jamieson Ranch,Red Blend,89.0,15.0,3,"Charred oak characterizes the nose of this wine from an estate just 12 miles from the Pacific Ocean, but chopped dill takes the place of overpowering butter aromas. The herbs show up on the palate, hovering on pine needles, sandalwood and oak toothpicks, with lime pith keeping it fresh."
Jamieson Ranch,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,28.0,1,"Minty, this restrained Syrah is from a sought-after vineyard, a pioneer in Sonoma County Rhône-style wines. Here, the producer keeps things interesting in swathes of white pepper, mint and cranberry, as well as a strong sense of leather throughout. High in acidity, it needs time to come together; try after 2020."
Jamieson Ranch,Zinfandel,89.5,15.0,2,"The nose is still emerging on this bottling by the historic estate, but nectarine, white and yellow flowers and a touch of cantaloupe are starting to peek out. The flavors dance between acidity and ripeness, with green apple flesh, lemon-lime peels and brisk minerality that build into a juicy finish."
Januik,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.17,65.0,6,"Pretty scents of rosewater, raspberries and cherries introduce this light and pleasing wine. It carries some of the charm of a good strawberry soda, with forward fruit and a delicate frame. That said, it is not just a simple fruity wine, and gains weight and complexity as it breathes. Give it time to show you all it has."
Januik,Cabernet Franc,90.4,35.0,5,"Such a tiny amount produced, yet the quality makes you wish for much, much more. The pale coppery rosé is wonderfully rich and toasty, with lovely raspberry and cherry fruit, a fine bead plus excellent concentration and finesse."
Januik,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.19,46.88,16,"The dark fruits of blackberry and blueberry meet up with the greener aromas of damp pine tree undergrowth and a squeeze of citrus on this blend of 52% Syrah and 48% Grenache. The light purple fruits on the palate mesh well with all sorts of herbs, including thyme, oregano and even rosemary."
Januik,Chardonnay,89.75,29.38,8,"Candied cherry, cola, wild mint and anise swirl into a layered nose on this wine by a duo of relatively new winemakers, Ian Sergy and Zach Jarosz. Light coffee, clove-spiced berry juice and cinnamon-cherry flavors are on the heavily brown-spiced palate."
Januik,Malbec,89.75,36.25,4,"Another wildly complicated Pinot Noir from Bradley Brown, this smells of crimini mushrooms, smoldering chemise and sweet cherry tomato reduction sauce, with a pinch of cinnamon. It's lush with soft red and purple fruit once sipped, with smoky spice on the edges and smashed olives throughout."
Januik,Merlot,90.0,32.0,5,"Cottonwood Canyon specializes in Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, but they also have three acres of Syrah in their Santa Maria vineyard. The result in this bottling offers aromas blending red fruit with minty herbs, like a cherry cough drop. The wine is fairly lean on the mouth, representative of a cooler-climate expression of the grape, with oregano, sour cherry, cranberry and chalky minerality. The finish is reminiscent of crème brûlée."
Januik,Petit Verdot,90.5,35.0,2,"Honey, crisp lemon and poached apple make for an excellent nose on this blend of 31% Marsanne, 26% Roussanne, 22% Grenache Blanc, 11% Viognier and 10% Picpoul. The flavors are equally impressive, with nectarine, white flowers and yellow pear making for an easy-to-quaff white wine."
Januik,Riesling,90.67,20.0,3,"This beautifully brings out and blends the crisp citrus side of the grape variety along with a touch of riper fruit flavor that's shaped by oak aging. It offers classic, grassy aromas, thirst-quenchingly tart flavors and very light touches of vanilla and nutmeg."
Januik,Sauvignon Blanc,89.33,20.67,3,"This Paulliac-style blend of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot presents bright red fruit on the nose alongside black licorice and traditional cigar box scents. The flavors are dominated by red cherries with a touch of anise, sprig of thyme and pleasingly brisk finish."
Januik,Syrah,90.83,33.33,6,"With a rich, caramel-teased nose, this is a full-bodied and voluptuous Chardonnay that evolves in the glass to display much greater sophistication and concentration. It finishes light and lemony, rounded out by juicy stone fruit."
Janzen,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.4,137.5,10,"Forward and nicely rounded off, this brings spicy cherry and cranberry fruit front and center. There are well-integrated streaks of herb, a dash of stem, and a dusting of white pepper. Give it an hour or two to breathe, or better yet, decant before drinking."
Jarvis,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,159.17,6,"A soft, moderately jammy old-vine Zinfandel—the vines at Mohr-Fry Ranch go back to 1901 and 1944—that's heady in spicy ripe blackberry with an impressive backbone of structure and mouthwatering texture."
Jarvis,Cabernet Franc,91.75,118.75,4,The Cor wines are always notable for their limited use of new French oak (this wine saw none) and a style best suited for the dinner table. This wine is no exception with distinctly fruity aromas of plum and cherry followed by notes of peat and violets. The seamless fruit flavors are accented by citrusy acidity with the tannins quite well integrated for the variety.
Jarvis,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.33,183.33,3,"A rich, thick, inky purple Petite Sirah with a small amount of Syrah blended in, offering aromas of baked plum, boysenberry and leathery spice. Elegant for the variety, the wine is concentrated and structured with a long finish of dark coffee."
Jarvis,Chardonnay,91.67,103.67,6,"Pure, sappy wine juice is the impression this wine leaves. Although it's a 2010, it is so fresh and tangy it might have come straight from the tank. Pomegranate and raspberry are the fruit highlights, with hints of pepper and herb."
Jarvis,Merlot,92.0,147.5,2,"Fruit from this 12-acre site has a well-rounded aspect, with nuanced flavors of pomegranate, marionberry, black cherry and cola. Hints of game and cured meat come through also, and the mouthfeel is sleek and wiry. It's drinking well but could certainly be cellared through 2024."
Jarvis,Petit Verdot,92.0,120.0,1,"Light aromas of the barnyard don't impede the impression of pretty strawberry-pastry fruit flavors. The aging in 20% new French oak adds streaks of vanilla, cocoa and mocha to the finish."
Jarvis,Tempranillo,94.0,85.0,1,"Opening with opulent red fruit and soft tannins, this estate-grown Tempranillo has a big presence of tobacco and pepper. With well-integrated oak it's full-bodied yet understated, opening its layers of earthy tobacco and black cherry over time. Enjoy with traditional Spanish tapas and meat-laden paella."
Jason-Stephens,Cabernet Franc,86.0,32.0,2,"Unoaked Chardonnays can be fairly neutral, but this one is anything but. Creamy and textural, it's laced with mixed flavors of grapefruit, gooseberry, lime and lemon zest. Delicious on its own, or pair it with gently seasoned seafood or poultry."
Jason-Stephens,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.17,38.33,6,"An unusual blend of 59% Sauvignon Blanc and 41% Chardonnay, this wine opens with a creamy mousse and flavors of ripe apple. Crisp, soft and medium bodied, it's textured and good at hiding the larger amount of SB, resembling more closely a traditional blanc de blancs."
Jason-Stephens,Chardonnay,85.75,25.0,4,"Light and fresh aromas of strawberry and raspberry meet with licorice and vanilla on the bright, fruit-punch-like nose of this bottling. There is snappy energy to the palate, with pomegranate and tannin-laced cranberry flavors as well as a light dusting of baking spice."
Jason-Stephens,Malbec,87.0,32.0,1,"This is a quite massive, almost overpowering take on Grenache from a biodynamic vineyard just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands, showing concentrated boysenberry and blackberry on the dark nose alongside loamy soil minerality. It's lavish and rich on the sip, with blackberry paste and tar flavors hanging from sticky tannins. This bottling still needs some time."
Jason-Stephens,Meritage,88.33,34.0,3,"This is a good, classic-style blend of Bordeaux grape varieties with just enough tannin to support the ripe blackberry and black-pepper flavors. It's dry, has medium body and a mouth-filling texture."
Jason-Stephens,Merlot,87.0,24.0,4,"A very light shade of pink, this blend of 49% Grenache, 19% Grenache Blanc, 13% Mourvèdre, 12% Carignane, 4% Cinsaut and 3% Roussanne offers wet river stones, strawberry, peach and pluot on the nose. The palate is quite subtle, with nectarine, brioche and airy watermelon flavors. Altogether it's very clean and fresh."
Jason-Stephens,Mourvèdre,87.0,28.0,1,"A rich, full-bodied wine with small amounts of Merlot and Malbec, this offers sizable tannins that wrap themselves around dark, brooding fruit and smoky oak. Blackberry and plum intertwine around luxurious chocolate and tobacco, complementing one another on the finish."
Jason-Stephens,Petite Verdot,85.0,32.0,1,"A majority varietal, a dying breed in the Napa Valley, this also has 5% Petite Sirah. The combination is dense and syrupy in strawberry and a tightness of oak. Time will soften its edges, and there's already a softness to the tannins that delights, the finish light and lean. Cellar through 2017."
Jason-Stephens,Rosé,82.0,17.0,1,"A light hay color, this wine from Andres Ibarra and Caren Rideau offers a delicate butternut squash cream-sauce element on the nose, along with white rocks and pineapple sherbet. There's lots of pep on the balanced palate, with soda, lime pith and sour orange peel, plus a touch of nuts and a vanilla on the finish."
Jason-Stephens,Syrah,89.0,31.0,2,"Since 2009, the producer has sourced from this site, a relatively warm pocket of the northern reaches of the appellation. Vibrant in red cherry fruit, it's also layered and velvety smooth, with astructure and density that makes it complex and compelling. The fruit dances in blackberry as well as strawberry, with a subtle herbal undertone."
Jason-Stephens,Zinfandel,86.0,28.0,1,"Pleasantly pungent in ripe damson plum, this Pinot has lovely acidity, giving it a spicy mouthfeel around firmly present tannins. Full-bodied midpalate, the wine mellows through to the finish, ending in juicy fruit and earth."
Jasper Sisco,Pinot Noir,88.0,34.0,1,"Bright, beautiful and balanced, this tiny production wine is aflutter in high-toned citrus notes, melon and peach. A well-crafted marriage of power and sophistication, the aromatics of wild jasmine shine, while texturally the wine is round and softly layered."
Jasper Sisco,Riesling,92.0,20.0,1,"Bryan Babcock's three decades of experience show better than ever right now. This bottling from Radian Vineyard offers aromas of charred cloves, wet slate, peppercorns and macerated raspberries. Lively and energetic on the palate, it bursts with flavors of wild berries and ripe cranberries, with a tart citrusy twist that's a wakeup call to the mouth."
Jax,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,100.0,1,"Black and white pepper splash all over the aromas of the otherwise cherry meringue-driven nose of this blend of 39% Grenache, 33% Syrah, 26% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier. It's light and airy on the palate, blending fresh strawberry fruit with a cornucopia of peppercorns. It provides a great example of how a fun, lively wine can be savorily serious as well."
Jax,Chardonnay,92.25,30.5,4,"This is one of the winery's last takes on this vineyard, as they move their focus to Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. The nose is blackberry liqueur lifted with chopped black sage, fennel stalk and tobacco leaf. Flavors run from dark red fruit to black spices to tartness on the finish, like a balsamic reduction sauce."
Jax,Pinot Noir,94.0,25.0,1,"Nicole's is a consistent stunner, upholding its reputation just fine with this vintage, a vibrant and spicy take on rich, robust cherry and black raspberry that's both juicy and smooth. The finish wraps up nicely with a take on dark chocolate and mint."
Jax,Red Blend,90.0,20.0,2,"From one block of the estate vineyard planted exclusively to Dijon clone 667, Paige's is deep and dark in color, intense in oak and earthiness, almost a quarter of it undergoing whole cluster fermentation. As intense on the palate as it is darkly hued, it offers brambly blackberry and dark cherry around a core of wild Tahitian vanilla and cinnamon-cardamom spice."
Jax,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,16.0,2,"Showing more toast than butter, this is a firm, concisely knit and dense wine. Very ripe flavors of apple and peach are wrapped in a frame of toasty oak and caramel. Decadent and delicious, it rewards some extra breathing time and can be cellared 2021–2023."
Jaxon,G-S-M,89.0,28.0,1,"Elegant and well structured, this offers vibrant strawberry fruit wrapped around inviting aromatics of violet and spice. This cool-climate Pinot boasts a silky texture on the palate and finishes with subtle suggestions of wood smoke and cinnamon."
Jaxon,Red Blend,87.33,29.33,3,"A powerful, brooding nose of black cardamom and crushed clove melds with pomegranate and cherry, resulting in an incredibly aromatic wine that hails from a popular vineyard on the eastern edge of the appellation. The flavors are also quite deep—sour cherry, mocha, more clove—atop layers of bitter plum peels and refreshing acid."
Jaxon,Syrah-Grenache,91.0,26.0,2,"Coming from Monterey and Santa Cruz vineyards, this blend of 34% Grenache, 23% Syrah, 18% Mourvèdre, 21% Carignane and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon features notes of plum jam, sagebrush and root beer. It jumps off the palate with bright acidity and grippy tannins, delivering ripe berry fruit and chili pepper spices, enlivening more senses than just tastebuds."
Jaxon,Tempranillo-Garnacha,87.0,27.0,2,"On display are the requisite Cayuse flavors of funk, savory herb and composted earth, with moderately ripe black fruits in the background. A whiff of pine needles and plenty of forest floor accents complete the picture."
Jayson,Chardonnay,91.0,50.0,1,"This is a unique and exciting take on California's historic grape from one of the region's pioneering wineries. Aromas recall sour cranberry, orange peel, strawberry and sagebrush. It's savory and herbal on the palate, with baking and Indian spices of cardamom and chai as well as mocha."
Jean Edwards,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.5,65.0,2,"The aromatics jump out, an intriguing mix of cherry fruit, leather, coffee and mocha. This is a block selection, and as such it is both precise and also a bit wanting in the midpalate. With ample aeration it fills in, finishing with dark fruit, roasted tannins and a little heat."
Jeff Gordon,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,65.0,1,"Half of the grapes in this wine were fermented on the skins for almost a month and aged in old barrels, offering something completely different from the producer's standard wine from this varietal. Indeed orange in color, it veers metallic on the palate, before relaxing into a mix of honey and preserved lemon—the texture somewhat unctuous despite a restrained level of alcohol."
Jeff Gordon,Chardonnay,89.0,42.0,2,"This is a generously concentrated and yet balanced wine, big in oak presence and structure that mellows in the glass. Lemon verbena and ginger appoint themselves in charge, their minions a mix of salted seaweed and Asian pear."
Jeff Gordon,Pinot Noir,84.0,50.0,1,"Named for the 50 tons of rock removed from this section of an estate vineyard, this Cab also contains 8% Malbec, 5% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot. It's likable in its juicy black cherry, cedar and pencil lead. Full bodied and robust on the palate, it teases in blueberry, chocolate and raspberry, with a grippy presence of tannin."
Jeff Gordon,Red Blend,90.0,65.0,1,"This is a tight, extracted and focused wine generous in dark red fruit and forested earth. A thickness and density make it mouthfilling, juicy and most definitely full bodied. The finish is a mix of tobacco and black tea."
Jekel,Chardonnay,89.0,17.0,1,"Named for a great David Bowie song, this wine would appeal to Ziggy Stardust himself with its chameleon-like ability to swing between steely and sultry, almost sweet, diving into decadence with ease. Lemon peel and grilled pineapple marry well with generous yet managed oak, finishing creamy and quick."
Jericho Canyon Vineyard,Rosé,89.0,40.0,1,"Concentrated in cherry, spiced plum, cola, milk chocolate and beef jerky notes, this wine is a blend of 61% Tempranillo, 23% Malbec, 14% Mourvèdre and 2% Alicante Bouschet. Soy, blueberry, black plum and black raspberry entertain the palate, where smoke and pepper round out the nuances."
Jessie's Grove,Red Blend,89.5,45.0,2,"Smoky, fruity and spicy in equal measure, this wine is 57% Cabernet Sauvignon-based, with 15% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Franc and 14% Malbec. With balanced acidity and an integrated use of oak, it offers structure and length beyond its crisp cassis, raspberry and blackberry notes."
Jessie's Grove,Zinfandel,91.0,32.0,1,"Light orange-pink in color, this wine is boosted by 2% Syrah, 1% Mourvèdre and 1% Grenache Blanc. It shows squeezed lime and pressed watermelon on the nose, proving quite Provencal in style. The cotton-candy palate is lifted by citrus pith, proving tightly wound while quite mouthwatering."
Jodar,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,29.0,1,"Barrel fermented and aged in 100% new French oak, this wine brings aromas of toasty barrel spices, peach and lemon curd. It's full bodied and creamy in feel, with the alcohol poking through and providing some distraction."
Jodar,Petite Sirah,88.0,32.0,2,"Coming from a big, popular vineyard now owned by the Chumash tribe, this exciting wine shows very salty apples, dried yellow rose and green grapefruit rind on the nose. The flavors warm up toward cooked apples, seared pears and nectarine flesh, rounded out by a touch of buttercream."
Jodar,Red Blend,82.0,34.0,1,"This well-regarded vineyard shines here, ripening the grapes fully in a challenging vintage. Raspberry and cherry flavors are joined with a streak of red licorice. Among the 2013s from Purple Hands, this is likely to be the longest lived."
Joel Gott,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,18.0,1,"Blended with 13% Petite Sirah, this wine offers smoky leather and brambly black and red berry around soft, dusty tannins and plenty of structure. Rich and concentrated, it finishes in a blaze of dark chocolate and black pepper."
Joel Gott,Zinfandel,90.0,28.0,1,"Red plum and cherry surround soft, firm tannins, medium acidity and plenty of well-constructed structure, unimpeded by oak. A hint of leather, dried herb and bay leaf accent it well. Although the wine is powerful, it's not overdone, instead offering balance."
Joey Tensley,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,18.0,1,"This wine is co-fermented with 12% Petite Sirah, both varieties from one estate block planted to a century-old clone of Teldeschi, a nearby vineyard still in existence. Tart in cherry, red plum and cassis, it's refreshingly unusual and deliciously vibrant. Anise, cinnamon and black pepper round out the finish. The tannins and oak are well-managed and integrated."
Johan,Grüner Veltliner,86.0,24.0,1,"Spicy, punchy and pungent, this bright and crisply defined effort displays a riot of orange and apricot fruit flavors, morphing into a Grand Marnier finish. It's deep and persistent, fully ripe but neither hot nor bitter."
Johan,Pinot Noir,86.5,38.5,2,"This grape, seldom planted on the Central Coast, produces a wine that boasts intense aromas of passion fruit juice and candied grapefruit. It's lively and ripe on the palate, with white rose and apple blossom flavors, yet balanced, with lime peel, cut grass and steel accents."
Johan Vineyards,Pinot Noir,83.0,35.0,1,"Produced at White Rose winery, this estate bottling is compact and spicy, framing its raspberry and red plum fruit with aromatic herbs. Tannins are stiff and granular, stretching out in a finish streaked with cacao, espresso and mineral."
Joleté,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.33,27.67,3,"Don't be misled by the low alcohol; there's more than a smidgen of residual sugar in this wine. It works to good effect, adding richness to the fruit and roundness to the mouthfeel. Pear, peach and apricot flavors fill the palate, with generous streaks of honey and tea adding further complexity."
Joleté,Pinot Noir,86.5,25.0,2,"This is a barrel selection, with the majority of the barrels from Shea, Zenith and Illahe vineyard fruit. Toasty, smooth, supple and pleasing, it begins with tart red fruits framed by citrusy acidity. It breathes open and stays fresh for more than a day, with light red fruits, milk chocolate, and firm, balanced tannins."
Joliesse,Shiraz,85.0,9.0,1,"This shows petrol, honey and brie cheese rind notes on the nose, and is quite creamy once sipped, yet the edges are punctuated with orange peel bitterness. The tartness ensures cellaring potential, so drink 2018–2025."
Jon Nathaniel,Red Blend,83.0,50.0,1,"Dense aromas consume the nose of this bottling, showing orange liqueur, apple juice and concentrated lemon syrup. The palate is nicely sharp in mouthwatering acidity, offering juicy stone-fruit flavors."
Jones of Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.67,25.0,3,"From an estate-farmed vineyard, this medium-bodied wine is earthy and aromatic in baked bread, with soft, moderate acidity. With length and breadth, it shows a tartness of black tea and stems, finishing in oak."
Jones of Washington,Chardonnay,88.0,14.5,2,"Eroica has a proven ability to age; in fact it needs at least a half decade in the cellar to show its real strengths. Tight and packed with primary fruit flavors of lime and peach, this beautifully proportioned wine has perceptible sweetness but plenty of natural acidity. Lively and fresh today, but best given a few more years in the cellar."
Jones of Washington,Pinot Gris,91.0,12.0,1,"A gorgeous wine, dense with flavor. Smooth and plummy, it's loaded with thick streaks of licorice, chocolate, baking spices and coffee liqueur. Long and flowing, it just seduces from the first sip to the last swallow."
Jones of Washington,Riesling,88.0,12.0,1,"This Chiles Valley producer, on the eastern edge of the Napa Valley, has made a big Chardonnay that doesn't exude much aromatically at first and veers sweet, but is otherwise balanced and could develop some interesting minerality over time."
Jones of Washington,Viognier,90.0,15.0,1,"This is a big Merlot, earthy but a tad flat, with a tobacco-like bitterness on the tail end."
Joseph Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,65.0,1,"The delicate nose on this reserve Chard offers citrus and flowers with a touch of nutty spice. On the palate, it's a straightforward white with elements of lemon citrus, grapefruit and hazelnut. An easy-drinking Chardonnay with class."
Joseph Cellars,Merlot,88.0,55.0,1,"Since last reviewed in 2008, the Alloro Vineyard's grapes seem to have gained in complexity and sophistication. Elegant and fine tuned, this new release combines scents and accents of rose petals, wet rock and raspberries with generous, supporting acidity. The finish extends gracefully with the finesse of Premier Cru Burgundy."
Joseph Cellars,Pinot Noir,88.0,55.0,1,"A limited-production wine made to commemorate the Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality, this full-bodied vineyard-designated wine is softly layered in bold, rich huckleberry pie and strawberry flavors. Juicy on the palate, the fruit is seasoned with clove, cola and a hint of earth."
Joseph Filippi,Chenin Blanc,88.0,20.0,1,"A fairly priced varietal wine, this shows currant, cranberry, raisin and a flurry of allspice on the nose. It takes on rose petal and lavender aromas as it opens, making it all the more pleasant and memorable."
Joseph Filippi,Red Blend,91.0,29.0,1,"This cuvée gets some extra time in 40% new wood, and is bottled unfiltered. Plush blackberry and black cherry fruit flavors, accented with streaks of cola and chocolate, capture your attention. It's a rich tasty forward immediately enjoyable bottle, so go for it now through 2020."
Joseph Filippi,Sherry,90.0,25.0,1,"Golden Delicious apple meets tart Meyer lemon in this medium-bodied, expressive vineyard designate bolstered by 25% new French oak. A velvety texture enwraps its savory fruitiness and stony acidity."
Joseph Filippi,Zinfandel,86.0,29.0,1,"Spicy earth meets baked plum and cherry in this medium-bodied wine sourced from multiple sites, including Sangiacomo Vineyards. Mint and lavender scents emerge on the nose before stronger elements of tobacco take over on the finish."
Joseph Jewell,Pinot Noir,91.21,43.0,14,"Baked cherry and cranberry fruit kick off the nose of this bottling, followed by then wild thyme and touches of dust and smoke. The palate is light and zesty, with hibiscus and tea flavors along with cranberry fruit and more fresh herbs on the finish."
Joseph Jewell,Zinfandel,91.0,39.0,1,"From a cool site high above the coastal town of Jenner, this 100% varietal wine is made in small amounts and given almost two years in French oak, only a quarter of it new. Intense, it exudes baked and dried fruit flavors, along with chewy, meaty layers of texture and concentration."
Joseph Phelps,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,96.33,246.67,3,"This is a touch overripe and plummy, akin to a puree on the nose. Smoky oak lurks behind the fruit, along with a taste of almond and tea. In the end, the wine ends robustly and full-figured, with plenty of power and concentration to the finish."
Joseph Phelps,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,72.5,2,"Dark mauve in color, nearly approaching a red-wine tone, this shows a fruit-forward nose of red cherries and strawberry jam. The palate is a mix of tart, sour and grippy texture, with cherry fruit and plum-skin flavors."
Joseph Phelps,Chardonnay,93.43,63.57,7,"Crushed oregano, red currant and a little bit of asphalt show on the shy nose of this wine that is sourced mainly from southern Monterey County. There is lots of brick, thyme and rosemary on the palate, with a bit of dried berry fruit."
Joseph Phelps,Pinot Noir,92.67,66.11,9,"Coming from a cool vintage, this wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with aromas of green herbs, dill and baking spices. It's quite light in style, not entirely holding together."
Joseph Phelps,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,36.25,4,"Candied apricot dominates on the nose and palate of this vineyard-designated wine that is fleshy and reflective of its five months in new French oak. Creamy and round, it finishes ripe and rich."
Joseph Phelps,Scheurebe,91.0,50.0,1,"This elegant and flavorful wine has a vivid salmon color. Aromas combine cherries and a slight earthiness, paired with a luxurious texture from the tiny bubbles and slight sweetness. Attractive layers of flavor and the rich texture keep it lingering on the finish."
Joseph Phelps,White Blend,94.0,50.0,1,"Aged 14 months in Russian Oak, this is a different kind of Chard with notes of chamomile, fresh mint sprigs, vanilla and cigar tobacco among the more typical melon fruits and lime citrus. Medium-full but a bit flat in the mouth with a solid but quite smoky finish."
Joseph Soggé,Pinot Noir,89.0,38.0,1,"Named for a favored surf spot in Mexico, Sayulita is a new project from Balboa. This first release, from the Lefore vineyard, is 58% Cabernet Sauvignon and 42% Syrah, a perfect mix and showcase for the strengths of both. Soft and smooth, it's tightly woven with veins of earth, pepper, black olive, coffee, black fruits and licorice."
Joseph Swan Vineyards,Chardonnay,93.17,42.67,6,"The second edition of Chateau Rollat's Ardenvoir Sémillon includes eight percent Sauvignon Blanc in the blend, a nice addition that tightens up the mouthfeel. Barrel fermented, it's bursting with rich tropical fruit flavors, Meyer lemon, sweet toasted cracker and caramel, an exceptionally concentrated and full-bodied wine."
Joseph Swan Vineyards,Gewürztraminer,92.0,22.0,1,"This wine opens in candied ginger and orange peel, invitingly light in color and weight, with elegance at its core. Silky texture wraps around plum, sage and that classic notion of forest floor."
Joseph Swan Vineyards,Grenache Blanc,90.5,26.0,2,"This rich, mouth-coating effort marries Meyer lemon, pink grapefruit and white peach to sappy acidity. It persistently pushes through the palate into a lingering finish, with a lip-licking snap that invites the next sip."
Joseph Swan Vineyards,Petite Sirah,88.0,32.0,2,"This is a keeper. Smoky, charred aromas, rich dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and boysenberry and meaty, peppery accents fill up this full-bodied and very firmly textured wine. It will get even more interesting with age; try it after 2020."
Joseph Swan Vineyards,Pinot Noir,92.25,48.5,8,"An amazingly sweet and rich wine, this has a floral aroma and great concentration. It offers layers of flavor like dried fruit, honey and boysenberry syrup, with good acidity for balance. This makes a fabulous dessert by itself and is sweet enough to conquer almost any other confection."
Joseph Swan Vineyards,Syrah,92.5,34.0,2,"Classy in style and classic in flavors, this single vineyard selection offers strawberry fruit with highlights of melon and orange peel. It's dappled with notes of coffee and cola, smoothed out from 16 months in French oak, one-fifth of it new."
Joseph Swan Vineyards,Tannat,90.0,30.0,2,"A sensational value, this blends fruit from a half-dozen vineyards that carry the winery's vineyard designates. Soft and appealing flavors mix citrus, plum and berry in a juicy, wide open, flat out delicious bottle. The fruit is the star, although a year in 9% new French oak adds a nice touch of toast."
Joseph Swan Vineyards,Viognier,92.5,26.0,2,"This winery not only makes a bunch of single vineyard bottlings, but also tries to show off different styles. This one shows sweeter white peach, ripe cantaloupe, lush mango and a touch of vanilla on the nose. The palate is ripe and round with more mango, melon, papaya and banana flavors, yet that opulence is bound by chalky structure and lots of back-end acid."
Joseph Swan Vineyards,Zinfandel,91.0,32.4,5,"The first Merlot offering from this producer, this is 100% varietal and totally full-throttle in its fleshy components of vanilla and chocolate, seasoned in cinnamon. Fresh and somewhat floral, it's bright despite its size and lively on the palate. The wine is made in tiny amounts."
Josh Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,20.0,1,"This wine certainly packs in the flavor. It has lots of jammy, grapy aromas, and flavors that drip boysenberry and blackberry, followed by baking-spice accents. It has a full body, an almost thick texture and mild acidity and tannins."
Josh Cellars,Red Blend,87.5,14.0,2,"Assorted blue fruit, coffee, green tea and barrel-spice aromas lead to full-bodied fruit flavors that carry a touch of warmth."
Joullian,Cabernet Franc,85.0,35.0,1,"The oak (two-thirds new French and American) leads, with aromas of cocoa, cinnamon and spice followed by plum. The palate shows an elegant styling but with good intensity to the flavors."
Joullian,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,34.0,1,"This wine is five years old and is starting to show its age. Aromas of dried tobacco, tomato leaf, mesquite and vanilla are followed by velvety-feeling fruit flavors that show a pleasing persistence. Drink now."
Joullian,Chardonnay,89.12,32.5,8,"This pale-colored wine is light, fresh and crisp, with very subtle fruit and nut flavors, lively acidity and a tangy, lingering finish. It's offers a great change of pace."
Joullian,Muscat Hamburg,88.0,32.0,1,"Dried lemon peels and a hint of butter-fried apples show on the nose. Strong lemon acidity drives the palate, with a touch of sea salt and stone fruit proving very familiar."
Joullian,Red Blend,89.5,20.5,2,"This wine is a blend 44% Merlot, 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Malbec and 8% Cabernet Franc. Aromas of cocoa, coconut, herb and cherry are followed by an elegantly styled palate, full of coconut flavors. There's enjoyment to be had but the oak plays too primary of a role."
Joullian,Sauvignon Blanc,88.33,26.0,3,"Smoky like a barbecue, this wine offers a soft simple thread of cured meat and sweet berry pie, while the oak is supportive and evocative of vanilla. Full bodied, this is a bold, ripe wine."
Joullian,Syrah,85.0,35.0,1,"Age has mellowed this potent Port-style wine a bit but hardly tamed it. The dark auburn edge to the otherwise black color hints at its maturity as do the pruny nutty roasted-cherry flavors. It's very full bodied and definitely sweet, but not cloying."
Joullian,Sémillon,89.0,25.0,1,"Bright aromas of freshly sliced pear, apple and spice are followed by lightly creamy fruit flavors that paint around the edges. It's a well-made wine but the middle seems missing."
Joullian,Zinfandel,85.75,23.75,4,"Aged in 45% new French oak, aromas of cocoa, vanilla and barrel spice are at the fore followed by full-bodied but still tart raspberry and cranberry flavors. It brings a bit of heat along with it."
Joyce,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,70.0,1,"Dark berry aromas and fruity but somewhat subdued flavors are supported by firm tannins and good, mild acidity in this full-bodied wine. It is tasty and rather big in mouthfeel."
Joyce,Chardonnay,92.0,25.0,1,"Fruity and slightly candied flavors make this wine taste fresh and soft. One of very few vineyard-designated white Zins, it has strawberry and raspberry jam flavors, relatively full body and a rich texture."
Joyce,Grenache,92.0,35.0,1,"This is half Cab Franc, the rest an equal mix of Malbec, Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon. Blackberry and black cherry fruits fill the mouth, with just a hint of barrel toast and coffee grounds. Citrusy acidity buoys up the fruit and keeps the overall balance on point."
Joyce,Pinot Noir,90.5,37.5,2,"This tasty bottle does not push for maximum ripeness, settling comfortably into a ripe-enough mix of apples, pears and nectarines. There's a dusting of cinnamon and even a little hint of brown sugar, though the wine is definitely finished dry. The balance holds true through a medium-long finish."
Joyce,Riesling,89.0,23.5,2,"This is a single vineyard Semillon from Canyon Vineyard Ranch in the Yakima Valley. It's über aromatic and flavorful with notes of orange peel, honey and citrus. The 170 g/L residual sugar provides richness and the neutral French oak aging only adds to the wine's viscous feel."
Joyce,Rosé,92.0,25.0,1,"This vineyard-designated Mourvèdre is nearly 100% varietal with just a small splash of Syrah added. The grape's white pepper, pomegranate and gamy character is on full display here, framed by the refreshing acidity of the vintage."
Joyce,Syrah,92.0,32.0,1,"This dessert blend of 56% Sémillon and 44% Sauvignon Blanc smells like liquid honey, with beeswax and concentrated apple syrup as supporting aromas. It's viscous with decent grip on the palate, offering flavors of crushed apples, lemon syrup and a lime freshness, with lots of length."
Judd's Hill,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.5,67.5,2,"Named after the owner's daughter, this fairly priced wine offers steely aromas that are rounded by lime, honeysuckle, kiwi and apple flesh. It's sleek and minerally on the palate, with baking soda and lime flavors, as well as a bit of struck match smokiness."
Judd's Hill,Merlot,88.0,45.0,1,"Done in a medium-dry style, this shows petrol, lime pith, lime blossoms and wet cement on the nose. The palate is rich with squeezed lemon juice, shaved citrus ice, ripe pears and a stony grip that holds it all together."
Judd's Hill,Roussanne,91.0,38.0,1,"Juicy, nearly sweet-smelling aromas of blackberry pie introduce this wine by master sommelier Paolo Barbieri, who moved from Las Vegas to become a winemaker in the Santa Ynez Valley a few years ago. The flavors are streamlined and fruit-forward with dark purple and red berries, as well as root beer and cola notes."
Judge Palmer,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.2,87.8,5,"The odd name (misspelled on the front label, correct on the back) means beyond the beyond. It's a lightly buttery, nutty take on a relatively simple, yet tasty Chardonnay, with mixed apple, tangerine and honeydew fruits."
Judge Palmer,Malbec,92.0,55.0,1,"Fully ripe, this opens with scents of hibiscus tea, mixed berry, plum and black cherry. The fruit flavors are bold and intense, right on the border of showing some prune character. Streaks of balsamic, tobacco and black olive make it a real potpourri. Drink up now through 2018."
Judge Palmer,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,33.5,2,"A spicy oak aroma, fresh red cherry and cranberry flavors and a brisk, slightly tannic texture make this wine quite appetizing. While medium bodied, it has plenty of flavor impact as well as an enticing mouthfeel."
Judson Hale Winery,Pinot Noir,86.0,35.0,1,"Smooth and supple, this mix of Syrah, Cab Franc, Merlot and Malbec offers generous mixed berry fruit in a fresh, enjoyable style. What's missing is a sense of focus, rather than just blending of four disparate grapes."
Julia's Dazzle,Pinot Grigio,90.0,15.0,1,"This playful, drink-now blend of 64% Counoise and 36% Cinsault is great for those seeking to try lesser known Rhône varieties. Rose petals, plum blossoms, hibiscus and gamy notes entertain the nose. Anise seeds power the tip of the palate before red fruits and purple flowers play into a quick, easy finish."
Julia's Dazzle,Pinot Gris,88.0,16.0,1,"Asian spices, plum jelly and milk chocolate flavors combine in this solid effort, which lacks only a bit more midpalate weight to really excel. As it stands, it is a tasty wine with a slight dip between start and finish."
Julia's Dazzle,Rosé,88.0,20.0,1,"This bottling is dark and dense on the nose with black cherry, dried blueberry and espresso notes that balance the strong minerality of iron and volcanic rocks. It's quite lively on the sip, with tart blackberry juice and touches of tar."
Julietta,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,70.0,2,"This is a whopper of a wine, thanks to the high alcohol and long aging, with aromas of caramelized blueberries, black-cherry syrup and concentrated lilacs. The palate is thick with fudge and blackberry-jam flavors, with a decent energy cutting through the brooding tar and pipesmoke character."
Julietta,Rosé,87.0,24.0,1,"This blend of 50% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Malbec, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc shows cocoa dust, leather, beef jerky, dried blueberries and boysenberries on the nose. The palate is dense with tarry fruit notes, offering dark elderberries and smoked beef flavors."
Justin,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.2,63.8,5,"An excellent wine for those seeking a snappy, tart take on Rhône grapes, this blend of 90% Syrah, 9% Grenache and 1% Riesling shows dried strawberries, plum and pencil shavings on the nose. The palate is tart with plum skin, asphalt and black rocks, a very intriguing style though not for those seeking a hearty Syrah."
Justin,Cabernet Franc-Merlot,89.0,49.0,1,"Pressed blueberry, black pepper and pencil lead show on this nose of this 50% Grenache and 50% Syrah blend by former football pro Terry Hoage, who recently renamed his brand. The palate on this juicy yet spicy bottling offers smoked meats and beef-jerky flavors with tar, black pepper and tangy boysenberry."
Justin,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.75,78.75,4,"Big, bold and unreservedly stemmy, this Carmenère pulls in enough black-cherry fruit to balance out the herbs. The assertive tannins carry notes of earth, dried leaf and dark chocolate."
Justin,Red Blend,94.0,50.0,2,"A standout in the portfolio, this is a sleek, strong effort with tart purple fruits and mineral underpinnings. There's an ample whiff of smoke and a general earthiness around the tannins, with a hint of iron ore. The chalky finish is the only distraction."
Justin,Syrah,93.0,100.0,1,"This small-production, nouveau-style wine was made without oak or filtering. Simple and juicy, it's festive, with effusive dried cranberry and cola spice notes that are soft and easygoing."
Justin,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,50.0,1,"A light earthy aroma and enjoyable savory flavors suggesting dried herbs, bouillon and canteloupe characterize this deceptively full-bodied, dry wine. It has a nervy, crisp texture, great acidity and intriguing complexity."
K Squared Cellars,Pinot Noir,91.0,42.0,1,"This is still pretty stiff and tight through the midpalate, with fruit ranging from cranberry to raspberry and sour cherry. Tannins leave a slightly green impression; the wine doesn't seem ripe and full flavored. Some extra bottle age might improve it. Drink 2020 to 2024."
K Vintners,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,75.0,1,"A rather hefty version of a German-style dry wine, this has a rich texture and white peach and apricot flavors, all supported by tangy acidity. Kerner is the main grape variety in the blend, which is quite unusual in the U.S."
K Vintners,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.5,45.0,2,"Bold and very ripe in flavor, but also soft in texture, this wine is packed with blackberry, boysenberry and fig notes. It seems slightly sweet on the palate and finishes with a jammy touch. While full-bodied, it's smooth and easy to sip."
K Vintners,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,94.75,60.0,4,"Complex blackberry, black plum, white pepper, wet slate and sagebrush aromas lead into a palate of dried berry, gravel and tar flavors. Its bountiful fruit character is offset by a background of dried oregano and thyme notes."
K Vintners,Grenache,92.67,50.0,3,"A full, fleshy, lushly fruited Pinot Noir, streaked with espresso and caramel from barrel aging. The fruit and overall structure are up to the challenge of the wood; lots of black cherry and even hints of cassis running through the core. A finish with some noticeable heat supports the 15.4% alcohol reading, but it's a tasty bottle of wine."
K Vintners,Malbec,92.0,70.0,1,"Thea's Selection is Lemelson's “measuring stick” Pinot Noir, as it is a blend of blocks from the different estate vineyards. This elegant release emphasizes aromas of pungent herbs, lifted with hints of rose petal and briary berry. In the mouth there is a lively, sappy, fruit-centric focus, showing concentrated raspberry (framboise) flavors. In short, a thoroughly delicious bottle that makes the case for blends over most single-vineyard offerings in Oregon."
K Vintners,Merlot,89.5,45.0,2,"Leathery aromas of dried, sour blueberries show on the nose of this bottling. That sour-berry component extends to the palate, where tar, dried tobacco and more leather make for a somewhat tired sip."
K Vintners,Red Blend,94.25,66.25,4,"An astonishing Pinot Gris, certainly among the best ever made in Oregon, this rich, luscious, mouthcoating wine is totally irresistible. Chardonnay-like unctuousness, ripe pear and apple fruit, plus hints of honey, butter and spice make it practically a meal in itself."
K Vintners,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.5,60.0,2,"Restrained and elegant, this deeply flavored Pinot Noir takes a masculine turn with threads of iron filings, earth and herb. The blueberry and plum fruit flavors are set against drying tannins. As with all Archery Summit Pinots, the length and balance are outstanding."
K Vintners,Sangiovese,91.67,45.0,3,"High toned and grapy when first opened, this opens up nicely with decanting. Pretty raspberry and light cherry fruit are enhanced with aromas of fresh-cut tobacco and just-picked herbs. The length and detail are impressive."
K Vintners,Syrah,93.0,55.81,37,"This shows a darker shade than most young whites, almost a burnished gold. Soft and complex, with ripe, slightly confected fruit flavors, it's super smooth, with honeysuckle highlights around waxy stone fruits. Excellent length."
K Vintners,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,65.0,1,"Irresistible from the get-go, this fragrant wine offers up inviting aromas of citrus, stone and exotic tropical fruits. Flavors of ripe peaches, brightened with vivid acidity, keep it in perfect balance. The 1.4% residual sugar is barely noticeable; the finish lingers gracefully and refreshes the palate, inviting the next sip."
K Vintners,Viognier,88.0,45.0,1,"This wine is gorgeous, with flavors of hazelnut, pear and ripe green apple. It's crisp, balanced and perfectly sweetened. Mixed with vodka and fresh fruit juices, it also makes a fine cocktail."
K&M;,Chardonnay,90.0,30.0,1,"Toast, spice, lees and baked-apple aromas are followed by medium-bodied flavors that show restraint."
K&M;,Pinot Noir,90.0,40.0,1,"Made from 70% Zinfandel, 17% Petite Sirah and 3% Alicante Bouschet, this is bocce-court wine, a nod to Sonoma County's vinous heritage that opens in forested notes and dried plum, blueberry and a hint of pine. Plush and full bodied, it holds on to its tannins without completely giving in to them."
Kaella,Sangiovese,89.0,25.0,1,"Generous barrel aromas of vanilla and wood spice are followed full-bodied, no-holds-barred fruit and vanilla flavors. There are good things going on but the wood steals the show."
Kaella,Syrah,90.0,35.0,1,"This aromatic wine has floral, grapefruity aromas, generous citrus flavors, light body, a dry profile and a slightly soft, smooth texture."
Kaena,Grenache,91.67,50.0,3,"Lightly volatile aromas are followed by cranberry, cherry and herb flavors that show intensity and freshness."
Kaena,Grenache Blanc,85.0,28.0,1,"This wine is equal parts Walla Walla Valley Viognier and Yakima Valley Roussanne. Aromas of lees, almond and apricot are followed by elegantly styled flavors that linger."
Kaena,Riesling,89.0,25.0,1,"Subdued stone-fruit, jasmine and white-flower aromas lead to off-dry fruit flavors. It goes down easy."
Kaena,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,25.0,1,"The blend includes 18% Syrah, which helps to emphasize the spice and sweet fruit flavors. But in the back, this is a stiff and fairly tannic wine, with a disconnect between the strawberry fruit and the slightly stemmy, herbal finish."
Kagan,Chardonnay,88.0,45.0,1,"Crisp and stony, this lovely wine is medium-bodied and balanced, with green apple fruit, Asian spice and a voluptuous texture and finish."
Kagan,Syrah,91.0,54.0,1,"Plump and inviting black cherry fruit melds with char, soy and purple flower aromas on the nose of this atypical blend of 38% Syrah, 31% Cabernet Franc and 31% Merlot. The wine is cohesive on the palate, with persistent tannins and smoke, coffee, red fruit and dried herb flavors."
Kalaris,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,26.0,1,"Brick red in color, this wine also smells of brick and smoke. On the palate, it's moderately structured and robustly ripe, showing burly blueberry and mocha chocolate flavors with unfettered fervor."
Kale,Grenache Blanc,92.0,40.0,1,"Juicy and high in acidity, this is an easy quaffer, begging to be paired with fresh sea fare, be it oysters or cracked crab. Rare in California and usually considered a blending agent for Rhône whites, the grape shows potential from this estate."
Kale,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,60.0,2,"With 3% Syrah, this wine has a leathery, gamy character to it, the grapes grown at high elevation. Blueberry and blackberry notes provide a robust backdrop of fruitiness, as chewy, smoky tannins support concentrated black cherry flavor on the finish."
Kale,Rosé,92.0,35.0,2,"Three quarters Merlot, with 17% Cabernet Franc and 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a bit lighter than the 2007 Merlot, but just as good, if not better. Lush and loaded with black cherry, blackberry, cocoa and baking spices, it extends deliciously and seamlessly into a long, ripe, smooth finish."
Kale,Syrah-Grenache,91.0,57.5,2,"From old vines dating to 1865, this is a hugely fragrant mountainous Zinfandel, with an abundance of raspberry and blackberry flavors. A wine with a huge presence and soft, rounded tannins, it's extremely yummy with a ton of peppery spice on the long finish."
Kale,Syrah-Grenache-Viognier,90.0,45.0,1,"A vibrant, flashy, fruit-laden nose introduces this lively G-S-M blend. The three component grapes all contribute different red, blue and purple berry flavors, nicely wound together with supporting acidity. Sappy, fresh and seductive, with the potential for a few years of aging."
Kaleidos,Grenache,90.0,38.0,1,"This dessert wine is a blend of 80% Semillon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc. Dark-golden in hue, it tastes like a fresh apricot tart glazed ever so slightly with sugar. Light drinking and very beautifully made, try enjoying this poured over vanilla ice cream."
Kaleidos,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.78,42.11,9,"A rustic nose gives way to a touch of clove and Asian spice, as full-bodied, robustly ripe baked plum and cherry generously provide flavor and power on the palate. The spiciness lingers on the finish."
Kaleidos,Syrah,92.0,58.25,4,"Aromas of toast, char and black fruit are followed by lightly sweet blue and black fruit flavors. It goes down easy."
Kamiak,Chardonnay,85.0,15.0,1,"Lemon peel, brioche and raspberry aromas take the lead on this pale pink wine. It drinks quite sweet for a brut but still delivers enjoyment with its raspberry flavors."
Kamiak,Red Blend,86.75,15.25,4,"This wine is a blend of Primitivo (46%), Petite Sirah (29%) and Zinfandel. Aromas of huckleberry, raspberry, herb and spice lead to sweet blue-fruit flavors that provide enjoyment."
Kamiak,White Blend,86.0,12.5,2,"A blend of fruit from up-and-coming Red Heaven and Scooteney Flats vineyards, this wine brings aromas of game, medicine cabinet and cherry. The fruit flavors are soft in feel, seeming somewhat dried out."
Kana,Red Blend,86.17,19.0,6,"This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec from both the Sonoma Valley and Alexander Valley appellations, that works in its big, broad and tannic approach to ripeness and bold flavor. Plum, cranberry and currant provide fruit as black olive plays on the back of the palate."
Kana,Rhône-style Red Blend,85.4,19.0,5,"Reserved aromas of cherry, cranberry, pencil lead and barrel spice lead to sweet fruit flavors back by lightly grainy tannins."
Kana,Riesling,85.0,14.0,1,This is a high-strung sparkler made from equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. It has a stony texture that leans into rich flavors of brioche and honey.
Kana,White Blend,83.0,14.0,1,"Ripe and plummy in explosive fruit and heat, this wine shows cherry-berry jamminess wrapped in a leathery, meaty package dusted in cinnamon and brown sugar."
Kandarian,Sauvignon Blanc,87.67,23.33,3,"Reduced, and cradled in big oak, this wine is spiky and savory, intense and tart, with a densely overripe notion of syrupy cherry and berry."
Kanzler,Pinot Noir,91.0,72.0,1,"This is a solid effort, with good varietal character and definition. Half was fermented in stainless, half in neutral barrel, and the wine was given extended (130 days) lees contact. The herbal, peppery tang of the grape is clearly there, with intriguing hints of slate laced through the finish. This would be dynamite with sushi."
Karah Estate,Pinot Noir,86.67,35.0,3,"A barrel selection, the Suzanne's Reserve is more concentrated than its less expensive sibling (the Cali's Cuvée) but does not have as interesting a flavor set. Here you'll find the tangy cherry fruit is accompanied by sharp acids and chewy tannins. Although it is a 2004 the wine still seems wrapped up and refuses to let go. Give it plenty of air before drinking."
Karma,Chardonnay,87.0,15.0,1,"Venturing into the orange side of the rosé color rainbow, this Mourvèdre-based wine—with 13% Grenache—brings melon, guava, pomelo and ripening banana to the nose, followed by papaya and watermelon once sipped. It's a revealing look at the potential of the overlooked Central Coast vineyards that winemaker Ian Brand diligently seeks out, both for his personal labels and the many for which he consults."
Karma Vineyards,Sparkling Blend,87.25,55.0,4,"Made from 88% Grenache and 12% Viognier, this lilting wine abounds with dry, fruity and floral characteristics. Salmon-peach in color, it has texture and the requisite refreshment offered by its barely ripe strawberry and peach swathes. Although it delivers enough acidity and bite to pair with food, it might be hard to wait that long."
Kason,Chardonnay,84.0,18.0,1,"Tamarack's Firehouse Red incorporates 12 different grapes in the blend, though most are in tiny percentages. Nonetheless the wine is focused and deep, with luscious boysenberry, licorice and dark chocolate flavors wrapping together in a complex and textural whole."
Kason,Pinot Noir,87.11,37.11,9,"Betz Family's Merlot-based blend offers sleek plum and cassis fruit, with a tart, sappy, yet penetrating presence. Despite some years in bottle, the acids seem to out-run the fruit, though that may bode well for cellaring."
Kastania,Pinot Noir,86.75,41.25,4,"Sourced from old vines at the Tapteil vineyard, this somewhat austere, Cabernet-dominated blend offers a mix of tart raspberry, gun metal and grippy tannins."
Katherine Goldschmidt,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,21.0,2,"It's 40% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 25% Merlot, all from the estate vineyards. Some plum and cherry fruit starts it up, moves quickly into a light finish, and leaves an impression of some green tannins as it fades."
Kathryn Kennedy,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.5,72.5,2,"The Tempranillo—bud wood from Abacela—was grafted onto 30-year-old Cabernet Sauvignon vines. Not sure how many vintages have been made, but it's too soon to rate the experiment. This is a lightly toasty, rather elegant red with little varietal character, but it's nicely built and perfectly fine for a simple supper."
Kathryn Kennedy,Chardonnay,90.0,50.0,2,This is an appealing Cabernet with spicy cola and plum notes and a consistent flavor through the midpalate. It finishes with a hint of toasty oak.
Keating,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,55.0,1,"A very well-done Livermore Cab aged in 100% Hungarian oak and named “The Good Life,” this one's got plum and spicy cola going on and tastes young though it's a 2008. Its structure shows more potential to age—the fruit will integrate with the wine's subtle savory herbs."
Keating,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.1,68.7,10,"Spicy and salty, it's a bit like an Albariño, with little to indicate its Chardonnay varietal character. Though technically correct, it's just rather plain; in a blind tasting it could pass for almost any simple white wine."
Keating,Red Blend,87.5,55.0,2,"Soft and a little musty, this does not have the sharpness and grace of the previous vintage. Maybe just young, but at the moment it is a simple, pleasantly quaffable white wine."
Keating,Zinfandel,88.2,33.6,5,"This is a ripe year, but this vineyard designation isn't quite as tropical as their Côte Sud. It's more of a precise style, but there are also some hints of grass, onion and herb. Interesting, but very slightly off."
Keenan,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,96.0,1,"You've got to love the name (there have been Henry II, III and IV's made, with different blends of grapes). This is 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, 19% Cabernet Franc, 9% Syrah and 5% Malbec. The nose shows earth and stem first, with some sweet grape and red fruits underneath. Balanced and fruit forward, with plenty of tart acids."
Keenan,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,75.0,2,"This is a good, dark, iron-rich wine, with earth and mineral dominating through a tart finish. Interesting change of pace."
Keenan,Merlot,88.5,66.5,4,"The winery grows 17 different varietals, many in minute quantities. This is a blend of 8–12 different varietals, including such oddballs as Refosco and Freisa, along with Zin, Carignan, Tempranillo, some Cabs—in other words, it's a kitchen sink wine. Spicy and peppery, with firm acids under a forward mélange of red fruit flavors."
Keenan,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,96.0,1,"Very forward, with pretty, medium-ripe cherry flavors. The sweet fruit picks up some vanilla from the barrel, and finishes with smooth tannins. Though at first blush it seems a bit light, sweet and simple, the flavors are persistent, the balance perfect."
Kelleher,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,88.0,1,"This lightweight Zin offers an interesting mix of spices, with hints of cocoa adding complexity to the finish."
Kelleher,Chardonnay,90.0,65.0,1,"A mix of Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon. The two are blended and fermented together in barrels, from a vineyard east of Medford. The wine has pleasant herbal, grassy notes, and some very tart fruit."
Kelleher,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,30.0,2,"The fruit shows pears, some high tones, some bitter rind. The style is fruit forward, with flavors of pears and citrus, leading to a light, toasty finish."
Keller,Chardonnay,89.5,35.5,2,"A dark, deep-colored Syrah that's dusty and austere but delicious, a good representation of the variety's ability to be both ripe and complex in California."
Keller,Pinot Gris,88.0,30.0,1,"Pretty scents show pure varietal character, with the accent on fresh berries and sweet herb. Flavors follow suit, with well-managed, ripe and smooth tannins. A medium-bodied wine drinking well right now."
Keller,Pinot Noir,91.25,51.75,4,This pale pink colored wine offers appealing aromas of watermelon Jolly Rancher and cherry. It drinks off dry with mouthwatering cherry flavors.
Keller,Rhône-style Red Blend,86.0,54.0,1,"This simple wine is thick with fruit-forward dark cherry and currant elements that find companionship in coffee, graphite and dried herb accents."
Keller Estate,Chardonnay,91.25,34.25,4,"Lemon, butter and marshmallow flavors follow rich butterscotch aromas as this medium-bodied, soft-textured wine spreads its unctuous, candied flavors across the palate. It's very tasty in an extreme, buttery style."
Keller Estate,Pinot Gris,90.0,30.0,2,Stone-fruit aromas of nectarine and ripe peach drizzled with honey are followed by medium-plus sweet fruit flavors. It's a straight-forward easy drinker.
Keller Estate,Pinot Noir,88.4,53.8,5,"This Syrah, which blends 11% Counoise, is all about darkness, offering baking spice, blueberry, roast lamb, thyme, and espresso notes on the nose. It hits the palate with creamy power, its acidic backbone bolstering the pleasing tannic softness, and shows dark berry, milk chocolate, charred beef, and crushed peppercorn flavors."
Keller Estate,Rosé,90.0,22.0,1,"Caramelized black plum, teriyaki, pepper and graphite scents combine for a rich, nuanced and inviting nose on this bottling. There is beefy depth to the palate, suggesting roasted meat, hoisin sauce, plum, dried herbs and peppercorn, all unfolding in layers."
Keller Estate,Syrah-Viognier,93.0,54.0,1,"There's an intriguing mix of smokiness, tangy cranberry and sanguine notes on the nose of this bottling from a winery obsessed with the Burgundian style. The palate combines aromatic and woody flavors of juniper, pine needle, bay leaf and eucalyptus with base notes of baked red cherry. Fascinatingly, it's richer in spice than in fruit."
Kelley Fox,Pinot Noir,91.5,49.5,12,"These 15-year-old vines deliver additional complexity, further enhanced by native yeast fermentation. This is a delicate wine, but not a wimpy one. Tart berry and cranberry fruit carries a taste of toasted grain as it does a graceful fade through the finish. Give it plenty of air and it really opens up! Drink now through 2022."
Kempe,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,28.0,1,"This limited production wine advances the proposition that Pinot Gris can be substantial, complex and at least as ageworthy as the better Oregon Chardonnays. The mix of melon, white peach and lemon zest flavors, with compelling minerality, may inspire some additional cellar time. Drink now through 2024."
Ken Brown,Chardonnay,91.0,38.0,1,"Sultry cooked red plum and mulberry fruit meld with rust, mace, sarsaparilla and a touch of wood smoke on the nose of this bottling from the oldest commercial vineyard in Santa Barbara County. Smoked pork loin aromas meet with deep red fruit and the sweet tang of cherry skins on the sip."
Ken Brown,Pinot Noir,93.4,60.0,5,"Beautifully integrated oak and a firm structure combine in this rather tight but superbly balanced wine. It smells like black cherries and tastes like raspberries and blueberries, accented by toasted baguette, cinnamon and fresh cedar notes. The finish is long and lightly spicy. Best after 2018."
Ken Brown,Syrah,89.0,40.0,2,"Rich, medium dry, and loaded with lemon, orange and citrus scents and flavors, this is a marvelous wine graced with a lush, textural, mineral-drenched mouthfeel. Despite the low alcohol there is just the gentlest touch of sweetness from 8 g/L residual sugar."
Ken Wright,Chardonnay,88.0,32.5,2,"Blended with 10% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 5% Carignan, this wine displays aromas of earth, citrus peel and fresh tobacco that lead to soft, vibrant cherry flavors with light cocoa accents. It's a very pretty interpretation of the variety, with fine-grained tannins backing it up."
Ken Wright,Pinot Noir,92.45,59.4,20,"This wine impresses in its mix of stone fruit, melon and tangy passionfruit, its texture soft and velvety, marked by moderate acidity. It's a complex, lengthy white that's easy to get lost in, with or without food."
Kendall-Jackson,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.8,26.8,5,"Knowing only time in stainless steel, this light, clear white is zingy in grapefruit, wet stone and melon, its texture and body crisp and focused. The price for this quality is hard to beat."
Kendall-Jackson,Chardonnay,89.42,24.67,12,"This kitchen-sink blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Petit Verdot and Petite Sirah shows squashed black plum, caramelized blueberries, mocha and a sweet cedar touch on the nose. Toasty oak flavors carry the palate, with vanilla, brown sugar, beef char, baked blueberries and a touch of Vietnamese coffee."
Kendall-Jackson,Merlot,89.4,24.6,5,"The Emerson Block is a one-acre collection of east-west facing rows that debuted as its own wine in 2012. It exudes aromas of violets and lavender, with additional hints of white pepper, grenadine and leather, all within a bright streak of acidity."
Kendall-Jackson,Pinot Gris,88.5,15.0,2,"Black-cherry fruit is decorated with crushed thyme, dried sage, roasted meat and cinnamon on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers more cherry fruit but also a bit of black-plum-skin tartness, as well as decent amounts of asphalt and turned earth."
Kendall-Jackson,Pinot Noir,88.83,22.0,6,"Roughly half and half Marsanne and Roussanne, this dry white wine carries a distinctive scent and flavor of honey. It's round and ripe, with lemony fruit. Full-bodied and delicious, this should be enjoyed now through 2018."
Kendall-Jackson,Red Blend,89.0,17.0,4,"This is an elegant, intricate wine that's fresh and lively while layered with attractive green apple, white pepper and thyme flavors. Light bodied, it makes a great apéritif or pairing with fish and fowl."
Kendall-Jackson,Riesling,87.0,13.0,1,"Quite tart, in a bracing, food friendly way, this foot-stomped rosé brings pretty notes of crushed roses and sweet cherries to the fore. There's impressive body and length, with a lick of citrus extending the finish."
Kendall-Jackson,Sauvignon Blanc,87.33,13.0,3,"The winery's flagship offering, this wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), Cabernet Franc (25%) and Malbec. It opens with high-toned aromas of herbs and dark coffee that are followed by plush fruit flavors that taper toward the finish."
Kendall-Jackson,Syrah,88.0,17.0,2,"This Zin specialist shows she knows her way around this hearty variety as well, creating a wine that's expressive in voluptuous notions of chocolate and blackberry pie. Soft and smoky, it shows ripeness balanced by underlying acidity and a wisp of black licorice as it goes down."
Kendall-Jackson,Zinfandel,89.0,17.0,2,"This wine includes 8% Petite Sirah and smaller amounts of Petit Verdot, Syrah, Zinfandel and Merlot, fleshing out a rich, full-bodied embrace of chewy tannin and extracted blackberry and brick tar. Let it hang in the glass awhile and swirl a time or two to get it to speak."
Kendric,Pinot Noir,89.5,44.0,2,"A full-bodied, fleshy expression of the variety, this wine opens in aromas of toasted marshmallow and caramel, the oak impressive and memorable. From there it offers a wealth of baked apple and pear, finding its footing along a lush, richly defined path."
Kendric,Sangiovese,87.0,21.0,1,"This bottling comes from two Pinot clones planted within a 6.5-acre vineyard in Blucher Valley, a frigid, low-yielding site. On the edge of ripeness, the wine is unusual in orange pith, cranberry and pomegranate with a vividly tangy crispness. Soy, balsam and pine tar provide an edgy character that adds complexity and texture."
Kendric Vineyards,Viognier,89.0,24.0,2,"The second vintage by this producer from this highly regarded vineyard, this wine shows how racy the site can be, cooled from Petaluma Gap winds and fog and yet also robustly capable of ripe, rich red fruit. Measured acidity buoys a densely concentrated wine chewy and bright in pine, dark cherry, cranberry, strawberry and earth. The finish is lean and citrusy. Drink now through 2023."
Kenefick Ranch,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.5,76.25,4,"Funky on the nose in a good way, this wine is aided by 6% Viognier and 1% Roussanne. It shows roasted fennel, elderberry, grilled lamb, pencil lead and savory black pepper on the nose. The palate starts ripe with blackberries and blueberries, then evolves into thyme, oregano and marjoram, with roasted beef on the edges."
Kenefick Ranch,Cabernet Franc,87.33,51.67,3,"Dark fruit shows on the palate in this exotically spiced and floral blend from several vineyards, including Sangiacomo Roberts Road. Soft and medium in weight, it has high-toned acidity underneath the brooding spice and forest floor."
Kenefick Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.4,87.0,5,"Dark cranberry and cola scents mesh with sage and roasted fennel on the nose of this bottling, an ode to Bill Foley's Texas rancher ancestors. Cranberry and black cherry greet the palate while roasting spices of marjoram and thyme add complexity, before bright tannins and brisk tartness carry into the finish."
Kenefick Ranch,Merlot,89.0,50.0,2,"A rich and inviting nose of berry-laced pastries, dried strawberries, stewed cherries and sagebrush kick off this layered bottling. The palate shows savory cracked black pepper along with strawberry, plum and black-raspberry fruit. A dry sagebrush quality gives complexity to the whole sip."
Kenefick Ranch,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,24.0,1,"This distinctive wine has a light to medium color, with complex and somewhat earthy aromas. Very tasty and diverse flavors suggest black tea and rhubarb. It has medium body, a soothing, smooth texture and lingering finish."
Kenefick Ranch,Sauvignon Blanc,89.67,24.0,3,"The dried herb and violet aromas are high toned, seeming locked up still. The floral and smoked meat flavors are elegant in style, backed by lightly grainy tannins and a flower filled finish. The focus is on delicacy and nuance, and it brings plenty of both."
Kennedy Shah,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,52.0,1,"Dried herb notes intermingle with raspberry, cranberry, moist earth, olive and spice on a wine that has yet to truly reveal itself aromatically. The palate is pillowy soft with elegant red-fruit and smoked-meat flavors that glide on the finish. It's all about delicacy."
Kennedy Shah,Red Blend,86.0,14.0,1,"This rich and full-bodied wine is a great candidate for aging. Stash it away in a cool place until at least 2018 when its slightly rough and drying tannins should begin to mellow and let all the ripe fruit and complex spice flavors come out. It's blended with a touch of Mourvèdre for a spicy, earthy accent."
Kennedy Shah,Riesling,87.0,25.0,3,"From the producer best known for its own Anderson Valley estate wines, this Pinot is varietally rustic in pine needle, dark, baked plum and smoky oak, the oak stylistically reminiscent of many of its other wines. Mellowed acidity complements the burliness and ripeness of the fruit before a lengthy, Asian-spiced finish."
Kennedy Shah,Syrah,85.0,42.0,1,"This wine does not display the Riesling sweetness scale that's found on most Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Rieslings. This is off dry, and it has punchy peach, pear and apple flavors."
Kennedy Shah,White Blend,83.0,14.0,1,"This Rhône-style white blend has a floral highlight that leads into tart white fruit, jicama, celery and melon flavors. A light grass-like note is also apparent, and the palate could use some more concentration."
Kenneth Volk,Albariño,87.0,24.0,1,"By “Old Vine Cabernet” the winery refers to vines that were planted in 1973. But somehow the fruit doesn't express old-vine character. Instead, it's a mix of sweet-tasting strawberry and bitter stem flavors that lack focus, with a peppery highlight."
Kenneth Volk,Grenache Noir,91.0,36.0,1,"Extremely light on the nose, this bottling from a dry-farmed vineyard (that's four years deep in a drought!) offers delicate lemon peel and riverstone aromas. Light lemon curd and nectarine flavors play into a palate that's more focused on grippy texture, with some rain-on-slate minerality providing backbone."
Kenneth Volk,Malvasia Bianca,87.0,24.0,1,"Strong scents of mint and spice frame a burst of black-cherry fruit. It's followed with highlights of vanilla, coffee, cedar and mocha—suggesting that some innovative barrels were combined here. Overall, it's a potent and quite flavorful wine, ready to enjoy now through 2020."
Kenneth Volk,Verdelho,89.0,24.0,1,"Dark golden-hay in color, this white was fermented mostly in 900-gallon French oak foudres, with the remainder fermented in smaller French oak barrels. Nutty lime and gooseberry provide intrigue and saltiness against bright acidity, making for a complex and compelling impression on the palate."
Kenwood,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.71,46.57,7,"This richly concentrated wine surprises in its uplifting acidity on the back of the palate. Light, bright and full of Gravenstein apple goodness, it is well structured and refreshingly unfussy."
Kenwood,Chardonnay,88.67,26.0,3,"This bold, full-bodied and flavorful wine wraps ripe, generous blackberry flavors in a blanket of fine-grained tannins that helps support the richness and keep the wine in balance. It's from a little-known, tiny winery doing interesting things."
Kenwood,Merlot,87.0,24.33,3,"This is a new project from the Bundschu family of Gundlach Bundschu, a chance to highlight some high-quality fruit from the new Moon Mountain AVA. Toasty in oak and a hint of bacon, it's big, chewy, sanguine and rich in coffee and chocolate, with mountain-proud tannins that add structure and complexity amid the power."
Kenwood,Pinot Noir,90.0,22.0,1,"Brooding aromas of earth, herb, dried leaf, black currant, blue fruit and barrel spice are followed by focused blue and black-fruit flavors. Lightly crunchy tannins back it all up."
Kenwood,Sauvignon Blanc,93.0,22.0,1,"Smooth, chalky tannin supports deep, dark layers of tar, black currant and savory peppercorn, within a context of baked plum. Full bodied, the wine is also round and easy to love, with supportive structure making it a worthwhile bottle from the stellar appellation."
Kenwood,Syrah,92.0,27.0,1,"A step up from the '04, this is a better showcase for the cassis, blackberry and black cherry fruit from this old vine site. The balance of fruit, acid and tannin is in good proportion, and the wine is taut and slightly earthy, in a good way. The flavors gather strength and show signs of fleshing out as the wine breathes a bit."
Kenwood,Zinfandel,87.0,27.0,2,"True to past vintages, this is a peppery Syrah from a cooler site, putting the accent on very tart and tight fruit flavors of wild berries and aromatic herbs. It's well balanced and the tannins are reasonably ripe, with good grip."
Kerloo,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,50.0,1,"Ripe, premium fruit and fairly high alcohol levels define this wine. A hot year and ripe fruit combine to create complexity in the nose, with an interesting mix of spices (cardamom, clove), lots of tannin, some darker fruit, and hints of smoke and earth. The only down side: it lacks weight and it finishes very tannic."
Kerloo,Chardonnay,89.5,48.0,2,"Their estate Chardonnay is all barrel fermented. A bigger style, with lots of texture but not too much oak. Leesy, creamy, with buttery, tropical fruit. Again, well-balanced and stylish."
Kerloo,Grenache,91.0,35.67,6,"About 40% is  barrel aged and put through malolactic. This is a heavier, more substantial effort than their regular Chardonnay, with more butterscotch flavors showing. With good fruit, some weight and texture, it's well made and a good value."
Kerloo,Grenache Blanc,89.0,20.0,1,"Dijon clone again. This has just the vaguest hint of onion, but otherwise is much improved over this property's '99. There is good, juicy, crisp fruit mixing apple/apricot and light citrus. Balanced acids and a well integrated middle that leads into a somewhat hot, stiff finish. Young and edgy, but well made."
Kerloo,Malbec,92.0,42.67,3,"A hard, tannic wine, this shows concentrated raspberry fruit flavors, but does not have the fullness and texture of this winery's 2006 releases. Perhaps it's the vintage character, or maybe the wines were somehow stripped during vinification. Give it lots of aeration."
Kerloo,Mourvèdre,92.0,40.0,2,"A six-grape Rhône blend, this does not lose focus or intensity. It strikes the palate head-on with flavors of dried leaf, prune, cooked cherry, cinnamon and mocha. But despite the raisin/prune flavors, it does not seem overripe or in any way over the hill. Rather, these superripe flavors have somehow been tamed, the alcohol is just over 14%, and the wine leaves a sinuous, sensuous trail of flavor as it moves through the palate."
Kerloo,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,24.0,1,"Smooth and seductive, scented with sandalwood, tasting of butterfat, toast and chocolate, layered around generous fruit. Cherry, currant and plum lead into polished tannins and lots of chocolaty oak."
Kerloo,Rosé,88.0,22.0,1,"A new top-end series from Iris Rideau and winemaker Adrienne St. John, this bottling, named after Iris's mother who turned 98 recently, shows roasted beef, lavender, blackberry coulis and a touch of black gravel on the nose. The palate offers mole-like flavors of chocolate and dried fruit, with blueberry skin and espresso notes proving quite interesting and elegant."
Kerloo,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,22.0,1,"Made in a Méthode Champenoise style from well-farmed vineyards, this Blanc de Blancs is sharp in acidity and biting flavors of green apple and lemon zest. Crisp and fresh, it's also complex and slightly brooding, weaving in waves of brioche and almond as it goes."
Kerloo,Syrah,91.2,34.8,10,"Fresh raspberry and Bing cherry juice meet with wet black slate, rain on cement and toasted sagebrush scents on the nose of this block-selection expression. The palate opens with ripe red berry, then tightens on slightly sour cranberries, with singing acidity down the middle and a warmer anise tinge to the edges."
Kerloo,Tempranillo,91.0,34.0,1,"Hearty aromas of baking spices, roasted fennel, ginger and light licorice give nuance to dried cherry, cranberry, beef bourguignon and sweet onion scents on this wine from the eastside of the Salinas Valley. The palate is all about exotic spice, from sandalwood and myrrh to oregano, thyme, marjoram and black cardamom, all hanging on a lush, dark-fruit core."
Kessler-Haak,Chardonnay,92.0,29.0,1,"This floral wine opens as if in a damp but not wet forest, surrounded by ripe, red cherry trees. Likable from the start, it's grippy on the palate, expressively juicy, seductive and refined. Blackberry and dried herb pop on the finish, providing a darker side to the red fruit."
Kessler-Haak,Pinot Noir,91.27,37.0,11,"A rich, decadent and generous wine, 100% varietal, this is both floral and fruity, bright in cherry and raspberry alongside herbal cedar and vanilla. A medium weight surrounds softly integrated tannins, leading the way to an explosive, juicy finish. This is a classic example of the appellation's prowess in approachable power."
Kessler-Haak,Syrah,87.5,34.0,2,"Concentrated hibiscus and rose petals are cut by an iron minerality and anise character on the nose of this wine that Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton make for a Japanese partner. It's rich on the palate but still just medium weight, showing graphite, Asian spices, black peppercorns and lots of textural energy and acidic verve on the palate."
Kestrel,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,65.0,1,"This wine is sanguine and elegant despite its full-figured size. Dried cranberry and cassis play on the palate, streaked by an elusive hit of white pepper. Bright and dancing in minerality, it finishes velvety and smooth, just the right amount of toasted oak showing through."
Kestrel,Cabernet Franc,88.0,40.0,1,"From a vineyard planted in 1924 in the northern reaches of the Napa Valley, Falleri is a tiny-production wine that's soft, supple and generously juicy and fruity. Boysenberry, blackberry and a trace of crisp red fruit combine around a core of earth, dotted by a floral bouquet. The finish is long and leathery."
Kestrel,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,43.33,3,"Pungent earth opens this wine, the small-production label of Napa Valley geologist and worldwide soils expert Dr. Paul Skinner, who has named it appropriately to mark its literal roots. A strip of red berry and vanilla highlight the palate of this overall bright and balanced wine."
Kestrel,Chardonnay,86.0,21.0,2,"Aged for a year in stainless-steel barrels, this wine is a combination of two vineyard blocks. The area planted to Old Wente 5 clone contributes zesty acidity and crisp apple; the V9 vineyard block is known for minerality. Acidity is balanced and the bouquet quite floral, with the palate devoted to brioche and golden honey."
Kestrel,Gewürztraminer,85.0,17.0,1,"Earth, mud and wet clay are laid against a ripe black raspberry frame on this bottling from winemaker Larry Brooks. Plenty of life, zest and lift enliven the beautifully spiced palate, with bright red cherries, cranberries and purple flowers cut by a line of pencil-lead minerality and a savory fennel element."
Kestrel,Malbec,88.0,40.0,1,"Simply delicious, this Zin is well mannered and not too full bodied. Aromas of this dry and elegant wine are like cinnamon and cardamom, and flavors are a little smoky and full of cherries. The mouthfeel is good and gripping due to fine tannins and supportive acidity."
Kestrel,Merlot,87.5,25.0,2,"Formidable acidity gives this lovely wine a freshness around complementary layers of rose petal and strawberry-pomegranate. Made from a blend of two Chardonnay clones, it adds additional notes of tangerine and lemon-lime on the lengthy, complex finish."
Kestrel,Mourvèdre,90.0,40.0,2,"From a cool Forestville vineyard once devoted to apples, Appian Way is rich in Goldridge soils, providing a happy home to these grapes that offer a core of pomegranate and cranberry, laced in black tea. Light bodied without being wimpy, the wine is complex and velvety, finishing in nutmeg and ginger."
Kestrel,Petit Verdot,86.0,50.0,1,"Stemmy earth and dark, savory pine give in to sautéed mushroom and cinnamon in this lean, soft and delicious estate-grown wine. A tension of acidity buoys a backdrop of wild strawberry and cranberry on the palate, ending with just the right amount of weight and length, succulent to the end."
Kestrel,Pinot Grigio,86.0,17.0,1,"Smooth and rich, the first release of the new vintage from Le Cadeau is a gem. Tangy berry/cherry fruit is framed in chocolate, while balancing acidity props up softer, caramel streaks. The finish brings a wash of citrus, leaving the mouth feeling clean and ready to sip again."
Kestrel,Red Blend,88.0,23.5,4,"The vineyard from which this wine is sourced sits along the Gualala River in view of the Pacific Ocean, enjoying coastal weather and elevations of up to 1,100 feet. Baked blueberry pie laced with clove is the first impression, supported by bright acidity. Exotic in profile, it imparts cedar and tea notes, its tannins fine yet tenacious."
Kestrel,Rosé,87.0,17.0,1,"This wine opens in a flurry of pungent apple blossom and orange zest aromas. On the palate, it shows a zesty fullness of apple, Meyer lemon and lemongrass flavor, complemented by competing notions of stony minerality and lush creaminess on the finish."
Kestrel,Sangiovese,86.0,25.0,2,"As Willamette Valley vintners continually improve and redefine Oregon Chardonnay, a distinctive profile is emerging. This vivid and taut mineral-driven wine could be the poster child. The citrus, apples and pears bring a light touch of baking spices, extended length and surefire ageability. Plus, it's a fine value for a wine of such quality."
Kestrel,Sauvignon Blanc,85.0,21.0,1,"Earthy and dark fruit-driven, this is a richly rewarding, fruity wine, ripe in blackberry, clove and cocoa. From an estate vineyard named for Benovia proprietor's two mothers, Martha and Eleanor, it offers the appellation's classic elements of savory clove and cola."
Kestrel,Syrah,87.0,27.4,5,"Seared lemon, hazelnut, brown butter and sandalwood with a graphite minerality come through on the nose of this complex wine from Jonathan Nagy. The palate offers hints of herbs and chamomile at first, then washes of citrusy acidity and apple notes, all held together with steely tension."
Kestrel,Viognier,86.67,21.0,3,"A lush and expressive bottling from a brand new vineyard, this shows candied black cherry, Vietnamese coffee, baking spice and licorice on the approachable nose. The ripeness extends to the palate, hemmed in by a tannic structure that ensures long aging. Asian pepper, rum barrel, caramel and cherry flavors complete the picture."
Kestrel,White Blend,86.0,21.0,1,"This winery, with its Los Alamitos tasting room east of Long Beach, sources from a variety of vineyards to make some impressive wines. This bottling shows crushed black pepper, tar, roasted lamb and savory herb notes on the nose. The palate is tangy with underripe boysenberry, thyme, black tea and roasted lamb flavors."
Keuka Spring,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,25.0,1,"There's been lots to like from this SoCal winery, and this bottling adds to the list. Rusty in color, it offers cranberry, strawberry, sagebrush and iron aromas. The palate pops with zesty pomegranate fruit, lifted by herbal garrigue notes and spice."
Keuka Spring,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,25.0,1,"Soft yet dark aromas of alpine strawberry, blackberry, pepper and leather need time to open on this bottling's tightly packed nose. With patience, the palate releases layers of flavor, from cranberry and pomegranate to wild herb, crushed rocks and earthy spices. Drink 2018–2028."
Kevin White,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,35.0,2,"Big, powerful and confidently ripe, this full-bodied wine oozes with luscious blackberry, wild sage and blueberry flavors that seemingly melt in the mouth. A great example of the late harvest style without being sweet, it's dry, concentrated and persistent on the finish."
Kevin White,G-S-M,94.0,28.0,2,"This single-clone cuvée really shines in 2014, with concentrated berry and cherry fruit, accented with toasty oak. The persistence and follow-through takes you down a lush flavor trail, with touches of caramel, sassafras and cola along the way."
Kevin White,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,25.33,3,"Dried herb, dust and compost provide a dark underbelly in this vineyard-designated varietal wine. It's layered with caramel and toffee notes that are complemented by bright acidity and further freshened by sparks of pomegranate and cassis."
Kevin White,Syrah,91.67,28.0,3,"This bottling's nose is earthy and hearty, with rhubarb, wild berry, tea, garrigue and a touch of game all coming into play. It's soft and creamy on the palate, with dried herb notes like thyme, marjoram and mint spicing up the plum-inflected, pleasantly rustic flavors."
Kevin White,Syrah-Grenache,93.0,25.0,1,"One of the winery's many estate bottlings, this offers a floral and earthy nose, with crushed slate, lavender and ginger accents to its pomegranate and mulberry aromas. It's juicy, light and acid-driven, the palate replete with cinnamon, hibiscus and grenadine flavors, followed by a thyme- and anise-inflected finish."
Kiamie,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,38.0,1,"Chive and onion skin aromas blend with hints of mint, marcona almond and vanilla on the nose of this bottling from winemaker Bruce McGuire. From one of Pierre Lafond's special sites, it has a savory palate that recalls salted peanuts, seared lemon and popcorn on the finish. Lemony acidity cuts through it all."
Kidder Family Wines,Tempranillo Blend,88.0,24.0,1,"This best-barrel blend spent 16 months in 40% new oak, and is comprised of fruit from the Nysa and Lachini vineyards, which are also featured as vineyard designate bottlings for this new project from Mark McNeilly (of Mark Ryan Winery). The oak is showing strongly at the moment, with baking spices galore, suggesting gingerbread cookies and dried cherries. The tannins could use a bit more bottle age to soften up, but it's built to last. Drink 2020–2030."
Killian,Chardonnay,88.5,26.0,2,"The aromas are exuberant, with notes of apricot, jasmine and honeysuckle. It drinks off dry, with abundant stone-fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
King Estate,Chardonnay,87.0,17.0,3,"Popcorn, butter-fried apples, seared mandarins, marzipan and a touch of marshmallow show on the very ripe and oily nose of this bottling. The palate is thick with walnut oil, apricot, condensed jasmine and savory salts, right up the alley of those who love big Chardonnays, but not for people seeking fresher expressions."
King Estate,Pinot Gris,90.81,24.33,27,"Jack Hill is a steep, cold site near Occidental, made hearty by the winds of the Pacific Ocean. The grapes in this bottling take on a caramelized, grenadine/kirsch-like richness. Tangy cranberry and citrus, layered atop a light, bright body, are girded by an underlying juiciness."
King Estate,Pinot Noir,90.19,52.74,31,"Savory smoked-pork notes meet with blueberry soda, teriyaki and white pepper on the nose of this blend of 49% Syrah, 24% Petite Sirah, 15% Grenache and 12% Mourvèdre. Soy, teriyaki, crushed peppercorns and blackberry jam show on the palate, which is more restrained than exuberant."
King Vintners,Pinot Gris,88.0,20.0,1,"This is a hearty, tannic, big and burly wine made from a well-known vineyard in the heart of the appellation. Dense fruit flavors are framed by prominent notes of tar and leather, while a smoky char provides support and additional savory flavor."
King Vintners,Pinot Noir,87.0,40.0,1,"The aromas explode with exuberant notes of lychee, rose water, pink grapefruit and spice. The palate is medium-bodied, drinking dry with a spicy and flowery finish. The balance is impeccable."
Kings Mountain,Pinot Noir,90.5,65.0,2,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (42%), Merlot (41%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of flowers, herb, pencil lead and red fruit lead to light, flavorful, reserved and lengthy fruit flavors. The tannins are tightly wound and need some time to uncoil. Best after 2022."
Kiona,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.5,42.0,2,"Aromas of vanilla, coconut, barrel spice and dark fruit are followed by plentiful black-fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal, mixing fruit and barrel."
Kiona,Cabernet Franc,88.0,35.0,1,"This blends 75% Cabernet Sauvignon with 25% Petite Verdot, the Cabernet hailing from vineyards such as To Kalon and Dr. Crane. This wine is defined by its ripeness, a high-octane expression of coconut and soy with a syrupy concentration of blackberry and cherry that explodes with richness on the palate."
Kiona,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,45.67,3,"The first release from a new resort winery on Lake Osoyoos. Katy Perry, of Tildio, is the winemaker. This is a bright, high-toned blend of Barbera, Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc aged 22 months in French and American oak barrels. Flavors of strawberry, Bing cherry and milk chocolate highlight a wine of medium weight and depth."
Kiona,Chenin Blanc,91.8,27.8,5,"Almost all varietal with just a dash of Cabernet Sauvignon (5%) to fill it out, this is an intriguing wine with notes of cherry cordial, chocolate and herbs. With very little new oak influence, the soft, supple fruit flavors are allowed to shine through, giving this wine a real sense of polish."
Kiona,Lemberger,89.5,15.0,4,"American and Hungarian oak barrels were used, adding a rustic, powerful base to this pure Primitivo. Think Zinfandel crossed with Lemberger and you're in the ballpark of its style. Its raw, big-boned flavors of fruit and barrel are ready for a juicy steak."
Kiona,Malbec,89.5,32.5,2,"A tasty, sweet and sour blend of Chardonnay, Riesling, Viognier and Pinot Gris, this has bountiful fruit flavors of peach and pear. It's a big, forward, generous, though ultimately simple, white wine, with more than a touch of sweetness."
Kiona,Merlot,88.0,25.0,2,"Textural and leesy, this refreshing Chardonnay also has a pretty, toasty nose. The mouthfeel and barrel notes compensate for the rather light, generic fruit."
Kiona,Muscat,88.0,7.0,1,"This is Riesling done in a forward and fruity style, showing a mix of peach, apple and pear flavors. Broad and accessible, it finishes with a sweet dusting of powdered sugar."
Kiona,Red Blend,89.0,23.0,1,"This is a strong wine, dark and oaky, with rich flavors of licorice, toffee and espresso. The fruit is washed in Bourbon barrel flavor. It's impressively rich, but a bit overpowering."
Kiona,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,40.0,2,"The Horse Heaven Vineyard adds a welcome touch of minerality to the plain apple fruit flavor of the wine. It is this minerality that elevates it a notch, giving it a textural and refreshing mouthfeel."
Kiona,Riesling,88.17,13.5,6,"This is a tangy, berry-powered blend. Hard not to like the fresh, zippy, highly acidic flavors of tart raspberries; flavors that are sharp and almost crunchy, but deliciously vibrant. This is what Dry Creek Zinfandel used to taste like before it turned into rocket fuel."
Kiona,White Riesling,88.0,7.0,1,"This is the winery's third vintage, and they continue to make elegant, supple and snappy wines. This is the ripest to date, and has a healthy 14.7% alcohol level, but it retains many of the spice and herbal highlights that keep it interesting. The fruit brings on berries, plums and some of the brambly character of Zinfandel; the barrels add clove and nutskins. Cola and sassafras wrap into the sharp finish."
Kirkland Signature,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.5,19.17,6,"Brandborg has established a style that is well-suited to the locale, and their Pinots are perfectly balanced and mix in spices and fresh herbs with the tart, cool climate fruit. This is a crisp, unpretentious style of Oregon Pinot."
Kirkland Signature,Chardonnay,89.33,13.0,3,"This is an interesting bottle from sourced fruit (rather than estate-grown). Ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit is matched to ripe tannins; the wine is dark, almost sultry, and the flavors flow seamlessly across the palate. There is a spicy lift and a hint of pickle barrel (American oak?) that concludes the presentation."
Kirkland Signature,Merlot,87.0,15.0,1,"This blend of grapes from three different Columbia Gorge vineyards is immediately appealing, with round, smoky, relatively soft and accessible flavors. It's smooth and seductive, offering bright cherry fruit augmented with that smoky streak and a whiff of tobacco in the finish."
Kirkland Signature,Red Blend,89.5,17.0,4,"This wine comes from grapes grown in Green Valley's Mill Station, Sullivan, Walker Hill and Rued vineyards. High-toned to the last drop, it shows Gravenstein apple and Meyer lemon flourishes, with a subtle backbone of oak."
Kirkland Signature,Zinfandel,90.0,10.0,1,"This uniquely styled wine has flinty, earthy aromas that recall forest floor and dried mushrooms and savory beef broth, black pepper and tamarind flavors, backed by olive and plum. It's great to see an interesting wine like this one push the envelope for Rhône varieties in California."
Kitchen Sink,Red Blend,85.0,15.0,1,"This complex, tightly wound effort from a four-acre block planted to a single clone tastes of luxurious caramel and toasted oak, its flavors superimposed over a backdrop of forest-like scents."
Kitá,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,50.0,2,"Tightly woven and deeply concentrated, this brawny, full-bodied wine from the mighty mountain site boasts expansive tannins. Firm acidity invigorates its spectrum of flavors that range from cherry, marshmallow and clove to forest and tobacco."
Kitá,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.5,40.0,2,"One of the producer's new single-vineyard wines, this shines with savory leather, black pepper and spicy red-fruit flavors. Layered and compact, it has an underlying grip of tannin, ultimately finishing soft and easy on the palate."
Kitá,Chardonnay,93.0,30.0,1,"This beautifully ripe and juicy wine adds a hint of menthol to the ripe black currant and black cherry aromas and delivers round, rich fruit impressions on the palate. It has a lush mouthfeel, mild tannins and a clean, fruity finish. Cabernet Franc makes up 40% of the blend, along with Petit Verdot, Malbec and Syrah."
Kitá,Grenache,91.0,18.0,1,"This is all Pommard clone, with a tart racy mix of cranberry and raspberry fruit. It's juicy and young, with sharp, precise edges. Tannins remain slightly bitter, but a couple more years in bottle should fix that."
Kitá,Grenache Blanc,92.0,22.0,1,"A good example of the late-harvest approach, this indulgent wine has strawberry syrup aromas, crushed raspberry and blackberry flavors, great concentration and a high level of ripeness. Drink it in lieu of dessert."
Kitá,Pinot Noir,90.0,55.0,2,"This wine was made by fermenting the skins and juice of several white Rhône varieties and Rolle, also known as Vermentino, together. It has a brassy color and more textural elements than usual for a white. Orange peel and toasted almond aromas are followed by dry white peach and white pepper flavors and a firm mouthfeel due to some tannin. With time, it opens up and tastes wonderful in an unorthodox way. Best after 2020."
Kitá,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,30.0,2,"This single clone estate-grown wine was vinified 50-50 in stainless and mainly neutral oak. It's classic, classy and clean, with well-delineated components. Green melon, apple and citrus, along with ample acid and some phenolic bite are in harmonious balance. Another year or two in the bottle could improve it still further."
Kitá,Rhône-style White Blend,88.33,22.0,3,"From a ranch planted many decades ago, this wine includes mixed blacks such as Grand Noir and Carignane, adding juicy red and black fruit to the mix. Smoke, cinnamon and leather highlights are kept firm by an integrated tannic structure."
Kitá,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,24.0,2,"This wine seems quite reduced out of the gate, delivering aromas that prove distracting. The palate shows more depth with an array of pleasing dark fruit flavors."
Kitá,Syrah,88.5,30.0,2,"Vanilla, coconut and baking spice aromas are at the fore, with the wood primary. The palate is rich and full bodied, with dark fruit and oak spice flavors. There are some good things going on but the oak—half new American and half seasoned French—rides right over them."
Kivelstadt Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,86.0,35.0,1,"This wine's unusual purple fruit, citrus, herb and wood spice aromas waft up from the glass. The palate brings abundant orange peel flavors supported by tannins that are surprisingly firm for the variety. Citrus twist notes linger on the finish."
Kivelstadt Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,20.0,1,"Faint white flower, orange peel, spice and citrus aromas are followed by broad fruit flavors in this wine, which lacks concentration."
Kivelstadt Cellars,Syrah,92.0,45.0,1,"This blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Syrah and 20% Zinfandel is a little simple at first on the nose, with loamy soil and tart elderberry aromas eventually apparent. It's quite dry on the sip, with dried oregano and marjoram, and then come flavors of black fruit, graphite and black pepper."
Kivelstadt Cellars,White Blend,91.0,25.0,1,Stillwater Creek Vineyard was the source for this lightly spicy Sangiovese. Sour cherry candy and cayenne chocolate flavors combine gracefully in a wine that is balanced and crafted for near-term enjoyment.
Klinker Brick,Red Blend,89.5,25.0,2,"Modeled on a Right Bank, Bordeaux-style blend, this is 75% Merlot. It's supple and fruity, with ripe, balanced tannins. The wine does not have as much weight and depth as many Red Mountain reds, but it's well-balanced and suitable for drinking over the next few years."
Klinker Brick,Rosé,89.0,15.0,1,"There's a tropical element to this Cab, which otherwise traffics in bright red cassis and cranberry. The tannins are still resolving but tend to the softer side, woven tightly through to the finish."
Klinker Brick,Syrah,89.29,26.43,7,"A lovely sunset blush color, this is 100% estate-grown Syrah. It was picked and pressed specifically for this rosé—not a saignée style. Soft and smooth, it has generous strawberry fruit and touches lightly on tropical notes as well."
Klinker Brick,Zinfandel,88.4,28.3,10,"Highlighted in cherry-vanilla and toasty oak, this wine is structured and brimming in juicy red fruit."
Knapp,Riesling,85.0,11.0,2,"This Chardonnay already shows quite a bit of age. Hazelnut and chestnut dominate the nose with burnt lemon peel acidity at the edges. The palate picks up roasted marshmallow and roasted nut flavors, followed by a toffee finish. Drink now."
Knight Hill,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,28.0,1,"The aromas pop, with notes of sliced green pepper and jalapeño pepper, leaning very hard into the green. The palate brings more of the same, drinking more like a Carmenere than a Cabernet."
Knight Hill,Red Blend,88.0,23.0,1,"Sweet and spicy, this medium-bodied Zinfandel-based wine smells like strawberries and tastes like vanilla, nutmeg and cherry syrup. It is soft in texture, low in acidity and characterized by spicy oaky nuances."
Knight Hill,Syrah,88.0,25.0,1,"Mildly fruity and very smooth in texture, this wine is quietly agreeable. It is medium to full bodied, feels rich on the palate and tastes ripe and subtle like honeydew melon."
Knights Bridge,Chardonnay,90.5,57.5,2,"An overtly fruity aroma and lightly sweet citrus flavors make this medium-bodied wine easy to enjoy. It tastes fresh and clean, and is rich enough to calm down spicy foods like Thai or Mexican."
Knights Bridge,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,40.0,1,"A very ripe white Rhone style, this blend of 59% Roussanne, 28% Grenache Blanc and 13% Viognier offers peach custard, browned butter, seared banana and strong white flower aromas, from tuberose and honeysuckle into daffodil. Golden apples, walnut oil and ripe yellow peach and walnut oil flavors combine for a lush, unctuous palate."
Kobler,Chardonnay,90.5,50.0,2,"This vineyard-designate pushes the envelope in terms of ripeness, opting to go for a restrained, low-alcohol style. It retains a streak of menthol through a juicy red core of strawberry and oak-toasted tannin, finishing lean."
Kobler,Grenache,88.75,32.5,4,"This wine tastes like a rosé Champagne without the bubbles. It has a classic light salmon color, light aromas like white cherries and raspberries, and a surprisingly layered texure that curls around the tongue. And what a great value, too."
Kobler,Pinot Noir,91.0,38.0,2,"A small addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot don't rein in any of this wine's significant power, highlighted in plummy licorice and inviting aromas of chocolate that mellow on the palate, revealing a thick and rich explosion of ripeness with a concentrated finish."
Kobler,Syrah,91.5,43.0,2,"There are some toasty, Graham cracker highlights in the nose, leading into a full, round wine with lemon verbena accents. Fruity, soft and broad, with apple and melon."
Kobler,Viognier,89.5,37.0,2,"This is a Rhône-style blend of mostly Grenache and Syrah, with smaller amounts of Viognier and Cinsault. The wine opens with appealing spices, but turns tart and stemmy in the mouth. The spiced plum fruit flavors compete somewhat unsuccessfully with bitter tannins. More bottle age should help."
Koehler,Grenache,90.67,23.0,3,"An austere, savory Zin from Amador, one of the smaller-production Zinfandels from Renwood and it shows. Firm tannins, dusty black fruit and spice—a good option for Sierra Foothills Zin fans."
Koi Pond,Red Blend,86.0,19.0,1,"Silky in high-toned flavors of red cherry, this is light and enjoyable. A memorable jolt of acidity on the finish nicely ties things up and gives the wine a mouthwatering quality."
Kokomo,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,43.5,2,"A pink-tinged copper color and a pleasing blend of flavors make this sparkling wine from Schramsberg easy to enjoy. The aromas suggest cherries and cinnamon, the flavor is like tart raspberry and the texture is smooth with fine bubbles."
Kokomo,Chardonnay,89.25,36.5,4,"An intriguing wine with notes of dried apricot, lees and honeycomb. The throttle is pulled back in terms of feel while it still possesses a lot of richness to the fruit flavors and an impressively long finish."
Kokomo,Grenache,88.0,24.0,1,"A 50-50 sparking blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes given more time in bottle, the DVX is light golden in color. Yeasty on the nose and dry on the palate, it offers a flurry of rich, full-bodied apple and wild berry layered atop a thick layer of minerality."
Kokomo,Malbec,90.0,38.0,1,"From a limestone-laden vineyard 25 miles east of the cool Monterey Bay comes a solid wine redolent with notes of black cherry, toasted sage, cedar and cinnamon. It's big and tannic on the palate, with flavors of blackberry syrup, black licorice and espresso."
Kokomo,Merlot,89.0,34.0,1,"Rose petals and strawberries combine in the floral nose, then are underscored with bracing minerality. There's just a wisp of sweetness to leaven the acids."
Kokomo,Pinot Noir,90.0,45.33,6,"A beguiling wine with notes of green apple, slate and botrytis. It drinks off dry with tart, mouthwatering acidity. The concentration isn't all there throughout but there is still much to enjoy."
Kokomo,Primitivo,87.0,42.0,1,"Pale in color, this wine is aromatically quiet with notes of berry and herb, while the smoke notes emerge over time. The flavors are full and juicy but still bring a sense of delicacy, with a lingering finish. Give it time to open up."
Kokomo,Red Blend,93.0,26.0,2,"Rustic aromas of crushed rocks and chewing tobacco pair interestingly with more floral elements of rose petal, lilac and wisteria on the nose of this bottling. Coffee and tobacco flavors show on the palate, where muddy tannins present leathery flavors of dark red cherries. It shows its long barrel aging with pride."
Kokomo,Rosé,89.71,22.0,7,"This rich wine smells sweet and tastes jammy, as strawberry and boysenberry flood the palate. Full body and a smoothly dense texture complete the picture."
Kokomo,Sauvignon Blanc,86.5,21.0,2,"This is a doughy, dusty wine, the tannins provocative in length and grip. Blackberry, chocolate and graphite swirl around a ripe center, the texture smooth and firm. On the finish is a steady back beat of oak."
Kokomo,Zinfandel,91.22,35.56,9,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (55%), Merlot (17%), Cabernet Franc (10%), Petit Verdot (9%) and Malbec. Pleasing aromas of baking spice, cocoa and vanilla lead to a well-proportioned palate, full of dark-fruit flavors that show a reserved styling."
Kontos,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,40.0,1,"Syrah makes up three-quarters of this wine with Grenache (20%) and Syrah accounting for the rest. It's fragrant with aromas of raspberry, cherry, herb and allspice that lead to plush, downright jammy fruit flavors that still show a deft touch."
Kontos,Malbec,91.25,40.25,4,"Cigar box, café au lait, and dried tobacco aromas are followed by coffee and cherry flavors, with barrel spices lingering on the finish. The wood gets a bit out front but it still delivers enjoyment."
Kontos,Red Blend,90.71,43.71,7,"Cigar box, café au lait, and dried tobacco aromas are followed by coffee and cherry flavors, with barrel spices lingering on the finish. The wood gets a bit out front but it still delivers enjoyment."
Kontos,Syrah,89.2,40.2,5,"This substantial wine is full bodied, robust in flavor and firmly textured due to ample fine-grained tannins. The fruit flavors are tempting and ripe, while accents of black pepper and dried herbs add complexity."
Kontos,White Blend,88.0,24.83,6,"This fleshy white has a tropical ripeness that almost appears sweet, set against a prodigious use of caramelized oak. Tart lemon and apple complement in crispness within a boldly textured body."
Kopriva,Chardonnay,89.5,19.0,2,"The aromas of coffee, red currant and red plum are bright and effusive, with tar and cough medicine notes in the background. The cherry flavors are plush and full, with coffee notes lingering on the finish."
Korbel,Champagne Blend,82.0,14.0,1,"Coming from a slightly warmer part of the Central Coast, this bottling plays to the dried fruit and earthy side of the grape, with cranberry, hibiscus, turned loam and pencil shavings on the nose. Dense black-plum flavors show on the palate alongside crushed lava rocks, turned soil, juniper and dried pine needles."
Korbel,Sparkling Blend,87.77,14.15,13,"Aromas of green wood, herb and blackberry lead to full-bodied fruit flavors that provide appeal. The tannins bring some astringency."
Korbin Kameron,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,84.0,85.0,1,"This blend of Petite Sirah, Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre offers a wide array of aromas to start, from cocoa and mocha to brown spice, gingerbread, dark purple fruits and potpourri. The palate shows lavender, blueberry-strawberry juice, roasted oregano and thyme."
Korbin Kameron,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,55.0,1,"The aromas are bright, with raspberry, licorice, green pepper and medicinal notes. The flavors are lighter in style and show a distinct green tinge that provides some distraction."
Korbin Kameron,Merlot,88.0,40.0,1,"This pretty expression of Cabernet Franc delivers notes of carob, flowers and maraschino cherry. It's lighter in style with tart flavors and quite chalky tannins."
Kriselle,Red Blend,87.0,25.75,4,"Many vineyards were sourced for this dry rosé, made from a selection of Pinot Noir clones. Beautifully pale rose petal color, its aromas and flavors lean herbal before fresh notes of raspberry and strawberry set in. The finish is intense."
Krupp Brothers,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.5,117.5,2,"This smells considerably more developed than its age would indicate, with notes of dried cranberries and cherries mixed with barrel spices and game. The palate brings more heft than expected at the labeled alcohol level, with abundant cranberry flavors throughout."
Krupp Brothers,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.25,122.5,4,"This falls on the light side, with appealing flavors of strawberry and cherry candy. The tannins are just thick enough to give an edge. It's rare to find vineyard-designated Pinots in this price range."
Krupp Brothers,Chardonnay,88.0,65.0,3,"Made from 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Noir, this is a young, light sparkler with developed flavors of honey, lychee and apple. The body is crisp and medium in weight, and it finishes tart in lemon."
Krupp Brothers,Red Blend,90.67,87.5,6,"Sourced from a host of vineyards, many of them in Sonoma County, this is an intensely dark, weighty Chardonnay with a taste of sour lemon and apple, rich in oak with a clean finish."
Krupp Brothers,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,65.0,1,"This Bordeaux-style blend is bone dry and scented strongly with dried leaves, earth and herbs. The lightly-ripened fruit suggests pomegranate and rhubarb."
Krupp Brothers,Rosé,90.0,38.0,1,"This is roughly a 50-50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, showing a heavy concentration of vanilla flavor, often the mark of oak alternatives during the fermentation process. Some licorice notes come through, although the fruit is rather thin and herbal—not unexpected at this price."
Krupp Brothers,Syrah,92.0,75.0,1,"Barbera topping 16% abv is a bit surprising, but despite this, the wine does not deliver much fruit power. It's chalky, hot and tannic, with the alcohol overpowering the simple red fruit."
Krutz,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.33,48.33,3,"Though no residual sugar is listed, this appears to have a hint of sweetness, along with light fruit flavors of strawberry and candied cherries."
Krutz,Chardonnay,87.33,28.33,3,"The artist label Syrah is usually Dunham's best, as this vineyard is well-established as one of the premier sites in Washington for Syrah. Scents of violets and black cherry introduce a dense, hard, tightly wound, muscular effort that needs a generous amount of breathing time. It rolls through the palate on a train of well-defined fruit, spice and chocolate, all nicely integrated. Supple and long."
Krutz,Malbec,92.0,55.0,1,"They grow powerful grapes in parts of Amador County and this one stands out for its elevated alcohol. The mix of 70% Zinfandel and smaller helpings of Mourvèdre, Barbera, Syrah and Touriga combine for a spicy cola taste. Leathery notes and big tannins linger long on the finish."
Krutz,Merlot,86.0,25.0,1,"As imposing as the athlete himself, this is an impressive wine from the get-go, high in acidity and the resulting bright cassis and red berry fruit. It's nuanced in pretty ways, with peppercorn, herb and chalky tannins. Lingering on the palate, the structure suggests significant aging potential; enjoy from 2021–2024."
Krutz,Pinot Noir,88.0,35.0,2,"This very substantive wine carries rich and complex flavors on a firm and lively frame. It has an exotic, perfumed aroma, and plenty of fruit flavor and firm tannins. The elements of ripe cherries, suave oak and vibrant acidity all support each other for great balance and a long finish."
Krutz,Syrah,90.0,35.0,1,"Pure Pinot from the winery's estate O'Connell Vineyard, planted to one clone, this is a tremendous celebration of the grape, fresh in cherry and raspberry and pillowed by gentle wafts of rose petal. Light on the tongue and yet girded by enough structure to age and enjoy over time, this wine is simply delicious."
Kudos,Pinot Noir,88.0,28.6,5,"Vibrantly intoxicating wafts of varietal pepper and violets are complemented by gorgeous layers of blackberry, raspberry and smoky, gamy meat. The acidity marks the palate most, however, lifting the wine's denseness of concentration into a more complex and interesting place. Made in small quantities, this wine is ready to enjoy but will age through 2021, as well."
Kuleto Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.4,74.0,5,"A blend of Klipsun and Ciel du Cheval vineyards aged in 50% new French oak, this wine brings brooding notes of blackberry bramble, blueberry, mineral, herbs and potpourri. The palate-coating blue-fruit flavors are exceptionally dense, rich and sweet and lead to a hyper-extended finish."
Kuleto Estate,Chardonnay,85.0,45.0,2,"Light and floral, this subtle dessert wine is made from Scheurebe grapes, more often found in Austria than California. It provides this wine with fresh apricot and honey on the palate, lingering yet low enough in alcohol and power to be enjoyed as either apéritif or digestif, its sweetness greatly restrained."
Kuleto Estate,Red Blend,88.86,42.86,7,"This is a big and complex wine by Napa-turned-Paso winemaker David Galzignato. Dense aromas suggest ripe plums, black licorice, vanilla and mint. Flavors are juicy with purple fruits and grounded with herbs and mint, all hanging on an excellent tannic structure that's substantial but not pushy."
Kunde,Barbera,86.0,30.0,2,"From the Thomas LaTour Vineyards on Mount Veeder, this wine is half barrel fermented and half aged in stainless steel, making for a balanced, full-bodied expression of the variety. Apple and stony mineral notes linger, with hints of butterscotch on the finish."
Kunde,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,100.0,1,"This blend of Pommard, Coury and Dijon 667 clones shows bright cherry fruit, bedecked with lovely spices. It's round and forward, with medium weight and depth."
Kunde,Cabernet Franc,86.0,42.0,1,"Reduced and extracted, this old-vine wine is smooth and velvety, powerfully made to reflect rich, ripe red berry and a layering of brown sugar. The finish is lean and reminiscent of black licorice."
Kunde,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,48.25,4,"Deemed “The Imaginary One,” this bottling shows a combination of spice and fruit on the nose, with gingersnap, red berry and strawberry aromas. There's woody complexity on the crisp and clean palate, with cedar, incense, sandalwood, star anise and clove set against a red berry and fruit-punch frame."
Kunde,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,86.0,28.0,1,"The Beckett brothers' 50-50 blend of Tempranillo and Zinfandel is one of their top wines, and it lives up to its reputation, with plump black cherry, baked plum and campfire aromas. The palate is softly layered with chalky tannins that carry waves of berry-powered acidity as well as savory notes of teriyaki, chocolate ganache and minty freshness on the finish."
Kunde,Chardonnay,89.0,36.67,6,"Blackberry candies, purple flowers, black tea and hints of shaved dark chocolate show on the nose of this blend of 65% Syrah, 25% Mourvèdre and 10% Grenache. A zesty acidity kicks off the sip, then a tannic structure emerges, with thoroughly integrated flavors of pressed violet, dense blueberry jelly, tart olallieberry and a burned-caramel edge."
Kunde,Malbec,87.0,35.0,2,"Not a showy wine, but this is well balanced, aromatic, flavorful and feels right on the palate. It smells like red cherries and black plums, and tastes fruity with spicy undertones. A touch of tannin and a dash of good acidity give it poise."
Kunde,Meritage,88.0,35.0,1,"From two estate vineyards, this wine is sleepy and subdued at first. Gradually warming in the glass, it becomes velvety and concentrated in black and red fruit, with dashes of clove and oak filling in the full-bodied palate. Structured and approachable, it also has a lengthy finish."
Kunde,Merlot,82.0,17.0,1,"This wine starts out brawny and tannic before finding itself in a more vibrant light of cherry, cinnamon and dried herb. Aromatically, it's a field of violets on a spring day, backed by a complex structure that makes for a food-friendly companion that's fresh from start to finish."
Kunde,Red Blend,90.0,28.0,1,"Spicy strawberry and cherry hover over forest floor and a tangle of tangy acidity that keeps this wine fresh and vibrantly compelling. Full bodied and robust, it maintains a balance in the glass, making it both food-friendly and an option on its own."
Kunde,Sauvignon Blanc,88.4,20.2,5,"This Merlot requires some extended breathing time before opening up. The fruit sources include Cold Creek, Canoe Ridge and the Wahluke Slope, bringing lush cherry/berry fruit to the fore, ripened to a level just below jammy. The tannins carry a hint of green, turning a little rough in the finish."
Kunde,Syrah,90.0,25.0,2,"Fully ripe fruit flavors are accented by light toast and spice notes in this full-bodied and extremely smooth-textured wine. Dense ripe blackberry and dark chocolate flavors seem to coat the palate, and moderate tannins provide good grip."
Kunde,Viognier,88.0,23.5,2,"Fresh aromas of dark violets, sweet lavender, elderberry and a light teriyaki glaze show on the nose of this extra barrel-aged bottling. It's medium bodied on the palate, where dark fruits meet with elderflower and more purple flowers. It's still a bit reserved."
Kunde,White Blend,90.0,75.0,1,"Exuberantly fruity, this full-bodied wine smells and tastes like black-cherry juice, and is nicely dry on the palate. Good fruit acidity and moderate tannins balance all the fruit concentration and high alcohol level."
Kunde,Zinfandel,86.86,37.0,7,"Forest and pine give this wine an edgy, earthy and ethereal core that's dotted in notions of baked strawberry. Sizable oak and tannin structure add weight and power from a concentrated year."
Kuyam,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,30.5,2,"This wine has overlapping personalities. One drips richly in vanilla and honey, while the other is lemony tart and electric in acidity. They commingle on the finish, and will clearly decide whether to get along or part over time. Give the wine a good swirl."
Kynsi,Chardonnay,93.0,26.0,1,"This new cuvée brings forward, spicy, peppery fruit centered around cranberry flavors. The back end tannins turn earthy, and take the shine off the finish. Perhaps a bit more bottle age will open it up."
Kynsi,Pinot Blanc,90.0,22.0,1,"Fans of sharply scented Sauvignon Blancs will be happy with this bottling, which features a strong nose of green pear skin and freshly cut lawn. It is fairly flat upon sipping, though, with a bit of Granny Smith apple tang and faint lemongrass."
Kynsi,Pinot Noir,92.7,46.8,10,"Fresh smells of blue raspberry and black licorice characterize the nose. On the palate, it's heavily tannic, beginning with some cherry before becoming distractingly grippy. Hold until 2017."
Kynsi,Red Blend,93.0,39.0,2,"Pale yellow pink in color, this is one of the better rosés of the vintage, showing lush but restrained aromas of peach crème fraîche along with lemon zest and crushed limestone. There is fabulous energy and texture on the sip, where chalky flavors meet with red apple and a hint of rosewater."
Kyra,Dolcetto,87.0,20.0,1,"There is an impressively persistent stony quality to the nose and palate of this bottling. On the nose, that takes the form of a rainy cement note, which, along with lime-skin and pith scents, give fresh tension to the broad peach and pear aromas. On the palate, it's all about grippy texture, which holds up green apple, underrripe pluot and lime-wedge flavors."
Kyra,Red Blend,87.0,15.0,1,"This blend is part of a new label for Syrah master Joey Tensley, and it's actually far more accessible at this young age than his more expensive bottlings. Fascinating aromas of game, animal hide and tar meet with black currant and elderberry on the nose. There is a strong density and tannic frame to the palate, where flavors of bay leaf, thyme and pepper spice up the undercurrent of elderberry and black plum skins."
Kyra,Sangiovese,85.0,20.0,1,"This is a very opulent bottling by Steve Martell, who blends 83% Syrah, 16% Grenache and 1% Mourvèdre to deliver aromas of black-plum sauce, hot licorice, hoisin and buttery pie crust. Rounded milk chocolate flavors show on the sip, melted atop the rich and ripe core of black cherry and cassis. It's a tad hot on the tongue."
L'Ecole No. 41,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.23,54.23,13,"Gorgeous, with a golden apple nose, this wine is voluptuously rich, rewarding and full bodied, with creamy waves of vanilla and melon. Big and bold on the midpalate, it finishes in a twist of salty Meyer lemon. 100% Dijon 95 clone."
L'Ecole No. 41,Bordeaux-style White Blend,90.67,21.33,3,"Well-integrated oak, deliciously ripe fruit flavors and an absolutely luscious texture make a great combination for this very full-bodied wine. The entry is smooth and light, then the flavors of ripe plum and boysenberry build on the palate, very mouth filling and rich, before lingering on a long finish."
L'Ecole No. 41,Cabernet Sauvignon,95.0,60.0,1,"Lush cassis aromas are cut by black pepper and charcoal on the nose of this bottling by Las Vegas sommelier-turned-winemaker Paolo Barbieri, who was raised in Rome. It's still young and tightly wound on the palate, but slowly unfurls boisterous blackberry fruit, thyme and pepper, with sticky firm tannins and a strong acidity from front to back."
L'Ecole No. 41,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,91.0,39.0,1,"All five Bordeaux varieties make an appearance in this blend, which offers deep and brooding aromas of black olive, graphite, tobacco, cigar box and elderberry on the nose. There is strong black pepper and charred beef on the sip but also a pleasant purple-fruit jam that arises midpalate, with pencil shavings all around. The tannins are soft and the finish is minty."
L'Ecole No. 41,Chenin Blanc,89.67,15.0,3,"Stewed cherry, exotic cardamom and mace spices and hints of juniper and bay leaf bring an earthy component to the nose of this Pinot. Dark cranberry and black-plum-skin flavors meet with earth tones of turned loam, pine needle and menthol on the palate."
L'Ecole No. 41,Grenache,88.0,21.0,2,"This lovely blend of 58% Chardonnay and 42% Pinot Noir is impressive in its doughy, refined sensibilities and in its distinct aromas of apple and orange blossom. Bright strawberry rides atop layered acidity and enviable length, while the palate creamy and refined. This is a vegan wine."
L'Ecole No. 41,Merlot,91.17,36.33,6,"Cooked cherry meets with nutmeg, allspice, white pepper and a strong sandalwood scent on the nose of this red from the south side of the appellation. The woody cedar-driven spice notes show strong on the sip, giving depth to the mulberry and rainbow-peppercorn flavors."
L'Ecole No. 41,Red Blend,90.0,23.0,1,"This well-made, crisply styled wine is zesty in lime and stony minerality, with a background grasp of the sea. Briny, it has well-manicured layers of toasty oak, green apple and persistent acidity—a wise choice for the table."
L'Ecole No. 41,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,90.67,20.33,3,"Light and chalky aromas of lemon peel, yeast and white flowers are pure and inviting on the nose of this bottling by regional sparkling pioneer Norm Yost. Clean lines of lime peel and rounded hints of nectarine show on the very pleasing and non-aggressive palate."
L'Ecole No. 41,Syrah,91.0,36.67,6,"This blend of Cabernet Franc (46%), Merlot (28%), Cabernet Sauvignon (17%) and Petit Verdot (9%) starts out brooding, with black cherry, herb, black currant, anise, and spice notes. The palate is rich and structured, loaded with dark fruit flavors and firm tannins. Give it some time to open up."
L'Ecole No. 41,Sémillon,91.0,20.0,1,"Intensely dark aromas of black currant, char, roast beef and a slight bit of gamy funk show on the very masculine nose of this bottling by San Jose-based vintner Adam Comartin. There is bountiful acidity on the sip and thick mouthcoating tannins, allowing the black fruit and caramel flavors to penetrate deep into the finish."
L'Oliveto,Chardonnay,89.0,20.0,1,"This wine brings high-toned aromas of white flower, lychee and spice. The palate is broad and light, with a distracting bitter note on the finish."
L'Ptit Paysan,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,22.0,1,"This is a sweet wine, floral in aroma, rich in texture and sugary in flavor that tastes like watermelon and pink lemonade. It's light in alcohol, fruity and straightforward."
LJ Crafted Wines,Pinot Noir,88.0,39.0,1,"There is so much wood on the nose of this bottling that it smells like an oak stave mill, with shaved cedar and maduro cigar touches dominating the black-currant and elderberry fruit. That cedar is powerful on the sip too, with a touch of black-cherry fruit managing to pop out along with dried herbs."
LVE,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,85.0,1,"From an estate property, this is among the winery's top bottlings every year. In this stellar vintage it shows well in a mix of cranberry and dense earth. Tightly wound and still a touch chewy in tannin weight, the oak is present yet integrated, allowing the ripe fruit to shine."
LVVR,Sparkling Blend,86.0,20.0,1,"A mix of clones 115, 177 and Pommard, this tart, tightly wound wine brings cranberry, black cherry and red-licorice flavors together. There's ample acidity, yet it remains in balance, with good focus and length."
LXV,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,65.0,1,"Plum and blackberry shout from the glass, wrapping around an oaky, leathery texture and hits of smoky char and vanilla. This full-bodied wine finds a groove of balance as it goes, adding a lengthy streak of pepper on the finish."
LXV,Chenin Blanc,85.0,35.0,1,"As with many of Oregon's 2013 Pinots, this is more refined, more austere, more herbal and lower in alcohol than the fruity, forward 2012s. It's a matter of personal preference which is preferable. The fruit here begins in rhubarb and runs to raspberry, with a stop for citrus peel along the way. Spicy highlights of clove and coriander roll into a bright finish."
LXV,Red Blend,88.67,53.0,3,"This sultry wine is sourced from the producer's Trenton Road vineyard, cooler than where the winery itself sits in Chalk Hill. Planted to six clones, it provides this bottling with a taste of blueberry and raspberry integrated around soft, juicy tannins and a brightness of acidity."
LXV,Rosé,85.5,27.0,2,"Each Le Cadeau wine has a different consulting winemaker. Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) made this generously toasty wine. Bright fruit flavors bring berry and cherry forward, though in this young wine they are not yet completely integrated. Give it some hours of aeration and it pulls together nicely, or cellar it until 2018."
LXV,Syrah,87.0,65.0,1,"The winery lays claim to the first planting of Grenache Blanc in Oregon, and has established a track record for consistent quality. Here is a rich, ripe and generously fruity white wine, substantial enough to pair well even with your creamiest sauces. Fleshy pear, apricot and tropical fruits are set against juicy acidity. This is a winner!"
LXV,Viognier,86.5,35.0,2,"A thick, rich and balanced expression of great, estate-owned dirt, this wine has well-developed elements of green apple, pear and lemon, with teases of wet stone and gravelly minerality."
La Chertosa,Chardonnay,91.0,25.0,1,"This is a rich, barrel fermented style that delivers creamy, layered, textured flavors accented with flower, white pepper and mineral notes. A smack of butterscotch finishes it beautifully."
La Chertosa,Sangiovese,91.0,35.0,1,"Smells rich and decadent, with aromas of orange marmalade and honey, but still maintains refreshing touches of citrus and pineapple throughout. It's thick and rich in the mouth, and finishes long, with excellent balance. This can easily compete with Canadian ice wines."
La Chertosa,Zinfandel,86.0,29.0,1,"Inky and dense, with plum-cake aromas along with nuances of tree bark and nutmeg. The more time you give this ripe, tannic red, the more it'll offer. The fruit is pure and ripe, and the tannins are anything but meek. On the finish, root beer, chocolate and vanilla notes add some complexity and sweetness. The fruit is 61% Columbia Valley (Wash.) and 39% southern Oregon, and the whole is a fine yet brawny offering."
La Clarine Farm,Mourvèdre,93.67,23.33,3,"Tart to the point of being flat-out sour, this might appeal to lovers of rhubarb pie. Rhubarb and sour plum flavors are matched with sharp acidity. The fruit seems underripe."
La Clarine Farm,Red Blend,88.5,21.0,2,"There is very little to distinguish any of the 2010 Maryhill Cabernets from each other. This shows a dash of cassis, with a big streak of vanilla and just a hint of orange peel."
La Clarine Farm,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.5,23.0,2,"A rich, earthy blend of half Barbera, half Zinfandel that tastes light at first, earthy with raspberry and cherry tones. On the finish, it gets darker, its spicy, dark fruit tones memorably bound in a wall of leather and tobacco."
La Clarine Farm,Rosé,89.0,16.0,1,"A miracle for Grateful Dead fans who have matured into wine, there's lots to like in this red blend that's got bright, friendly cherry fruit, a lick of spice and surprising sophistication. It's medium in weight, with a shock of silky berry fruit on the finish. The blend is 60% Zinfandel, 23% Petite Sirah, 11% Barbera and 6% Sangiovese. Pair it with mushroom pizza or burgers. Jerry would approve."
La Clarine Farm,Syrah,91.25,24.75,4,"Round and fruity, with a generous mix of berry and cherry, and no discernible oak influence, this pleasing Mourvèdre lets the fruit be the star. Nicely balanced and drinking well already, it carries a hint of mineral/metal in the finish."
La Clarine Farm,White Blend,83.0,20.0,1,"A dark, brooding showcase of many of Shake Ridge Vineyards's finest varieties mixed into one inviting bottle. With 31% Syrah, 28% Primitivo, 18% Petite Sirah, 10% Mourvèdre, 7% Malbec and 6% Merlot, this wine has baked plum and dark bright cherry predominantly, followed by a grip of tobacco and cinnamon spice. Have it with roasted meat and potatoes."
La Crema,Chardonnay,90.5,42.5,2,"Light and balanced, this five grape Bordeaux-style blend does not try to overreach. The fruit is clean and delicate, pale cherry set amidst dried leaves, tobacco, and muted tannins. Plenty of acid keeps it lively, but everything is in focus and proportionate."
La Crema,Pinot Noir,90.67,48.33,3,"Grown in Santa Barbara County pioneer Rick Longoria's estate vineyard, this grabs attention with tobacco smoke and funky earth aromas. On the palate, the savory smells switch to bright acidity, with cranberry and barely ripe raspberry taking hold and evolving into a lasting finish. Stunning now, but it will emerge through 2019."
La Diligence,Syrah,91.0,48.0,1,"Winemaker Michael McCay considers this white a field blend, listing Vermentino, Verdelho, Muscat and an improbable dollop of Pinot Noir as the varieties. Together they equate to deliciousness, a light, stainless-fermented statement of pineapple and guava, the Vermentino's salty head rearing just slightly."
La Fenêtre,Chardonnay,89.0,36.0,1,"Borra demonstrates its mastery with whites in this interesting, perfect mélange of sweetness and zip. Made in a dry style, the sweetness is mostly in the aromatics, which imply peach-colored roses, and inviting mouthfeel, which imparts subtle grapefruit and stone fruit amidst all the crispness."
La Fenêtre,Pinot Noir,92.33,43.33,3,"From a 2,500-foot elevation site, this Cab Franc is intriguingly peppery, light in oak and resplendent in raspberry liqueur aromas and a trace of pine forest. Moderate in tannins and silky in texture it's ready to be enjoyed now with cheese and charcuterie."
La Folia Winery,Red Blend,89.0,40.0,1,"Fragrant and inviting in dark cherry, raspberry and cola spice, this medium-weight Pinot Noir is lush and meaty. Bright flavors veer from dark cherry to raspberry, with a pronounced lift of earth and herb. The wine is layered, beautifully textured and long in the finish."
La Follette,Chardonnay,91.33,40.83,6,"Classic varietal smells of chalk and golden raisin emerge from this wine. It's lusciously smooth once sipped, with orange, limestone and vanilla pudding leaning up against bitter greens and just-ripe nectarine. Serve with beets and goat cheese or Chinese chicken salad."
La Follette,Pinot Noir,91.57,42.0,7,"This wine hails from an estate that dates back to 1978, but was more recently purchased by San Luis Obispo developer Rob Rossi and Raytheon CEO Bill Swanson. They assembled a “dream team” of grower Kevin Wilkinson (of Talley Vineyards and Coastal Vineyard Services) and winemakers Mike Sinor and Nathan Carlson. The wine boasts a lifting nose of cream, hazelnut and baked apples, then dances across the palate with lemon-zest and flint flavors."
La Honda Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,40.0,2,"This explodes aromatically with honey and apricot and is balanced and silky on the palate, with 13.9% residual sugar. Somewhere midway through and on the finish, a hint of jalapeño provides a stark segue, before an appearance of pear and honey saves the day."
La Honda Winery,Pinot Noir,90.5,28.0,2,"Lemony and high-strung, this is a light, bright and low-in-oak wine from an appellation better known for varieties like Zinfandel and Sauvignon Blanc. It works though, providing a tension of acidity with citrusy concentration."
La Honda Winery,Red Blend,88.0,26.0,2,"Hinting at oak and steeped in ripe fig, this is a hearty white wine with an herbal edge, fermented in stainless steel and then aged in neutral oak. From prime spots within Dutton Ranch, it provides a layering of tropical pineapple and melon within a suggestion of lemon, finishing dry."
La Jota Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,95.0,85.0,1,"This is a 100% Cabernet Sauvignon that's shy on the nose and softly approachable on the palate. Herbal and dry, it is couched in solidly built tannin and weight, with leathery graphite and cedar pronouncing themselves around a full body."
La Marea,Grenache,93.0,38.0,2,"An orangey hue of pink, this wine by Wes Hagen and family gives off aromas of peach brulée, watermelon and yeast. It's more textual than flavorful on the palate, with hints of red apple laced into a very acidic structure."
La Montagne,Chardonnay,91.0,42.0,1,"This majority-Syrah was fermented with a tiny handful of Viognier, both grown on a certified-organic estate vineyard. With a touch of licorice and leather in the mix, it offers funk that may or may not be of interest to every palate and should be enjoyed sooner rather than later."
La Montagne,Pinot Noir,90.4,53.2,5,"A dense, tannic and concentrated Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, this conveys boysenberry and anise among the thick walls of structure and intensity that give this wine full-bodied flavor. Let it open and enjoy with hearty fare."
La Pitchoune,Chardonnay,90.0,78.0,2,"A forest-like earthiness mingles with yeasty baked bread aromas in this soft, well-built Mourvèdre- and Petite Sirah-dominant field blend. Fig, black pepper and tar flavors show through a tightly knit foundation of powerful tannin and texture, seasoned with Asian spice."
La Pitchoune,Pinot Noir,89.0,45.5,4,"This blend of four red-Bordeaux varieties opens with fresh cassis notes that lead to a juicier core. Structured and robust yet accessible, it features chocolate and blackberry jam flavors."
La Rusticana d'Orsa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,50.0,1,"This extended skin contact experiment from winemaker Ed Kurtzman was a success, its chamomile, lime and meringue-like scents framed by chalky minerality on the nose. The palate is tightly wound with saffron, lemon peel and grapefruit touches upheld by a persistent acidity that seemingly crescendoes on the finish."
La Sirena,Muscat Canelli,91.0,30.0,1,"This viscous wine offers an underlay of toasty oak notes that round out its gravelly texture. Light-bodied and filigreed with acidity, its lemon, quince and fig flavors remain fresh and vibrant on the palate."
La Sirena,Red Blend,90.0,65.0,1,"This wine is sourced from a unique block in the heart of the appellation and the producer's 165-acre estate, rich in sedimentary rock fragments of quartz and fossils. It's lush and soft on the palate, with leather, ripe red berry and cassis flavors. The tannins are strong and wrapped tenaciously around the fruit, requiring further time in bottle; drink 2020–2028."
La Storia,Merlot,83.0,34.0,1,"This is a blend from several vineyard sites, including Banfield, Saitone, Carlisle, Montafi and Papera, each boasting more than 100-year-old vines. A chocolate cordial note dominates the palate, as bold cherry, rhubarb, cinnamon and citrus flavors wander in. It's a steal for the price, too."
La Storia,Red Blend,86.0,36.0,1,"So rich it's almost fat, this unctuous Gewürztraminer mingles massive floral rose petal flavors with a lightly soapy, caramel core. The fruit is soft and round and mixes up a wide variety of tropical flavors, mixed in with the oily, floral flavors of the grape. Creamy and lush, it's like a vendange tardive only dry."
La Voix,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,65.0,1,"This is a thin, hard and tight version of the estate wine. It shows a bit more depth, but it's compact and slow to unravel. The oak is delivering butterscotch and vanilla, laid on as a buttery finish. This is too young to drink right now."
La Voix,Chardonnay,93.0,55.0,1,"This is finished dry, at 13.3% alcohol, and puts the emphasis on citrus and grass, cracker and grain. There is a smidgeon of varietal perfume—a whiff of rose petal—but overall it's trending more toward Sauvignon Blanc than most Gewürztraminer. Nonetheless there is an impression of sweetness on the palate, from the nicely-ripened fruit."
La Voix,Pinot Noir,92.67,50.0,3,"A new addition to the popular Indian Wells line, this consists of 60% Merlot, 28% Syrah and splashes of five other grapes. The Merlot, not surprisingly, dominates. Pretty and round, it has a soft, almost pillowy texture, with an easy, accessible mouthfeel."
La Voix,Syrah,93.0,40.0,1,"A fine, vivid, crystal-clear Pinot Gris, this offers cool cucumber and melon flavors first and foremost. It's a refreshing addition to the white wine lineup at H3."
LaVelle,Pinot Noir,85.0,38.0,1,"A fine bottle at a great price, this fresh and clean-tasting Sauvignon Blanc offers a bracing mix of tree fruit, with just a touch of sweet herb. It's clearly varietal: no frills, just straightforward and very nicely made."
LaVelle,Riesling,91.0,15.0,1,"Opening with a mouthful of dusty raspberry and cherry flavors, this Bordeaux blend of a little more than half Cabernet Sauvignon and smaller percentages of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot offers much in the way of inviting fruit and spice notes. Its pleasing acidity lasts through the finish."
Labyrinth,Pinot Noir,91.0,52.0,1,"Another Fenestra-Silvaspoons collaboration, Tourvanillo is a proprietary blend of Iberian grapes, predominantly Touriga, and is marked mostly by its aromatic highlights of spicy cinnamon and vibrant currant. Dense, it is interesting and intense with rounded edges and a leathery, long finish."
Lachini,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.25,49.5,4,"A compelling Port-like wine made from Petite Sirah, ZInfandel and Syrah grapes aged more than 10 years to form this mix of almonds and sweet apple pie laced with caramel, smooth and easy to drink and pleasant in its Armagnac-like aromas. The almonds come back, laced in maple syrup, on the finish."
Lachini,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.33,49.0,6,"Made with 100% Grenache, this is fermented in neutral oak before being transferred to tank. It has substantial weight and spiced cherry flavor. Full bodied for a rosé, it can stand up to a variety of cured meats, pasta dishes and even salmon."
Lachini,Chardonnay,90.5,51.25,4,"Named for winemaker Virginie Bourgue, this entirely stainless-fermented Sauvignon Blanc has a grassy, spicy edge reminiscent of Loire Valley whites. It's also tongue-twistingly tart, a reflection of the vintage, like a lemon explosion in the mouth. In other words, this is a perfect seafood wine."
Lachini,Muscat Canelli,94.0,36.0,1,"A well-made, earthy Carignane, this tastes of cinnamon and plum cobbler, with subtle layers of bacon and smoke on the finish. Full-bodied, but also softly round, this is just right for hearty dishes like braised lamb or roasted pork."
Lachini,Pinot Noir,90.24,51.14,21,"A quite remarkable mauve-pink in color, this offers faint cherry aromas. It's nearly sweet on the palate, with strawberries and hard red berry candy flavors."
Lachini,Red Blend,91.0,45.0,1,"This wine is well made in the lightly sweet but full-bodied style. It has plenty of ripe fruit flavors, high alcohol and moderate tannins to add texture."
Ladera,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,60.0,1,"A rose garden's worth of aromas lift out of the glass in this hearty, full-bodied red, the peppery tannins somewhat grippy on the palate before settling down. Blackberry punches through on the palate, given additional color and lift from the 5% Petit Verdot."
Lady Hill,Pinot Noir,86.0,28.0,1,"This untamed, boisterous wine has aromas like herbs and cola leading to powerful grapy, berrylike flavors and an assertive, grainy texture."
Laelaps,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,44.0,1,"Very ripe in aroma, almost thick in texture and syrupy in flavor, this wine is full bodied, super fruity and smooth."
Laelaps,Pinot Noir,90.25,33.0,4,"A Grenache-based Rhône blend, C'est Si Bon is good and very subtle. Like a Beaujolais, an earthy leather note emerges in between soft violet and raspberry tones. With a line of acidity, it's a fine wine for food."
Laetitia,Chardonnay,87.5,17.5,2,"Elegant and well structured, this offers vibrant strawberry fruit wrapped around inviting aromatics of violet and spice. This cool-climate Pinot boasts a silky texture on the palate and finishes with subtle suggestions of wood smoke and cinnamon."
Laetitia,Pinot Noir,92.29,48.36,14,"Long-time admirers of this wine may find the 2011 version a bit thin. It's a more subtle wine than is customary, the expressive funk subsumed below lighter layers of peat moss, sea salt and white chocolate. With decanting, scents of shittake mushroom, duck sauce and even chicken broth swirl up from the glass, with black tea flavors running through the tannins. Quite good, yet somewhat muted."
Laetitia,Sparkling Blend,89.67,30.44,9,"Just the second vintage for this Cab/Syrah blend, it sets its umami-soaked fruit in a crusty, toasty framework. Adding a splash (here 10%) of Syrah was once known in Bordeaux as to “Hermitager” the wine, bringing color and spice into the mix. This relatively soft Cabernet shows highlights of orange peel, apricot, pepper and cured meat."
Lafond,Chardonnay,90.88,33.38,8,"Overlooking the Gualala River and Pacific Ocean, the McDougall Vineyard reaches elevations of 1,100 feet, a perfect vantage point from which to breathe in fresh, cooling coastal air. The resulting wine is awash in bright, vibrant acidity, yet offers equal measures of juicy black cherry fruit and dried herb spice."
Lafond,Pinot Noir,91.0,37.2,5,"Opening with a rich, luxurious nose, this wine is delightfully bright on the palate before evolving into brooding notes of black cherry and smoky oak. Hints of dark chocolate and coconut shavings round out the intrigue and complexity. The wine is ready to enjoy now, but worth cellaring through 2020."
Lafond,Riesling,91.0,32.0,2,"Deeply intriguing and funky aromas of sweet tar, charred blueberries and hot rubber emerge from this study of using minimal amounts of new oak on a typically oak-aged variety. Some may find the reductive nose challenging, but the palate is more approachable, with dark chocolate and cassis flavors."
Lafond,Syrah,90.75,32.75,4,"Prevalent black pepper scents swirl alluringly with leather, air-dried meats, tea and blackberry fruit on the nose. It's light, vibrant and peppery on the palate as well, making it a refreshing wine that also delivers a hefty, satisfying flavor profile."
Lafond,Syrah-Grenache,91.0,38.0,1,"Bow Tie is planted to a variety of clones, including Swan and Rochioli. It is one of the winery's newest vineyard sources and this vintage is the first of its vineyard-designated wines from the site. Floral in anise, plum and raspberry, it is medium-bodied with a background of oak that picks up on the finish, offering seasonings of caramel and chocolate."
Lagana,Pinot Noir,87.0,37.5,4,"Winemaker Scott Hawley delivers deep and dark aromas of blueberry and mint against a backdrop of bacon fat and barrel smoke. The mouthfeel is rich and lush, with more blueberry plus anise, black licorice and a canvas of minty herbs that also reveal a touch of bitterness."
Lagana,Riesling,87.0,16.0,1,"Bradley Brown's Syrah magic shines again on this wine from a vineyard planted 2,300 feet over the eastside of the Salinas Valley. The wine is redolent on the nose, with black pepper, crushed violet and salted pork. It pulls a tannic punch to the mouth once sipped, with blackberry, leather, heavy-duty tar and persistent pepper. Decant for maximum flavor extraction."
Lagana,Sauvignon Blanc,84.0,18.0,1,"All the Brick House wines are certified organic and Biodynamic. Les Dijonnais spent 15 months in 30% new French oak. The opening aromas lead with fresh, lively, buoyant notes of cherry fruit. With more exposure to air its tannins get a bit chewy, and the wine shows impressive strength through a long finish."
Lagana,Syrah,86.67,30.0,3,"Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose. Once sipped, a rainbow of dark flavors emerges: chopped Italian herbs, creosote, black olive, fennel, soy and orange pith, reminiscent of a North African tagine."
Laird,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.75,83.75,4,"This is a curious but successful blend of basically equal parts Zinfandel, Malbec and Tannat. Rich aromas of blackberry and blueberry meet with pine, cigar box and wet rocks on the nose. The berry fruit that shows first on the sip is elevated by a woody backbone and lifted with crushed clove."
Laird,Pinot Noir,87.0,55.0,1,"This winery is adept at crafting unusual blends. In this case, 55% Syrah, 40% Zinfandel and 5% Viognier join forces to offer elderberry, blackberry, pine oil, toasted oak, crushed black pepper and charred meat on the nose. The palate gives chocolate, allspice, baked cherry and blueberry, vanilla and a toasty cedar tone."
Laird,Red Blend,86.0,46.67,3,"Dense blueberry and black-cherry aromas mix with black pepper, lavender and violets on the nose of this blend of 62% Primitivo, 29% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre. The palate is a bit reserved, but offers blackberry, pepper, dried fennel, bay leaf and thyme flavors."
Lake Chelan,Red Blend,86.0,45.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon (65%) takes the lead in this wine, followed by Merlot (29%), Malbec (3%) and Cabernet Franc (3%). Aromas of cocoa, vanilla, graphite, and red and black fruit are followed by palate-coating fruit and barrel flavors backed by firm but well-integrated tannins."
Lake Chelan,Riesling,83.5,17.5,2,"From a 30-year-old vineyard planted to historic cuttings of the grape, this wine has an inviting nose that shows fresh strawberry-hibiscus juice mixed with marjoram, mint and light cedar. The palate packs in all that's wondrous about Cab Franc, highlighting oregano, thyme, bay leaf, leather and peppercorn against a backdrop of boysenberry and elderberry fruit."
Lake Chelan,Syrah,85.5,31.5,2,"There's an impressive freshness to this seven-year-old bottling, with both just-picked and baked blackberry aromas alongside pressed violets and dried ginger on the lavish nose. Vibrant olallieberries show on the sip, with violet-flavored cake adding to this study of purple flavors."
Lake Chelan,White Blend,84.0,18.0,1,"This interesting blend pairs 66% Zinfandel from head-trained old vines with 34% Grenache to offer a wine that, though six years old, manages to maintain a youthful freshness. Aromas of pomegranate, underripe strawberry, raspberry and candied rose petals lead into a juicy palate of hibiscus and rose hips. The marjoram spice and slate minerality keep it serious."
Lake Sonoma,Zinfandel,91.0,17.0,1,"This blend of 26% Viognier, 25% Grenache Blanc, 25% Marsanne and 24% Roussanne manages to be both lush and light, showing candied melon, clover honey, pretty green pear and lime-butter on the nose. The palate offers Gala apples and fresh lemon zest, yet retains and intriguingly savory quality throughout the sip."
Lamborn Family Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,100.0,2,"Impressively delicate but also generous in aromas, this bottling shows lemon curd, caramelized apple and a touch of baby powder on the nose. There's a sharp line of salty acidity on the palate, with flavors of candied apple and Meyer lemon."
Lamoreaux Landing,Chardonnay,86.5,18.25,4,"Aromas of herb, granite, pomegranate and brooding dark fruit leads to a full-flavored palate, bursting with red fruit and savory accents. The tannins provide some heft but should settle in nicely with additional time in the bottle."
Lamoreaux Landing,Gewürztraminer,87.0,15.0,1,"This is a dark, black and brooding wine, full bodied and firmly impacted in tannin. Mountain sage, currant and mocha highlight dense ripe fruit and dustiness that linger with a spiciness of clove on the finish."
Lamoreaux Landing,Riesling,84.0,30.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (38%), Cabernet Franc (33%), Merlot (20%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of earth, herb, flowers and red and black fruit are followed by well-proportioned dark-fruit flavors that show a lot of structure. It's a great introduction to the house style."
Lamoreaux Landing,Vidal Blanc,87.0,24.0,1,"This wine shows a full-bodied wealth of cassis and black currant within a bold, brooding body. Mild in texture, it allows for robust notes of toasted oak and coffee to form additional complexity."
Lamoreaux Landing,White Blend,85.0,15.0,1,"This wine succeeds in showing ripe, robust and even slightly rustic fruit flavor within a complex, integrated mix of tannin and oak. Dried cherry, chocolate and nutmeg accent a succulent backbone of juicy acidity and likable texture. The vines are 60-plus-years old."
Lampyridae,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,100.0,1,"A very pretty pale-copper color with a tinge of pink, this wine offers delicate, nuanced aromas of orange peel and mineral. The palate has a lightly creamy feel, showing a lot of freshness and tension."
Lancaster,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.6,74.8,5,"This wine is principally Cabernet Sauvignon (52%), Merlot (35%), along with dollops of Petit Verdot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère. The aromas show complexity, with notes of herb, pink peppercorn, dark fruit, coffee and wood spice. The flavors are supple and layered, with bright acidity and firm tannins providing the frame."
Lancaster,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,75.0,1,"The light and fruity flavors of young vines dominate here, tart and sharp in this cool vintage. Raspberry and light herb open into a delicate, short, somewhat attenuated wine."
Lancaster,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,30.0,3,"Very tart, with barely ripe flavors of rhubarb and wild raspberries, this late release is already showing bricking around the rim. It's high in acid but low in fruit flavor, and from the looks of it, should be consumed immediately."
Landmark,Chardonnay,90.23,38.31,13,"Grapes come from Alexander, Dry Creek and Russian River valleys to make this wine, first released in 1997. Oaky and mild-mannered on the palate, it shows touches of clove, black pepper and dried herb, while robust tannins play a supporting role."
Landmark,Pinot Noir,90.36,46.82,11,This medium-bodied wine has modest fruit and herb aromas and similarly subdued flavors. It is clean and straightforward.
Lang & Reed,Cabernet Franc,90.5,48.0,2,"This Rhône-style blend of 60% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre is soft and smooth. The fruity, forward palate shows little influence for having aged for 21 months in barrel, and so the flavors tend to be simple. Notes of red berries, red licorice and a dash of cayenne are all found."
Lange,Chardonnay,92.11,49.56,9,The Cabernet Franc matches well with the Merlot in this blend. Dark fruits and polished tannins elevate this well-defined wine. It has no frills but plenty of flavor.
Lange,Pinot Gris,91.17,25.33,6,"This is just a bit on the sweet side, but there is plenty of acidity to be found. It's fruity, peachy, succulent and fresh."
Lange,Pinot Noir,89.8,50.95,20,"The Magnifique is a barrel selection from the French oak-aged side of the winery. It's 100% Syrah and packed with blackberry, black cherry and streaks of citrus. It's very well balanced, complete and firm; the wine should age nicely for another decade at least."
LangeTwins,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.5,30.0,2,"With full ripeness, density and concentration, this keeps its superb balance at just 10.8% alcohol and 5% residual sugar. The dynamic tension plays out beautifully, and doesn't veer into any sort of sugary slackness. This has the sort of weight and complexity you would expect in a $30 wine."
LangeTwins,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.5,18.75,4,"This wine carries a whiff of honeyed fig, which opens out into a luscious, rich, satisfying, full-bodied Sémillon. It's a complete wine, which seems to run through a lifetime's evolution in the mouth, finishing with a creamy, plush mix of fruit and barrel. Long, seamless and delicious."
LangeTwins,Chardonnay,85.83,17.5,6,"Because he blends shortly after fermentation, Matt Loso's wines attain a seamless complexity early on; it's a hallmark of the winery. This beautifully crafted Claret has no rough edges; in fact, no edges at all. It is a supple, elegant wine, loaded with fruit flavors that run from berry to cherry to plum, while the oak gently adds spice and toast."
LangeTwins,Chenin Blanc,86.0,20.0,1,"This is top drawer—elegant, detailed and richly varietal. The fruit is tart and tangy but not sour or thin. Mixed green fruits, apple, citrus, and a lightly toasty nose set up a wine with impressive length. The midpalate richness includes ripe melon, butterscotch and cinnamon spice. It's all barrel-fermented in neutral oak. This is a real strength of the brand."
LangeTwins,Gewürztraminer,90.0,20.0,2,"This tastes like fruit from a cooler, perhaps higher altitude site. It's got a bracing minerality that runs through the fruit and gives the wine a solid backbone. Rhubarb and cranberry fruit is tightly laced against that rocky core, with plenty of natural acid propping up the finish. Little oak flavor is evident right now, though 38% of the barrels were new. This wine should be decanted, but as it opens it really shines."
LangeTwins,Malbec,80.0,15.0,1,"A fine value in Oregon Pinot Noir, the estate bottling from Apolloni brings typical varietal flavors of sassafras, cherry cola and fresh herb. The fruit is perfectly ripe, yet retains the peppery, herbal, leafy character of northern Willamette Valley sites. Barrel aging adds length, texture and a finishing splash of butterfat."
LangeTwins,Merlot,82.0,30.0,1,"This is winemaker Rich Cushman's estate vineyard. At 25 years of age, it may well be the oldest Riesling planting in the region. The alcohol is just under 11%, but there is plenty of acid under the fruit, so despite its off-dry designation, this is a wine that would work wonderfully well with a wide variety of cheeses and appetizers. Flavors suggest pears and peaches, detailed with spice and stone."
LangeTwins,Moscato,87.0,16.0,1,"This is the first Grüner fruit from Underwood Mountain, and it promises good—maybe great—things to come. Sleek and stony, the wine epitomizes the racy, slightly grassy, slightly peppery quality of classic Austrian Grüner, with a Pacific Northwest twist—a certain brilliant intensity to the fruit that reflects this northern latitude. Clearly the best Grüner from Oregon or Washington to date."
LangeTwins,Nero d'Avola,88.0,20.0,1,"Searingly tart, this might be a 2007 Muscadet for its thrilling, stiletto-steel spine and leesy minerality. Simply calling it unoaked does not begin to do justice to the complexity and textural density that this unusual Oregon Chardonnay offers. For acid lovers who don't think that Chardonnay must be slathered in toasty new wood in order to have any flavor, this wine will be a joy."
LangeTwins,Red Blend,86.0,23.0,2,"This Oak Ridge bottling is rich and unctuous. Scents and flavors of rose petals mingle with a lightly soapy, oily, broad midpalate that floats along on a bed of flowers, stone fruits, toast, hazelnuts, caramel and stone. A splash of everything, but it comes together in a seductive, open framework with just enough acid to support it."
LangeTwins,Sangiovese,85.0,15.0,1,"This proprietary blend combines 52% Cabernet Franc, 34% Merlot and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, another in its line of Aaron Pott-made wines. It's lovable in its austerity and varietal suggestions of dried herb, cedar and green bean. Dusty, soft tannins support a full-bodied, straightforward structure."
LangeTwins,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,15.0,1,"Rich in body but light in tannins, this warm, generous wine fills the mouth and eases down the throat. It has a good mélange of cherry, strawberry and floral aromas, satisfying fruit flavors and a nicely soft finish."
LangeTwins,Viognier,84.0,16.0,1,"This is a fruity, dry rosé comprised of a blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. A light salmon pink color, it's forward and plush with generous fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, peaches and strawberries. Full-bodied for a rosé, it has the stuffing to accompany a main course such as roast fowl."
LangeTwins,Zinfandel,89.0,60.0,1,"Tannat is a rarity anywhere in the USA, but especially in Oregon. Yet it does well at this southern location, producing a full-bodied and forward wine with a potent flavor mix of black fruit and leather, cedar and espresso. The highlights of smoke and charred wood are unrestrained, yet work well with the ample fruit packed into the core. This wine begs for a charcoal-grilled steak."
Lapis Luna,Cabernet Sauvignon,81.0,15.0,1,"Ripe and creamy, this reserve cuvée is 100% varietal. It mixes plump melon and peach fruit with supple acids. There is no indication of having gone through malolactic, but the finish brings a suggestion of ghee. Try putting this in the fridge for about 15 minutes before opening."
Lapis Luna,Zinfandel,82.0,15.0,1,"This wine has a deep-gold color and aromas like apricots and toasted almonds. Flavors are almost as ripe as pineapple, while a creamy texture helps the fruit complexity linger on the finish."
Larner,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,36.0,1,"A big wine for Merlot, this high alcohol (14.6%) effort ramps up its black cherry fruit with volatile acidity and brings in chocolaty barrel flavors under an earthy, tannic finish. Another year or two in the bottle can only help; at this young age it seems a little blowsy and sharp."
Larner,Syrah,92.67,55.0,3,"Perhaps the most forward and appealing wine in the lineup, the Vista Hills Pinot Noir brings round flavors of chocolate-covered cherries, hints at pepper and herb, then finished up with lots more chocolate. Though not as detailed as some of the other Panther Creek single-vineyard offerings, it has pleasure written all over it."
Las Positas,Barbera,89.75,45.0,4,"Cherries jump out at you, a dense compendium of fruit set against iron and earth. The wine is a bit austere, tight; it may need decanting. But it's got good concentration and spice, and flavor that keeps on running through a long finish."
Las Positas,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,61.75,4,"This wine has a zesty, effervescent aspect that provides a sense of refreshment, built around subdued oak and ripe lemon and lime. Medium in weight and dry, it finishes with a flair of salty brine, like an olive martini."
Las Positas,Chardonnay,86.0,38.0,1,"There's a stewy rustiness to this wine on the entry, an evocative recall of the old country, when grandfather made wine in his basement. From a high-elevation vineyard site, it takes time to open. Once it does, the full-bodied expression of juicy blackberry and leather combine to nice effect."
Las Positas,Malbec,89.0,50.0,1,"This is a breadwinner bottling for the otherwise high-end, single-vineyard specialists from Los Gatos. It's a solid deal, offering a tight, slightly sour nose of cranberry juice, graphite and violets. The palate clings to juicy cherries with a sage-like twist."
Las Positas,Petite Sirah,86.0,35.5,2,"This reserve-level wine is annotated with interesting highlights of iron, mint and tea leaf, all wrapped around a black-cherry core. There's a streak of cola running through it all, and just a hint of alcohol burn in the finish."
Las Positas,Pinot Blanc,85.0,28.0,2,"Aromas of beeswax and lemon oil, the flavors following along with tangerine, orange and peach. Very dry, with exceptional concentration of fruit, and well-integrated flavors of cracker and grain. This was barrel fermented, and delivers a long, concentrated finish."
Las Positas,Pinot Grigio,86.0,28.0,1,"The Cowgirl Cab, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is DaMa's most popular offering. Loaded with bright, brambly berry fruits, licorice and loam, it's notable also for smooth, silky tannins."
Las Positas,Pinot Gris,85.0,28.0,1,"From Klipsun and Hedges fruit, this muscular, aromatic Merlot begins with pretty berry scents, then develops flavors of currant and cherry. It's a wine with meat and muscle, still packed tight, but dense with potential. Give it plenty of decanting, or cellar it for five years."
Las Positas,Red Blend,91.0,40.67,3,"This is a Merlot-dominated Bordeaux blend. Along with pleasant, strawberry fruit you'll find scents of candied roses and hints of fresh herb. The length and detail bespeak a wine with medium-term aging potential. Baking spices dominate the finish, with a burst of heat from the near-15% alcohol."
Las Positas,Rosé,87.0,27.5,2,"Hogue's Genesis bottling is far more limited than the winery's other Rieslings, and offers extra dimensions in terms of concentration and grip. Though just 12.6% alcohol, it tastes dry enough, with juicy acidity and green apple flavors. What elevates it above the less expensive bottling is its length, the minerality and the hints of white flower, Mandarin orange and stone."
Las Positas,Syrah,87.0,33.5,2,"The best Hogue Chardonnay in years, this 2007 reserve bottling showcases fully ripened apple, peach and melon fruit flavors in a luscious wrapping of new oak. Butterscotch and a whisp of vanilla carry through the seductive finish."
Las Positas,Tempranillo,87.0,39.0,2,"High in perceptible acidity, this wine leans savory in rhubarb, cranberry and a twist of sour cherry, adding in clove and black pepper behind the scenes. Light-bodied, it's soft and table-ready."
Las Positas,White Blend,86.5,32.5,4,"This is a smooth and elegant wine with a robust backbone of dark berry and currant, espresso and tea that presents full-bodied ripeness and exuberance on the palate. Minty vanilla closes things out."
Lasseter,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.8,87.6,5,"Made from 62% Viognier and 38% Roussanne, grown at the proprietor's Stagecoach Vineyard, this is a richly concentrated white, viscous in honey and graham cracker and a full-bodied encasing. Barrel-fermented in 32% new French oak, as well as stainless steel and neutral wood, it's a big expression of baked peach and vanilla."
Lasseter,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,56.0,1,"Strawberry hulls, earth and a touch of bittersweet black tea combine in this full-bodied, expressive wine with a slight, reductive quality and spicy acidity. From a spot on the Santa Rosa Plain, it comes from a mix of clones and is soft on the palate."
Lasseter,Rosé,87.0,28.0,2,"Merlot makes up three quarters of this wine with the rest Cabernets Franc (17%) and Sauvignon. The Franc shows itself, with aromas of lightly leafy herbs that are followed by tire rubber, anise, vanilla and cherry. The cranberry and cherry flavors are sweet, with rustic tannins backing them up."
Lasseter,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,87.5,46.0,2,"Quite reserved in aromas at first, this starts to show bruised lemon skins, ripe stonefruit and a touch of cream on the nose. A preserved lemon element and sour orange character mark the nose, with touches of marzipan yet lacking the usually associated creaminess."
Lasseter,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,46.0,1,"Coming in at a strikingly low alcohol for the vintage, the fruit in this blend doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with strong aromas of freshly sliced jalapeño along with leafy herbs. The flavors are tart and elegant, broadening on the finish."
Lasseter,Zinfandel,90.0,48.0,1,"Sweet vanilla oak gives this full-bodied, tropical wine its signature, a luscious taste of fruit-forward approachability that risks becoming overdone. From Vine Hill Ridge Vineyard in the heart of the appellation, it exhibits the power and warmth of the vintage."
Last Light,Chardonnay,88.0,28.0,2,"Minty sage and cedar dot the aromatic profile of this wine that is holding on to tannin and oak with a fierce stubbornness. Tart cherry, pomegranate and blueberry give it a fruity mélange, accented by subtle rose petal and violet."
Last Light,Pinot Noir,92.0,34.0,3,"The aromas on this wine from the Carmel Valley-based producer are relatively light, with hints of honeysuckle, white lily and peach blossom. The palate is quite tart and crisp, with flavors of lime skin and grapefruit pith."
Latah Creek,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,20.0,1,"A bright pinkish-orange color makes this light-bodied wine stand out from the beginning, Fresh watermelon and cherry flavors carry on the rounded palate, with a slight sweetness giving softness."
Latah Creek,Chardonnay,85.0,12.0,1,"This Bordeaux-style blend is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with small percentages of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Merlot. It's high-toned, and it comes with a pungency that brightens the highly extracted, sweet-tasting berry fruit. It has lots of appeal, but you must like wines that have a volatile edge."
Latah Creek,Malbec,85.0,16.0,1,"Bone dry and hinting at a sweet herb flavor, this wine backs away from the fruitiness found in most domestic Chenin Blanc. It offers complex details of yellow fruit, lemon verbena and beeswax."
Latah Creek,Merlot,83.0,16.0,1,"Intensely aromatic, with lovely accents of pine needle, grapefruit and mint. An elegant, complex and vividly spicy wine, with all elements proportionate, and showing excellent depth and structure. The flavors of fruit and forest just keep unfolding through a lingering finish."
Latah Creek,Moscato,88.0,15.0,2,"Sleek and sappy, this was fermented with native yeast and aged nine months in 50% new French oak. There's a spine of iron keeping it a bit stiff and compact, with concentrated fruit flavors of crème de cassis. Still young and slightly grapey, it's best to cellar it a few more years, for a drinking window of 2020 to 2030."
Latah Creek,Muscat Canelli,86.5,11.0,2,"All biodynamically raised estate fruit comprises this marvelous Viognier, which spent four months in 40% new French oak. The full-bodied, perfect ripeness mixes apple, pear and apricot, with a gentle kiss of caramel from the short-term barrel aging. The length and balance set the standard for top-flight domestic Viognier."
Latah Creek,Petite Sirah,87.67,30.0,3,"This most appealing Chardonnay offers a deluxe display of Meyer lemon, baked pear and toasted marshmallow flavors in a ripe and creamy style. That lush core is focused and framed with ample acidity, and suggests a decade (at least) of life ahead. Drink now through 2026."
Latah Creek,Pinot Gris,86.0,11.0,1,"Seductive ripe, oaky and almost sweet flavors make this full-bodied wine easy to love. The plump blackberry and boysenberry flavors coat the palate while hints of nutmeg and vanilla spice up the aromas and continue through the finish. Concentration and a sense of layering close the deal."
Latah Creek,Primitivo,85.0,25.0,1,"Quite light in color, there is a red-cherry and strawberry base to the aroma of this bottling, which is laser-focused and redolent with scents of a morning hike through the chaparral, fresh with wild mint and sage. The palate starts round with strawberry, then tightens on cranberry and winds up on tart plum skins, all peppered with a grippy white sage spice and structure."
Latah Creek,Red Blend,83.0,20.0,1,"Extremely delicate on the nose, this wine from the historic vineyard shows bruised yellow grapefruit, sliced nectarine and crushed chalk aromas. The evolving palate starts daintily with cut apple and nectarine, then warms into seared peach, buttered popcorn and ripe pear flavors. A chalky, seashell-like structure and pithy texture ensure a long, interesting life. Drink 2018 through 2034."
Latah Creek,Riesling,87.0,13.0,1,"This calmly seductive wine has a deep, dark color, absolutely gorgeous fruit, wood smoke and baking spice aromas and a gentle texture that lets all the berry, black-cherry and pomegranate flavors soak into the taste buds. While quite full-bodied, it's easy on the tongue but does have an extra fine-grained wrapping of tannin to keep it firm. Best from 2020 through 2030."
Latah Creek,White Blend,85.0,10.0,1,"Balance, depth, detail and elegance are the hallmarks here. Pretty raspberry/cherry fruit comes up quickly, framed in proportionate acids and tannins. Streaks of malt powder, caramel and mocha weave through a long, subtle finish. Drink now through 2025."
Latah Creek,Zinfandel,87.0,25.0,1,"A nontraditional blend of 44% Zinfandel, 31% Syrah, 15% Merlot and 10% Petite Sirah, this bottling shows tight blueberry, milk chocolate, river rocks and rose petals on the dynamic nose. The palate is juicy with more blueberry and vanilla, but bound by a plum-skin tartness and a decently strong tannic grip."
Latta,Grenache,93.5,42.5,2,"A standout among the winery's single-vineyard selections, this big-boned effort brings flavors of chewy cherry alongside a citrus highlight and a definite underpinning of wet stone and clay. Texturally compelling, it should age gracefully through 2024."
Latta,Malbec,91.0,50.0,1,"This blend of 52% Syrah, 25% Grenache and 23% Mourvèdre is quite sultry on the nose, with crushed boysenberry, dried violets, wet clay and the slightest touch of soy. Pepper and moist earth arise on the palate, alongside blackberry and blueberry fruit, a touch of cocoa and concentrated lavender and other purple-flower flavors."
Latta,Roussanne,92.0,30.0,1,"Solid and full-bodied, almost blocky, this big-boned Chardonnay wraps its banana and light tropical fruit flavors in a generous layer of toasty oak. The acidity keeps it fresh, but it's a drink-soon style."
Laura Michael,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,52.0,1,"Toasty and tart, this lively wine is built upon wild-picked berry flavors. There is a streak of iron or metal running through the center of the palate; a flavor that some tasters will enjoy more than others."
Laura Michael,Zinfandel,89.5,40.0,2,"Light, smoky aromas and juicy, fruity flavors make this medium-bodied wine easy to enjoy. From a breezy delta vineyard, it's neither big nor overtly oaky but well-balanced and smooth in texture."
Laurel Glen,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.2,46.0,5,"Smoky toasty scents dominate this 50-50 blend of Tempranillo and Grenache. Firm purple fruits offer a taste of Spanish varietal character, with accents of bull's blood. This needs a bit more bottle age, which should continue to flesh out the finish."
Laurel Lake,Cabernet Sauvignon,82.0,18.0,1,"Nicely lean and not overly fruity, this medium-bodied wine has the typical firm tannins, leathery aromas and herbal flavors of the grape variety and makes a nice change of pace from the usual California menu of full-bodied, oaky concoctions."
Laurel Lake,Chardonnay,80.0,18.0,1,"Aromas are light, with notes of matchstick, herb and cherry. The cherry and plum flavors are sweet and generous, providing easy-drinking appeal."
Lauren Ashton Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.7,50.0,10,"This is a richer, rounder version of rosé, with tropical mango and pineapple notes as well as lush peach aspects. Moderate acidity keeps it grounded and refreshing."
Lauren Ashton Cellars,Bordeaux-style White Blend,88.0,27.0,1,"A deep shade of reddish pink, this rich style of rosé shows red cherry, cola, crushed slate and chalky, orange pith-like aromas on the nose. Ripe plum and strawberry flavors mark the palate, kissed by star anise and plenty of acidic bite."
Lauren Ashton Cellars,Chardonnay,92.0,38.0,1,"From estate-grown fruit dotted around the appellation, this wine shines in a fresh approach to tannin and savory-laced black cherry, seasoning it with clove, earth and black tea. Its length impresses, with the finish vibrantly spiked with cardamom and cola spice."
Lauren Ashton Cellars,G-S-M,91.0,50.0,1,"Very light in the glass, this bottling is also delicate on the nose in terms of power. But it offers tons of action nonetheless, with fresh and dried herbs, flint and a tiny bit of smoke adding to the red-fruit aromas. The palate is tense with energy, showing thyme, oregano and eucalyptus spice, placing more emphasis on the herbal backbone than the red-fruit ripeness."
Lauren Ashton Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.5,51.0,2,"Sourced from the Cedar Ranch vineyard in the Illinois Valley, this exquisite Riesling was entirely fermented with native yeast in both concrete egg and neutral wood. Given extended lees contact, it's textural and loaded with dry extract. Flavors highlight citrus rind, grapefruit and wet stone through the long and satisfying finish."
Lauren Ashton Cellars,Sangiovese,91.33,18.0,3,"This is the producer's inaugural offering of the variety, made in tiny amounts, but boy oh boy, it's good. Bright blue and black-berry succulence exude vibrancy and freshness on the palate complemented by savory hints of tar, black licorice and char. Velvety soft tannins allow the fruit to speak."
Lauren Ashton Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,91.5,27.5,2,"From a site on the edges of Santa Rosa, this vineyard-designate shows a wealth of baked strawberry and is noteworthy for its vibrantly fruity aromatics. Ripe, velvety and lush on the palate, it delivers sensually and deliciously, with a lasting imprint of cola spice on the finish."
Lava Cap,Barbera,88.0,23.33,3,"Being 100% varietal, the aromas of black currant, boysenberry, graphite and cherry are piercing and pure. The palate puts and emphasis on texture, showing layers of lightly jammy dark fruit flavors that pique the interest, with a long finish only upping the enjoyment."
Lava Cap,Cabernet Franc,90.0,28.0,1,"There's no question about the variety, with its jazzy aromas of raspberries, blackberries and graphite that lead to plump plush layered fruit flavors. It brings an unabashed sense of deliciousness, with a finish that won't quit."
Lava Cap,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.83,25.17,6,"This displays the immaculate freshness of all the Eyrie white wines, with an extra serving of phenolic bite. There's a sense of real depth to the gooseberry, grapefruit and pineapple flavors. Subtle and a bit enigmatic, this compelling effort should be tucked away and tasted again in 2020. Drink 2020–2030."
Lava Cap,Chardonnay,89.2,19.2,5,"Cinnamon and clove show alongside hibiscus and mulberry on the distinctive nose of this bottling that also offers hints of maple, juniper, eucalyptus and turned earth. It's soft on the sip with elegant tannins and flavors of black cherry, cherry tomato, anise and camphor on the finish."
Lava Cap,Grenache,89.0,28.0,1,"Pale to the point of being Pinot-esque, this wine draws you in with its aromas of earth, cigar box, crushed flowers, herb and sour cherry. The palate is ethereally light and elegant, fully of savory flavors and made in a transparent style. It might be too elegant for some tastes but others will swoon."
Lava Cap,Merlot,84.0,20.0,1,"This wine showcases the producer's historical devotion and prowess with the variety, leaving a light-bodied impression of floral honeysuckle, wet stone and succulent peach. Fleshy and creamy, it works on every level, and offers value at the same time."
Lava Cap,Petite Sirah,86.0,30.0,1,"A classic Cab in the Santa Cruz Mountains style, this savory bottling shows black pepper, charcoal and grilled blueberries on the nose along with tons of dried herbs. Blackberry, anise, dill, cedar and pencil lead show on the sip, where intriguing depth and a silky texture combine."
Lava Cap,Red Blend,87.0,18.0,1,"This is a robust, full-bodied wine, balanced and complex, with a lush, plush mouthfeel that's seductive and velvety. Black pepper, clove and characteristics of earthy forest floor define it most, while dark cherry nips at its sides."
Lava Cap,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,16.0,2,"This small, estate-grown red from the eastern edge of St. Helena shows meticulous care taken both in the vineyard and cellar, with its remarkably soft, integrated tannin, especially in this warm, ripe vintage. Given just 2% Petit Verdot, it shines in black pepper, black cherry and a tiny suggestion of vanilla."
Lava Cap,Syrah,91.5,22.5,2,"Brooding on the nose, this bottling by a newer producer shows crushed herbs, slate, leathery blackberry and blueberry fruit, smoked meats and a touch of minty tobacco. There is great structure on the palate, with fine-grained, chalky tannins presenting blackberry fruit, black-pepper spice, oak smoke and touches of crushed oregano."
Lava Cap,Viognier,92.0,34.0,1,"This is the first vintage of the winery's flagship wine to receive a vineyard designation. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (61%), Merlot (24%), Merlot and Petit Verdot, it offers brooding aromas of dried herbs and tobacco along with coffee and barrel spice. The style is reserved but it still brings a lot of richness along with lively acidity, exceptional balance, well-integrated tannins and a lengthy finish."
Lava Cap,Zinfandel,87.4,24.6,5,"This is a lovely, 100% varietal wine, balanced between savory, almost sanguine meaty notes, and complex layers of cassis, plum and blueberry. Medium bodied with an elegance at its core, it has streaks of subtle cinnamon that give spiciness, and a finish dusted in Mexican chocolate."
Lavinea,Chardonnay,94.0,60.0,1,"This tiny-production wine shows an attention to detail in the vineyard and cellar. The clonal selection shines, given partial barrel-fermentation, partial stainless steel, all aged in mostly neutral French oak. Honeysuckle aromas jump from the glass, followed by viscous, juicy tropical elements of mango and lychee. It finishes dry and lemony."
Lavinea,Pinot Noir,92.5,70.0,2,"Aromas of black raspberry, black cherry and a cinnamon spice are laid across a slate-driven minerality on the nose of this bottling. It's plush on the sip, with hibiscus and raspberry notes, lifted by pepper, camphor and white sage elements."
Law,Grenache,91.5,77.0,2,"From the mighty Hyde in Carneros, this medium-bodied white blossoms with tropical fruit and briny minerality, a forceful combination that gives this wine both power and elegance. Textured in candied Meyer lemon, it finishes crisply and the right kind of sour."
Law,Grenache-Syrah,93.0,65.0,1,"Slightly reductive on the nose, this bottling from a very coastal vineyard outside of Cambria shows mossy forest floor, jerked meat, dried cranberries, turned earth, sesame oil and salt on the nose. The palate combines concentrated, lush raspberry with bay leaf, lots of turned earth and chaparral seasonings."
Law,Mourvèdre,93.0,90.0,1,"Smooth and sultry purple fruit and flower notes get more specific on the black pepper and blackberry elements in this bottling from the family's original blocks, planted in 1992 and 1993. The palate is both dynamic and straightforward, with nuanced blueberry-blackberry fruits decorated by peppery spice that dances across solid structure into the long finish."
Law,Red Blend,92.5,69.0,2,"Red cherry, root beer, a touch of sage and bay leaf and an shiitake-powered umami sensation decorate the nose on this wine from one of many single-vineyard expressions in this producer's portfolio. The palate shows cooked cherries and cranberries that float across a Mediterranean elements of olive, fig balsamic and menthol."
Law,Rhône-style Red Blend,95.0,70.0,1,"The aromas of coffee, chocolate and exotic spices are brooding. Flavors are concentrated and layered, showing a good sense of texture and a light grip of tannins. The oak needs time to fully integrate."
Law,Syrah,92.33,294.67,3,Baking spice and dried cherry and cranberry aromas lead to lighter-styled fruit flavors with a gentle grip of tannins. It trails on the finish.
Lawer,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,32.0,1,Aromas of saddle leather and sour cherry are followed by lightly styled tart cherry flavors and gritty tannins.
Lawer,Chardonnay,87.75,28.5,4,"Reserved aromas of vanilla, pickling spices and cherry are followed by light cranberry flavors with the concentration wanting."
Lawer,Petite Sirah,87.5,28.0,2,This variety is a relative newcomer to the state. It intrigues with aromas of citrus and flowers that are followed by smoky flavors with a cranberry and flower-filled finish.
Lawer,Syrah,87.33,27.33,6,Bright aromas of macerated cranberries and maraschino cherries along with vanilla and wood spice accents are followed by tart and appealing fruit flavors. The oak gets a bit too prominent.
Lawer,Viognier,91.0,24.0,2,"A bit thin in color, this wine shows boisterous red raspberries and a touch of smashed incense on the nose. It's juicy and easy to drink, with red cherry and strawberry fruit spiced by pine needles."
Le Cadeau,Pinot Noir,91.07,57.11,28,"This wine has a vivid pink color, with strong aromas and flavors like canteloupe and peach. The rich, smooth texture keeps the fruit lingering through the finish."
Le Cadeau,Sparkling Blend,91.0,50.0,1,"With a vibrant orange-gold color, giant nut, honey and alcohol aromas and very full body, this bold, late-harvest-style wine compares to a rich style of Spanish Sherry. It begs for roasted, salted almonds or Serrano ham as a pairing."
Le Casque,Red Blend,90.5,26.5,2,"There's a diluted nature to this wine, from a selection of varietal clones. Dry, it holds back on flavor, delivering a light texture and soft red-fruit flavors."
Le Casque,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,28.0,1,"This blend of 70% Roussanne, 14% Grenache Blanc, 10% Viognier and 6% Picpoul Blanc shows potential but is still finding its way. Aromas of Key-lime pith, sea salt, honeydew and walnut oil lead into a slightly bitter palate with tobacco flavors, dried yellow fruit, orange rinds and more nut oils."
Le Mistral,Grenache,88.0,36.0,1,"This fruity and sweet bubbly has a vivid hot-pink color and aromas like maraschino cherries, then red-cherry flavors, a smooth texture and cotton-candy flavors on the finish."
Le Mistral,Viognier,88.0,29.0,1,"This lovely blend, inspired by the white wines of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, is 55% Roussanne, 27% Grenache Blanc, and 18% Viognier. Round and peachy, it's vividly framed by fresh acidity and citrus rind. Just 20% new French oak adds a kiss of toast to the finish."
Le Mulet Rouge,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,24.0,1,"Broadly fruity, a wash of berries and spice. The acids are still a little jarring. The vintage is not as deep as the 2007, and the wine shows a little heat in the finish. This tastes more like a press wine than the '07, but it is nonetheless very well made."
Le Mulet Rouge,Viognier,92.0,23.0,1,"This wine is principally Cabernet Sauvignon (57%) and Merlot (34%) along with dashes of Cabernet Franc and Malbec. A blend of Royal Slope and Seven Hills Vineyard fruit, it opens with aromas of black cherry, cigar box, green herbs, dried mint and potpourri. The herb and dark-fruit flavors are ripe and expressive, with the tannins combed to a fine sheen."
Le P'tit Paysan,Chardonnay,91.0,22.0,2,"Crisp green pear and a razor-thin sharpness cut into more lush kiwi and honeysuckle notes on the nose of this bottling. A steely line of Key lime slices through the white peach flavors once sipped, and the palate cleans up with a tense, chalky grip."
Le P'tit Paysan,Mourvèdre,90.0,19.0,1,"A greeting of caramel and honey reveals a touch of barrel reduction in this medium-bodied, generously layered wine. It imparts a ripeness of melon and apple, finishing in a sprinkling of nutmeg."
Le Vigne,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,42.0,2,"Dusty cedar and a faintness of rose open this wine, like walking into a lovely forest at the edge of a garden. Along with a delicate supporting role of oak and tannin, it offers black cherry, graphite and dried herb to enjoy, as well as a powerful hit of concentration on the finish."
Le Vigne,Cabernet Franc,87.33,37.0,3,"Made from 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache, both grown at the terrific Kick Ranch hillside site, this wine has a robustness of dark cherry and a red-brick color, soft, smooth and youthful in its seamless tannin and oak. Juicy dark blueberry and a touch of meaty spice form an enviable combination just ready for meaty dishes."
Le Vigne,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,36.5,2,"Juicy like a cherry cordial, this medium-bodied vineyard-designate drinks lean and gracefully, showing a spunky side seasoned in cinnamon and clove."
Le Vigne,Grenache,91.0,36.0,1,"At 81%, this could be a varietally labeled Merlot, with the rest Cabernet Franc (15%) and Petit Verdot. It appeals with pretty aromas of cocoa, wood spice and jammy red fruit that are followed by full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors that pack a wallop while staying in balance."
Le Vigne,Petite Sirah,90.0,37.0,3,"Winemaker Molly Lyman takes a delicate approach to this 100% varietal estate wine, from a longstanding vineyard in the Chiles Valley. From a block named for a farming family linked to the site, Las Flores is sanguine in cranberry and graphite, food-friendly, with a lightness despite its pronounced plum, cassis and oak."
Le Vigne,Red Blend,89.5,41.75,4,"This is a rare, 100% varietal, single-vineyard Malbec. It downright dazzles with notes of dark plum and spice that are followed by seamless, pure, elegant fruit flavors."
Le Vigne,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,41.0,3,"Hailing from some of the oldest blocks at this esteemed vineyard, this standout wine opens with aromas of toasty spices, herbs, coffee, dark cherry and earth. The palate is reserved with tightly wound fruit flavors and tannins that need some time to unfurl."
Le Vigne,Sangiovese,89.67,35.0,3,"From an 850-foot-elevation site four miles from the ocean, this offers a depth of dark cherry and Asian spice, lightly bodied and textured. It delivers a hit of bittersweet chocolate on the tangy finish, with an intriguing streak of charcuterie that's hard to shake."
Le Vigne,Tannat,89.0,35.5,2,"This 100% Cabernet, from the iconic Klipsun vineyard, has been sourced from the original 1989 planting since the first crop, making Seven Hills Klipsun's longest standing customer. This offers deep cassis, mineral, and earth flavors, powerful and dense. The Seven Hills style, ordinarily restrained and elegant, suits this vineyard especially well, as it reins in the tendency of Klipsun fruit to go over the top, and become too tannic. This is muscular and deep, but proportionate and detailed."
Le Vigne,White Blend,89.0,21.0,1,"You have to love the '07 vintage. This is drinking beautifully right now, though official release (September) is still a ways off. Rich and delicious, full-bodied and aromatic, with exotic barrel scents and a lovely mélange of chocolate, mocha, caramel and spice. But the fruit is the main story, and it's full, ripe and substantial—cherry and cassis, licorice and just a hint of leaf."
Lea,Chardonnay,90.0,32.0,2,"This single-vineyard blend's flavors run through all the berries right into dense cassis. It gathers more strength as it rolls through the midpalate, layering in earth and black cherries, with char and toast more noticeable than in the other Tamarack reds."
Leah Jørgensen Cellars,Cabernet Franc,89.67,30.83,6,"Dark, bold, and full-bodied, this is the perfect embodiment of power and breed in a full-on (five grape) Bordeaux blend. Boysenberry, cassis, plenty of acidity—the nose promises a great deal, though it is reticent in the mouth, and fairly acidic. This is a wine to lay down and enjoy in a decade."
Leah Jørgensen Cellars,Malbec,87.0,30.0,1,"Supple and layered, this nicely captures the scope and scale of this superb vintage. It's still young, tight and quite compact, but shows threads of tobacco, anise, stone and pencil lead, along with full, fleshy, plum and cassis fruit. Great structure and dense, ripe tannins. This is a perfect illustration of why Washington Merlot can claim to be the best in the world outside of Pomerol."
Leah Jørgensen Cellars,Red Blend,88.0,25.0,2,"This is always a topflight bottling, and winemaker Ron Bunnell gets the same rows and uses the same barrel regimen and winemaking methods. So what is different? Vintage variation. In 2006 the wines are tighter and slower to open, perhaps longer lived, and show less of the immediately seductive fruit flavors of 2005. Boushey-McPherson is naturally sharp and edgy when young anyway, and those characteristics are much in evidence here, so this is a wine to decant if you plan to drink it anytime soon."
Leah Jørgensen Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,20.0,1,"Dark, thick and aromatic, this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 5% Syrah can stand alongside others selling for two or three times the price. It's a supple mix of dark fruits and spicy herb; it almost bristles with sharp hints of nettle, pepper and green tea. The tannins are supple and smooth, and there is a polish to the wine that extends into a smooth, seamless and very satisfying finish."
Ledger David,Chenin Blanc,91.0,20.0,1,"The blend is 37% Marsanne, 33% Grenache Blanc, 20% Picpoul and 10% Roussanne. Among McCrea's Rhône-inspired white wines, this is the most complete and complex. The stony, textural underpinning adds a lot of depth while the fruit mixes citrus and melon with hints of just-ripe green banana and papaya. It's a juicy yet subtle wine, with aging potential over the next half decade or so."
Ledger David,Red Blend,85.0,33.0,1,"A pure Syrah from estate fruit, this dark, peppery, earthy wine is saturated with color and ripe fruit flavor. From the Yakima Valley estate, it buttresses the currant and cherry fruit with polished tannins that add many layers of depth and nuances of earth and smoke. The extra bottle time (this is the current release) has also helped to smooth out the rough edges. As the estate vineyard ages and the vines mature, these wines are gaining in both strength and detail."
Ledger David,Tempranillo,86.0,35.0,1,"This is definitely one of Washington's best Sangioveses, capturing the astringency and natural acidity of the grape, but filling in the mid-palate with chewy fruit flavors of berry and spicy cranberry. The light herbal characteristics of the vineyard come through, adding details of leaf and herb. Since this is a 2004, it is already showing some development in the bottle and is drinking very well right now."
Ledson,Pinot Noir,92.0,60.0,1,"This was picked at the same time as the regular Viognier, but fermentation was stopped, leaving it as a sweet wine (about 4.8% r.s.). The fruit is laced with honey, lime and apricot; it's delicious without being cloying."
Ledson,Red Blend,86.0,56.0,1,"Blueberry, wet tobacco, charred beef, cedar and a touch of dried herbs show on the nose of this bottling. There is tons of acidity on the palate, where dense and dark purple fruits meet with cocoa dust, incense and woody spice, culiminating in a long finish."
Ledson,Zinfandel,88.0,68.0,1,"Generously filling and satisfying, this Bordeaux-styled blend is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. It's medium in oak and tannin, with a toasty character underlying red cherry, currant and cassis, the ending marked by cedar and clove."
Lee Family Farm,Red Blend,88.0,16.0,1,"Decadent chocolate and coconut macaroon accent sweet tannin and generous oak in this softly textured wine, made in small amounts. The finish is powerful and ripe."
Lee Family Farm,Tempranillo Blend,90.0,16.0,1,"Candied cherries, black plums, dried sage scrub and turned earth show on the nose of this bottling, which offers more rustic flair than other Zins. Once sipped, waves of crushed oregano, marjoram and dill take over, followed by red plum and touches of baked raspberry and boysenberry fruit."
Lee Family Farm,Verdelho,88.0,15.0,1,"This wine is half Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Syrah. Aromas of vanilla, dill and candied cherries are followed by ripe, succulent red and black-fruit flavors, with firm, drying tannins providing support."
Leese-Fitch,Red Blend,87.0,12.0,1,"The aromas are light, with notes of yellow apple and spice. The palate is rounded in feel, showing a lovely sense of texture."
Left Bend,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,38.0,1,"Light and simplistic compared to other bottlings from the winery, this is still quite tasty, with aromas of lemon curd, sliced green apple and tangerine blossom. The palate shows stone fruit, vanilla cream and lemon wedges, with a decently grippy tension."
Left Bend,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,50.0,2,"Angels is made from a majority of Merlot, the balance nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Black pepper, clove and a whiff of Dr Pepper give it a spiciness that's also fruity, while a softness of texture and medium body maintain approachability."
Left Bend,Pinot Noir,91.0,40.0,1,"Beguiling aromas of corn silk, vanilla, barrel spice and malolactic notes lead to a palate that is elegant in style. It dances lightly."
Left Bend,Red Blend,90.0,44.67,3,"From a newer vineyard located up Gypsy Canyon off of Highway 246, this wine shows light apple aromas along with lemon blossoms. Ripe yellow pears and apples show through a stony tightness that frames the midpalate, offering a Key-lime pith element and good saline quality."
Left Bend,Syrah,93.0,35.0,2,"A 100% varietal wine from near the town of Glen Ellen, this is a healthy marriage of power and grace. The wine is fiery in leathery tannin and full-bodied blackberry ripeness laced in cinnamon and black pepper. Aged in new French oak, it's structured and age-worthy, though quite enjoyable now."
Left Bend,Viognier,91.0,32.0,1,"This is a relatively light-bodied and elegant version of the variety, softly approachable and enjoyable even in its youth. Leathery pepper sits atop nuanced layers of chocolate and blueberry, with a tang of sour cherry and a leanness to the finish."
Left Coast Cellars,Chardonnay,87.67,22.67,3,"Aromas of raspberries, vanilla and coconut lead to lightly styled fruit and barrel flavors. It's all about elegance."
Left Coast Cellars,Pinot Blanc,87.25,20.0,4,"This is an appropriately dark and leathery wine, saddle-like in aroma, with firm traces of black pepper. Blueberry tart and violet provide further complexity and invitation."
Left Coast Cellars,Pinot Gris,88.17,20.5,6,"Fuzzy peach with a companionable co-host of Meyer lemon star in this medium-bodied, voluptuously appealing wine. It's balanced and easy to enjoy, its finish taking on added volume and likability."
Left Coast Cellars,Pinot Noir,88.05,31.95,22,"From a cool site overlooking the ocean in Occidental, this is a feral, earthy wine, with a nose of garden patch, black tea and orange. Juicy at its core, it's structured in smooth tannin. Hints of new oak provide pleasant accents without overburdening the herbal and fruity core."
Legendre,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,23.5,4,This wine opens with aromas of apricot and pear. The flavors coat the palate while showing a lot of restraint and exquisite balance.
Legendre,Viognier,88.0,24.0,1,"Marzipan, marshmallow, cotton candy, churned butter and pie crust show on the very buttery but fascinating nose of this bottling, made by a winery that likes lots of bottle age. Broad, hearty, ripe and delicious flavors of butter, meringue and vanilla are leveled by sour yellow apple touches and an intriguing chive and Maui onion element."
Lemelson,Pinot Gris,89.0,18.8,5,"This is a very full and deep wine, with aromas of black plum, mulberry, Dr Pepper, mint-chocolate chip and purple flowers. It's hearty on the palate as well, with black tea and rose petals showing alongside thick, rich mulberry, clove and baking spice galore. It's not dainty at all."
Lemelson,Pinot Noir,89.95,45.3,20,"This wine is a blend of fruit from Alder Ridge and Olsen Vineyards. Aged in older barrels, it displays mesmerizingly pure aromas of raspberry, mortared dried herbs and pot roast. The flavors are elegant, textured and detailed, displaying a fine sense of balance along with plenty of length. It takes some time to get going but once it does it sails."
Lemelson,Riesling,89.25,19.25,4,"The oak is quite apparent on this bottling, and that's the point. Red apple, ripe pear, pomelo pith and sweetgrass meet with a touch of honey on the nose. The palate shows the oak more prominently, with light honey butter, sweet almond and vanilla, yet fresh, grassy notes shine through on the finish."
Leo Steen Wines,Chenin Blanc,90.33,24.67,3,"This wine is named for the four Sullivan brothers, one of whom makes the Benovia wines and another who makes this wine, among others. A clear labor of love, this small-production Chardonnay is well tended to. A sweetness of honeysuckle opens on the nose, followed by a depth of vanilla oak and stony minerality, the acidity fresh and bright."
Leonard Wine Company,Zinfandel,90.0,50.0,1,"Tons of spice notes entertain the nose on this bottling, from white pepper and dill to sandalwood and incense, all against a cranberry-fruit backdrop. The palate, framed by an impressive though not oppressive structure, shows a touch of pasilla chile and black pepper before riper boysenberry and cranberry arise in the midpalate. Rose petals, pencil lead, thyme and oregano add nuance."
Leoness,Merlot,91.0,46.0,1,"The aromas of dark coffee, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and black cherry are still locked up but provide appeal. The flavors are textured and full, showing layers of dark fruit that undulate into the distance and display a fine sense of balance."
Leoness,Red Blend,89.0,95.0,1,"A vineyard-designate since 2007, this wine shows vigor and volatility in the glass, a mix of white pepper, heightened acidity and an underlay of black tea and forest floor. Brooding in dark berry, it never lets the fruit become entirely ripe, opting instead for savory complexity."
Leoness,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,95.0,1,"Light hay in color and with a creamy, near-perfect foam, this sparkler shows fresh Asian pear, light plumeria, wet river stone and rain-on-sidewalk aromas, altogether quite minerally on the nose. Impressively textural, it's cleansing on the palate, a bit like licking chalk, with flavors of lemon skin, tart yellow-apple rind and crisp pear flesh."
Leoness,Syrah,90.14,55.14,7,"Almost three-quarters of this blend is made up of Cabernet Sauvignon (45%) and Malbec (30%), with smaller additions of Petit Verdot, Carmenere, Syrah and Merlot. Together they sing, loudly, in a lush, structured explosion of plummy blackberry, boysenberry, leather and espresso. A bright current of acidity throughout keeps it fresh in the glass."
Leoness,Zinfandel,87.0,49.0,1,"This wine is principally Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), with the rest equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of dried herb, black cherry, licorice, cocoa and barrel spice give way to plentiful tart-cherry flavors backed by bright acidity and lightly chewy tannins. It stretches out on the finish."
Leonesse Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,85.0,28.0,1,"This wine is 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Petit Verdot and 8% Merlot, coming from Seven Hills, Loess and Mill Creek Upland vineyards. Light aromas of toast, barrel tones, flowers, licorice and dark fruit are followed by earth and other savory flavors that are light but still show weight and density."
Leonesse Cellars,Syrah,89.67,61.33,3,"This opens with a pleasing toasty aroma, following through on the palate. That deft touch of French oak (33% new) frames a solid core of strawberry preserves and Bing cherry fruit. It resonates on through a stylish, textural finish. Enjoy this immediately, and tuck away a few bottles to drink in five years."
Leonetti Cellar,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.86,143.57,7,"If you've ever had a Momtazi wine, you know that there is a strong earthy aspect to the flavors that sets the vineyard apart from most others. In the scents and tastes here you'll find composted earth, chalk, dried leaves and black tea ahead of black cherry fruit, but those funk-soaked flavors add up to a complex and intriguing wine."
Leonetti Cellar,Red Blend,95.0,130.0,2,"The producer concocts this fun blend every year from different varieties, this vintage a combination of 58% Syrah, 32% Zinfandel and 10% Grenache. Funky earth and mushroom meet thick, full-bodied waves of blueberry and blackberry bramble, riding smooth, textured waves of big, lengthy flavor."
Lepe,Chardonnay,92.0,25.0,1,"Inky purple, as you might expect after 23 days on the skins, this hits the palate forcefully with flavors of blueberry, black cherry, mown grass and mulch. Tannins are thick and chewy, and the finish turns a bit chalky."
Les Belles Collines,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.33,86.67,3,"Young and still coming out of its cocoon, this Home Ranch Cab is a wall of tannins waiting to break free into nuances of cassis, cherry, mint and dark chocolate. Plenty structured, it's made in small quantities and is worth aging until 2024–2034 for those tannins to soften around their edges."
Les Trouvés,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,25.0,1,"A light wine with a hit of oak midpalate, this offers bright red cherry and black currant fruit with a suggestion of thyme and toffee on the finish. Smooth to drink, it's a fine choice for red-meat dishes like beef lasagne."
Les Voleurs,Pinot Noir,88.0,45.0,1,"This Cab has a prominent streak of eucalyptus-like menthol on the nose as well as cranberry. This continues on the palate, which is fairly juicy and soft. With dry tannins the finish is on the dusty side, a pairing quandary solved most likely by juicy red meat."
Leto,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,82.5,2,"Veteran winemaker John Abbott (Chalone, Canoe Ridge, Abeja) jumps back on the Pinot Noir wagon with this new project. This is the second vintage for his Freedom Hill designate, a vintage that was notoriously difficult due to monsoon-like rains mid-harvest. Abbott cajoles the grapes into an elegant, refined expression of high-acid Pinot Noir. Slightly saline, with mountain strawberry fruit and autumnal (forest floor) accents, this is lean but polished, and should cellar well now through 2022."
Leto,Chardonnay,87.0,34.5,2,"This proprietary blend combines 52% Cabernet Franc, 34% Merlot and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, another in its line of Aaron Pott-made wines. It's lovable in its austerity and varietal suggestions of dried herb, cedar and green bean. Dusty, soft tannins support a full-bodied, straightforward structure."
Leto,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,24.33,3,"Rich in body but light in tannins, this warm, generous wine fills the mouth and eases down the throat. It has a good mélange of cherry, strawberry and floral aromas, satisfying fruit flavors and a nicely soft finish."
Levendi,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.25,55.0,4,"This pure varietal bottling spent two years in barrel. It's extremely leathery, dried out, and smells and tastes of the tack room. This is not terroir. It's most likely barrel-related."
Levendi,Chardonnay,88.0,40.0,2,"This is an incredibly beautiful and yes, joyful, sparkler, made from equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This particular offering was disgorged in July 2016. It positively impresses in minerality, complemented by a more fulsome sense of lemon, apple and hazelnut on the creamy palate, leaving a rich trail of silk on the finish."
Levendi,Pinot Noir,91.0,43.33,3,"This is a beautiful, complex and complete wine, from the delicate, spiced raspberry aroma through the creamy, nuanced finish. Subtle but well-defined fruit flavors like white cherry and raspberry pulse across the palate, buoyed by an ultrafine effervescence and lively acidity. But the texture is smooth around the edges, lending a sense of extra depth and layering to this extraordinary bottle. Just coming into its own now, it will improve through at least 2020."
Leverage,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,50.0,2,"An offering meant to toast all manner of celebrations, this wine wows, blending 78% Pinot Noir with 22% Chardonnay in a near-perfect union. Dry and beautifully floral, it opens in a bouquet of marzipan, peach and honey. The mousse is fine, while supporting acidity lends a lemon peel and grapefruit lift. The memory imprinted on the palate will linger long after all the toasts to the happy couple—or whatever else you're celebrating—have been made."
Levo,Rhône-style White Blend,90.0,36.0,2,"A designation used only when a vintage deserves, this reserve is definitely worthy. Almost a decade after bottling, it offers an intensity of chocolate, cinnamon and clove against soft, mellowed and structured tannin. Dusty sage and a bramble of blackberry complete the picture. It may have another five to seven years of beauty left within, but why wait?"
Levo,Syrah,88.0,36.0,1,"The new oak is dialed down a bit to 33% in this memorable red from the producer's estate Quail Hill Vineyard. Lovely in every way, it opens in rose petals and a subtlety of Asian five-spice, before a succulence of cranberry, rhubarb and orange unleash a fullness of fruit and lush texture on the palate."
Lexington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,95.0,2,"Along with a fascinating nose, this bottling from the appellation's westernmost vineyard offers the rounded ripeness of cherimoya, nectarine and white peach but with a laser-sharp line of crushed sea shell and flint minerality alongside scratched lemon skin. The palate rides that chalky line the whole way, offering hints of lime pith, tangerine, sea salt and just enough almond warmth."
Lexington,Cabernet Franc,90.5,45.0,2,"Very savory aromas of roasted lamb, bacon fat, teriyaki and crushed pepper meet with light blueberry and a touch of mint on the nose of this delicious, well-rounded bottling by winemaker Sashi Moorman from the vineyard's oldest blocks. The palate kicks off with a zesty acidity, then come waves of black pepper-crusted beef roast, oregano, bay leaf, dark plum fruit and lavender. The solid structure ensures cellar potential but it's ready to drink today."
Lexington,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,55.0,2,"Allen Vineyard grapes have the maturity and complexity to impart a boldly balanced roundness of lemon curd, fig and apple, plus a searing undercurrent of salty minerality. With substantial weight, and texture for miles, it remains bright and fresh in the glass, with a lingering impression of cinnamon toast."
Lexington,Malbec,89.0,45.0,1,"A prime example of why Pinot Noir is great to release later in its life, this six-year-old wine is signing with concentrated strawberry, iron, dried rose petals, stewed black cherry and raw beef. The palate is quite earthy but also packs black plum, vanilla, pepper, thyme and marjoram into a wondrous and complete package."
Lexington,Merlot,89.0,45.0,1,"High toned and sharp edged, this should probably be consumed quickly. Scents of petrol run into a barely-ripe flavor of rhubarb."
Liberty Lake,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,50.0,1,"This old-vine Zinfandel with a dusting of Petite Sirah and Tannat in the blend is stewy, soft and fairly simple."
Liberty Lake,Red Blend,87.5,30.75,4,"Direct and easygoing, this Zinfandel tastes of blackberry, bacon, clove and pepper. The oak is tame, and the wine is ready to drink."
Lieb,Chardonnay,86.0,15.0,1,"Delicate and pretty, this has a pale cherry flavor, with light but proportionate tannins. It fades a bit quickly, offering a final hint of milk chocolate."
Limerick Lane,Red Blend,94.0,70.0,1,"This is almost entirely Syrah, done in a high-acid, citrusy style. Flavors are sharply etched and tight—pomegranate, raspberry, baking chocolate and espresso. Straightforward and well-balanced despite its 15% alcohol."
Limerick Lane,Rosé,93.0,28.0,2,"This vintage of Svelte is still rough around the edges, with chalky, slightly green tannins sticking out. The fruit seems to be hiding behind the earthy components, and some unusual flavors of bread dough and biscuit are also in the mix. This is a wine that's tough to sort out."
Limerick Lane,Syrah,94.0,47.5,2,"Lightly fined and unfiltered, it's slightly cloudy in appearance with notes of mineral, citrus, herbs and spice. Aged partly in neutral oak, with the rest in stainless steel, the flavors are light, with a creamy midpalate and tart, electric acids, that verge on sour. Pair this with shellfish to see it at its best."
Limerick Lane,Syrah-Grenache,92.0,50.0,2,"Lifted by notes of pear, petroleum jelly and apricot, it's medium bodied and drinks off dry (6 g/L residual sugar) with a tart, lingering finish."
Limerick Lane,Zinfandel,93.88,52.12,8,"No information was given as far as whether this was entirely stainless fermented, but that is the clear impression. Light fruit flavors of apple, pear, and green banana combine in a crisp wine that is modest in scale, balanced and fresh."
Lincourt,Chardonnay,90.67,30.67,9,"The Cabernet in this blend is Cabernet Franc, making it a Right Bank Bordeaux-style blend, at an astonishingly low price. Tart berry fruit and some stiff tannins suggest that a bit more bottle age may help to soften it; there are already some pleasing suggestions of barrel toast that run through the aromas and on into the finish."
Lincourt,Pinot Noir,91.25,45.0,8,"This new wine from Efeste is a Right bank, Bordeaux-style blend of Merlot, Cab Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Tight and unyielding, even after many hours of breathing time, it's difficult to assess at this stage. Moderately ripe fruit remains closed down, showing gentle hints of sweet tomato, pomegranate and dried herbs."
Lineage,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.0,145.0,1,"Dark pink-orange in color, this pungent 100% varietal wine was given no time in oak, allowing its crisp orange peel, grapefruit and cherry flavors to shine. Moderate acidity underlies the simple finish."
Lineage,Red Blend,94.0,135.0,1,"Blackberry, rose petal and espresso combine for a relatively light aromatic profile in this blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Cabernet Franc and 20% Merlot. A cedar flavor dominates the palate, lending structure and depth to blackberry fruit and black pepper spice."
Liparita,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.5,60.0,2,Plum and bubblegum aromas show on the inviting nose of this bottling from the Barton family. There is an energetic tension to the palate that propels its light raspberry fruit flavors into the finish.
Liquid Farm,Chardonnay,92.29,50.29,7,"This blends 65% Cabernet Sauvignon and 35% Syrah to create a juicy expression of both varieties. Cassis, vanilla and blackberry notes show both aromatically and in flavor, as the wine builds in depth and concentration."
Liquid Farm,Rosé,90.0,23.0,1,"The aromas show notes of herb, jalapeño pepper, dark fruit, and barrel spice, with the alcohol poking through a touch. The flavors are medium bodied, brightened by tart acidity. Grainy tannins back it all up."
Little Giant,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,55.0,1,"This wine is 100% varietal coming from one of the top vineyards in the state. Reserved aromas of spice box, blackberry, barrel tones and gun smoke lead to elegantly styled fruit flavors. There are some interesting thing going on but they don't all come together at present."
Lobo,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.4,72.4,5,"Opening with a touch of petrol-like reduction on the nose, this Eastside Road-grown wine imparts lighter shades of apple blossom and grapefruit pith, while a well-hewn foundation of minerality forms its core. Deep toffee, caramel and fig tones develop in the glass, with an intensity of body and warmth on the finish."
Lobo,Chardonnay,94.0,60.0,1,"Concentrated cherry and plum aromas meet with iron, cinnamon and gingersnap on the nose of this single-vineyard wine. The flavors surpass the aromas in succulence—star anise, nutmeg and bay leaf seemingly wrapped in buttered pastry."
Lobo,Red Blend,91.0,65.0,1,"Velvety and plush on the palate, this classic Cabernet offers firm, youthful tannins and full-bodied concentration of dense black fruit. Cedar, dried herb and tobacco scents frame its core, broadcasting a burning intensity and sanguine chewiness. Cellar and enjoy best 2023–2033."
Lobo,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,65.0,1,"The nose of this bottling from actress Challen Cates impresses with its spicy cherry, mulberry, juniper and mace notes. The palate is silky in texture and extremely well integrated, long-lasting and layered, with shiitake mushroom, forest floor, red cherry and earthy loam flavors."
Lobo Hills,Auxerrois,90.0,22.0,1,"Viscous and dark in the glass, this can be none other than a Daou wine. The telltale crème de cassis, black cherry, mocha and espresso aromas lead to a palate of exotic black spice and concentrated fruit, its blackberry and blueberry flavors accented with hoisin notes. It has enough structure to age but is also accessible now."
Lobo Hills,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,35.0,1,"Lilac, crème de cassis and grape Jolly Rancher scents are layered with anise and lavender touches on the nose of this bottling from one of the winery's favorite vineyards. The palate dives into deep fruit flavors, like concentrated boysenberry and olallieberry, enlivened by Christmas spice, juniper and pine. It's all framed by an intense and unwavering tannic structure. Drink now–2028."
Lobo Hills,Chenin Blanc,90.0,22.0,2,"From a cool and fog-steeped pocket of the appellation, this wine is defined by its vibrant acidity and grippy structure. The densely packed palate features dried apricot, lime peel and nutmeg spice within a medium-bodied frame, those flavors lingering long into the finish."
Lobo Hills,Syrah,90.0,30.0,2,"Elegant and tightly wound kirsch, crème de cassis, charred beef and toffee aromas show on the nose of this blend of 55% Merlot and 45% Cabernet Sauvignon. Its toffee flavor is laced with chocolate and charcoal on the palate, and its sticky tannins need time to smooth out. Drink 2019–2029."
Locati Cellars,Orange Muscat,82.0,18.0,1,"Roasted meat, rosemary, peppercorn, dried flower and blackberry notes show on the wondrously gamy nose of this wine. The palate echos that savory style, with generous lamb, char, dark berry and peppercorn flavors."
Locati Cellars,Red Blend,84.5,22.5,2,"Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens. Rich and lavish on the palate, it has fine tannins that frame its blueberry, cassis and mocha flavors. It's firmly structured, with a lingering acidity."
Locations,Red Blend,88.0,20.0,1,"This power-packed blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Malbec offers superripe cassis, fudge, vanilla bean and burnt coffee aromas. That coffee element carries over to the lush and softly structured palate, melding with blueberry, caramel and pork fat flavors, a meaty spice note adding to the deliciousness."
Locations,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,20.0,1,"ONX's current releases are quite delicious and complex. This rich, multi-layered blend of 63% Syrah, 21% Malbec, 11% Grenache and 5% Petite Sirah shows blackened plum, blueberry, soy, porcini mushroom and pepper notes on the nose. On the palate, blackberry, charred lamb and rosemary flavors are the story, framed by upright structure and powerful acidity."
Locations,White Blend,92.0,20.0,1,"If you are a fan of Rosenblum Zins, you might want to try this Washington Zin, styled in the same 16.4% alcohol mode. It's got plenty of syrupy berry fruit, and some very chocolaty streaks as well, but the tannins are earthy and still have a bitter finish to them. The winery's regular Zin is far better."
Lockwood,Chardonnay,85.0,15.0,1,"Puckering in tannins with a rubbery imprint around blackberry and black tar, this is a huge wine that may need a bit of decanting to enjoy."
Locus,Syrah,90.0,25.0,2,"Chalky and thin, this shows no particular varietal character. It looks as if it's already fading, and flavors taste woody and dull. Two bottles tasted; same notes."
Locus,Sémillon,84.0,15.0,1,"Iron, pomegranate and dust aromas show on the nose of this entry-level bottling from the Los Gatos producer. Bright red fruits and solid brown spice show on the palate that proves light, airy and easy as it dances across the tongue with energy."
Lois Rae,Syrah,88.0,35.0,1,"Floral, grapefruity aromas and sweet honey and peach flavors make this a very effusive and fruity wine. Though rich with flavor it's not cloying and is light bodied."
Loken Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,26.0,2,"Most Airfield Estate wines are single variety; this is their Bordeaux-style blend, made from five Bordeaux grape varieties. More than 50% Cabernet Sauvignon sourced from young vines, it's bright with fresh red berry and pomegranate fruit, set amidst a generous splash of brown spices. The wines spent two years in 50% new French oak, and should continue to improve over the next five years."
Loken Cellars,Rosé,80.0,18.0,1,"Soft and lightly buttery, this offers clean fruit flavors of apple and pear. Not quite as concentrated as previous efforts, perhaps a reflection of a cooler vintage in this northern location."
Loma Prieta,Pinotage,87.0,45.0,1,"This brings a tight but well-balanced blend of cranberry and raspberry fruit flavors, with snappy acidity. The fruit is bolstered with firm, lightly earthy tannins. It was aged in a mix of half American, half French, all-neutral oak."
Lone Madrone,Nebbiolo,93.0,60.0,2,"This is mostly Syrah, with 17% Mourvèdre and 5% co-fermented Viognier as well. Dark, sappy and substantial, it's a pleasing mix of black fruits, juicy in the mouth, and with a finishing streak of coffee liqueur."
Lone Madrone,Red Blend,90.83,44.67,6,"This is a Bordeaux-style blend with 60% Cabernet Franc as its anchor. Brambly berry flavors of strawberry and raspberry meld into a plummy middle, with the concentration of fruit preserves. The acidity is sufficient to keep it from becoming too soft, and the tannins are pleasant but subdued. This is a tasty bottle ready to enjoy immediately."
Lone Madrone,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.83,38.0,6,"This is a lovely bottle from this Idaho producer with notes of hay, butter, spice and melon. It has a broad, creamy feel that lingers on the finish."
Lone Madrone,Rhône-style White Blend,90.0,35.0,2,"Malbec is probably the most under-rated Washington red, but a wine such as this may change that. It's beautifully styled, tight in the midpalate, but with a broadly fruity entry that mixes berry and plum, cassis and chocolate, with a vein of mint. Winemaker Chuck Reininger has a masterful touch with tannins, and as with the rest of his reds, this is smooth and seductive, without harsh edges but with firmness and flesh. Young and primary, it looks to be a wine that can age for up to a decade."
Lone Madrone,White Blend,88.0,25.0,1,"This Mourvèdre/Syrah blend has loads of wild berry and black cherry, spiced up with tarragon and other herbs. The Syrah fills in the middle with juicy berry and peppery spice. The tannins are balanced and firm, barky but not overpowering."
Lone Madrone,Zinfandel,89.86,47.57,7,"There's a reduced quality to this wine and much ado about oak, in which it spent time (30% new French). Founder and winemaker Mark Lyon owns the 122-acre site where the Sauvignon Blanc blocks date back to 1973. A hit of jalapeño dominates on the finish."
Long Point,Riesling,85.0,14.0,1,"Rather lean aromas and spare fruit flavors meet more lavishly rich flavors for dual personalities in this medium-bodied, soft-textured and slightly sweet wine."
Long Point,Rosé,82.0,9.0,1,A strong almond and marzipan aroma jumps out of the glass. Flavors are quite fruity and the almond note isn't as strong as in the aromas. This wine is softly sparkling and somewhat sweet.
Longboard,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.5,42.0,2,"With its dried herb, parsley, cherry and spice aromas, this could only be Cabernet Sauvignon. Its cherry and raspberry flavors are bright yet subtle, carrying long into the finish."
Longboard,Chardonnay,91.33,51.0,3,"Golden in the glass, this bottling shows intriguing aromas of dried lemon peels, scratched grapefruit, blood orange rinds, crushed chalk, sea salt and a touch of peach custard. The palate offers a touch of limestone minerality with seared orange, warm chamomile and vanilla toward the finish."
Longboard,Merlot,88.0,30.0,1,"From 30-year-old vines, this is one of the finest examples of this variety to come out of the state in recent vintages. It delivers citrus, candlewax, lees, apple and pear aromas, the palate sleekly styled with a blast of acidity that makes it a versatile pour for the dinner table."
Longboard,Pinot Noir,90.0,55.0,1,"Attractive roasted, smoky aromas join ripe plum and blackberry flavors in this full-bodied, broadly textured wine. It's a great value and packs plenty of fruitiness into a rather big, moderately tannic frame."
Longboard,Red Blend,88.0,24.0,2,"An elegant, compelling Chardonnay, its fruit accented with lemon, honey and lime. Low cropping of Dijon clone 76 has concentrated the flavors (and the alcohol—a surprising 15.7%) without turning the wine into an overblown fat boy. Nuanced and long, it is one of the most satisfying Chardonnays to come out of Oregon in recent memory."
Longboard,Sparkling Blend,90.25,51.75,4,"Biodynamically farmed, this young vineyard seems to improve with each new vintage. More and more you find an expression of soil details—delicate streaks of dried leaf, moist loam, a flavor of clay. The fruit is refined and perfectly ripe, without being fleshy. An elegant style, cellar-worthy but delicious already."
Longboard,Syrah,91.0,62.0,2,"Another small-production stunner from Terre Rouge, this Syrah is still young and tight but potentially potent. The wine opens with notes of white pepper and mushroom, dirt and earth, delving from there into herbs and plenty of berries. Very savory it will pair deliciously with Gruyère, bacon and mushroom, preferably all together in a quiche or tart."
Longevity,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,39.0,2,"This new offering is light and elegant, with tart fruit flavors of rhubarb and pomegranate. There's an herbal edge to the wine, all in proportion, with generous acidity that could reward a few more years in the bottle."
Longevity,Red Blend,87.33,34.67,3,"Another fine example of Bechthold's dry-farmed, old, gnarled-vine beauty in a glass, this wine is light in color and high-toned in cherry and rhubarb fruit. Buoyed by acidity, the finish offers just a light seasoning of pepper."
Longevity,Rosé,88.0,22.0,1,"The hallmark of Angela Soleno's wines is a sweet, spicy and earthy tobacco note, and this blend of 33% Merlot, 33% Petit Verdot and 33% Sangiovese offers it in droves. Combine that with rich black plum, fresh-picked lilac and rose scents, cinnamon and red currant flavors and soft, creamy tannins, and it's a stunning wine."
Longoria,Albariño,90.5,24.0,2,"This wine is beautifully floral, with a honeyed touch of apple blossom on the nose. Stony mineral and sea breeze accents add to its complexity, as seductive, smooth layers of creme brûlée and preserved lemon flavor provide oomph and grace."
Longoria,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,42.0,1,"This smooth, velvety powerhouse is a rich, rewarding mix of dark chocolate and raspberry compote flavors, with integrated oak. With its succulent, full-bodied layers of ripe fruit, it pleases the palate in lavish luxury."
Longoria,Chardonnay,92.17,49.17,6,"These biodynamic grapes, fermented with native yeasts, spent three months in 40% new French oak. It's built like a precision watch, ticking off complete and balanced varietal flavors of citrus rind and juice, with light touches of fresh herb, lemon verbena and a delicate hint of vanilla."
Longoria,Pinot Noir,92.0,48.5,12,"The nose of this bottling from winemaker Tyler Thomas is simultaneously delicate and voluptuous, with strawberry, plump plum, crushed slate and pepper seasonings. The palate is focused, with fresh red fruit, a rocky structure and strong thyme, marjoram and sage characteristics. Soft and delicious, it finishes with a dried strawberry kick."
Longoria,Red Blend,87.5,30.0,2,"This classic-style wine has cedar, tobacco and dark fruit aromas, bold and ripe flavors and a structure that's very firm yet not harsh. Cinnamon, clove and allspice accents complement its black cherry and dark chocolate notes, while a thick blanket of tannin wraps it all up."
Longplay,Chardonnay,87.0,25.0,4,"This is a juicy, succulent and high-toned wine aged in both stainless steel and French oak. From a site rich in volcanic soils, it exudes a flinty, stony element that's incredibly compelling, accented with passionfruit and grapefruit flavors and driven by lengthy acidity."
Longplay,Pinot Noir,87.56,30.33,9,"A strong chaparral spice note marks the nose of this bottling, with background aromas of roast pork, sage, blueberry syrup and Dr. Pepper. Framed by firm but forgiving tannins, the palate offers cracked pepper, blackened lamb, pine forest and rosemary flavors."
Longship,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,38.0,1,"Impressively dark and dense in the glass, this bottling from Edgar Torres from a coastal site offers pungent black currant, leather, wet asphalt and black pepper aromas. The palate's charred black plum flavors are wrapped in serious tannins and bolstered by bright acidity. This will evolve into a stellar wine with patience. Drink 2020–2034."
Longship,Chardonnay,87.0,24.0,1,"This succulent wine's brawny earth is steadied by fresh acidity, adding tart flavors of tangy rhubarb, cranberry and rose. Crushed rock and dried herb notes add savory complexity and texture, but it's the pretty aromas that ultimately seize the day."
Longship,Red Blend,87.0,36.0,1,"Cline's Oakley is more than halfway made up of Syrah, with smaller smatterings of Petite Sirah, Barbera and Cabernet Franc. The tinkering in the cellar works, the wine refreshing in strawberry jam, soft and rich with an herbal presence and kiss of vanilla on the finish."
Longship,Rosé,85.0,20.0,1,"Kana's Workingman's Red has turned into a southern Rhône style blend of six grapes, the only outlier being a splash of Tempranillo. Toasty, round and easy-drinking, it's a good, all-purpose barbecue red, with a smoky, espresso-scented finish."
Longship,Syrah,87.0,32.0,1,"Estate-grown in the San Juan islands, this did well in 2012, a relatively warm year in western Washington. Ripe grapefruit, mint jelly and a bit of cotton candy combine to craft a pleasant quaffing wine."
Lookout Point,Red Blend,90.0,24.0,1,"A soft, nicely oaked Merlot with flavors of baked plum and ripe blackberry. Full-bodied in every sense of the word, with just a sprinkling of spice on the finish."
Lorenzi Estate,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.5,48.5,2,"This is three fifths Merlot, the rest spread among the other four Bordeaux grapes. It's very well crafted, showing a bit of herb along with berries and spice. What most impresses is the overall structure, and the impression of ageworthy muscle in the finish."
Lorenzi Estate,Cabernet Franc-Merlot,85.0,38.0,1,"A signature wine for this winery, it's elegant in style with notes of cocoa, cherry, herbs and nut oil. The palate is light, soft and silky in feel with tart acids bringing the fruit flavors into vivid focus."
Lorenzi Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.33,56.33,3,"An aromatically brooding wine with notes of cherry, black pepper and barrel spices. It's full bodied with rich flavors and a cranberry lick on the finish."
Lorenzi Estate,Chardonnay,87.67,38.33,3,"This is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon blended with 16% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc. It shows a nice interplay of fruit and barrel with notes of cocoa, cherry, dry chocolate and toast supported by well-integrated tannins. The mid-palate still needs some time to fully come together but when it does, it will be a beauty."
Lorenzi Estate,Grenache,88.0,36.0,3,"Off dry it is, with flavors of Meyer lemon and black tea and plenty of acid. It is a fine value for the price, with density, concentration, purity of fruit and grip. Fruit runs through citrus into light tropical; the sugar falls out in the very finish but is balanced nicely against the acids."
Lorenzi Estate,Petite Sirah,88.0,45.0,2,"Like taking in a fresh bouquet of flowers just in bloom, this deliciously crafted Moscato Frivolo, slightly fizzy and superlatively refreshing, is a lovely surprise at just 7% alcohol and $16. Start your night off with a glass or let it guide you through a meal, serve cold and take in its candied orange and jasmine amidst the bubbles."
Lorenzi Estate,Red Blend,89.2,58.6,10,"A deep mauve in color, so much it could be mistaken for a light red wine, this wine offers baked cherry, warm plum fruit and a touch of iron on the nose. Cherry and plum skins mesh with ripe raspberries on the palate, which tastes good but is fairly heavy in style for a pink wine."
Lorenzi Estate,Rosé,85.0,20.0,1,"This is a dark and tarry wine, perhaps a tad early for release, showing condensed purple flowers, beef jerky, charcoal and plum peels on the nose. The palate is tart and chewy, with asphalt, sour black fruit and tobacco notes. Wait a year and this may sing much more strongly."
Lorenzi Estate,Syrah,88.25,51.75,4,"From century-old vines, this is a high-octane, smooth, juicy and soft wine, medium- to full-bodied with flavors of dark cherry-berry baked pie and cola spice."
Lorenzi Estate,Zinfandel,88.17,42.67,6,"A mellow, slightly herbal character pervades this plush-feeling and generous-tasting wine. Smelling ripe and fruity it is accented by savory spice aromas, and delivers warm plum and berry flavors."
Loring Wine Company,Chardonnay,91.14,41.14,7,"More of a mauve color than pink, this wine shows strong cherry notes on the nose as well as seared orange rinds and a slightly boozy rum and coconut element. Mashed cherry pulp and grilled red fruit show on the nose."
Loring Wine Company,Dornfelder,91.0,45.0,1,"Sharp acidity leads to defined flavors of green apple and lemon, maybe even as tart as grapefruit, within this medium-bodied wine with a richness of texture."
Loring Wine Company,Mourvèdre,90.0,45.0,1,"Big, hearty fruit flavors and full body without a lot of tannin make this wine appealing and a good match for meaty dishes from carne asada burritos to pot roast. It's probably no coincidence considering the brand name that it has lots of oak flavor, adding vanilla and other spices."
Loring Wine Company,Pinot Noir,91.81,50.38,26,"The lees and peach aromas are quite light considering the variety. The stone-fruit flavors are reserved and pleasant, but the variety seems to get lost."
Lost Blues,Grenache-Syrah,88.0,42.0,1,"This full-bodied Barbera's especially dark, opaque color is difficult to miss, and its aromas are equally intense. It smells like a late harvest wine, and its blackberry jam and cherry compote flavors seem to coat the palate. Although dry, it's ripe to the extreme and structured with moderate tannins."
Lost Blues,Syrah,93.0,42.0,1,"Winemaker Neil Collins spends his time diving into the region's little known, dry-farmed old vines to deliver distinctive and delicate Zinfandels. This one shows wet riverstone scents, with smashed blackberry and lavender. The palate offers tart black plum, peppercorn and tar touches."
Lost Blues,Syrah-Grenache,92.0,42.0,1,"Merlot makes up just over half of this wine, with Cabernet Sauvignon (39%) playing second fiddle and Cabernet Franc and Malbec rounding it out. It's expressive, with aromas of fig, golden raisins, eucalyptus and red fruit, with the aromas seeming slightly dried out. The palate is fruit forward and textured, while still showing restraint and length."
Lost Canyon,Chardonnay,90.0,35.0,1,"Spindrift's reserve bottling does not seem substantially different from its regular 2005 Pinot, except that it extends its flavors through a much longer and smoother finish. Bright red fruit flavors mix raspberry and blueberry with milk chocolate. An impression of spun sugar wraps up the finish."
Lost Canyon,Pinot Noir,89.0,45.0,7,"This lighter, fruit-forward Syrah from Abacela showcases the spicy, peppery side of the grape. These may be younger vines, or simply less ripe than the fruit that went into the other Syrah, but it is still a very attractive wine, with sweet raspberries, black pepper and rock. A fine balance of acid and tannin provides the right structure for near-term drinking."
Lost River,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,26.0,1,"There's a lot to love in this bottling for those who enjoy cooler-climate Syrah. But the tons of cracked black pepper, asphalt and gamy funk meet with enough elderberry and lavender to appeal to others as well. The palate packs a wide array of flavors, from anise to lavender to cracked peppercorn, with savory tar, dried elderberry and even some elderflower showing as well."
Lost River,Red Blend,84.0,26.0,1,"The most easily accessible of J. Lohr's Bordeaux series, this Cabernet Franc-led ode to Saint-Émilion opens with caramel, vanilla and crème de cassis on the lavish nose. There is ample structure on the palate, with medium tannins, but it's soft enough to enjoy now, with rich fudge, clove and chai flavors laid across tasty black fruits."
Lost River,Syrah,86.0,22.0,1,"Elegant aromas of gingerbread spice, baked blueberry, blackberry and vanilla show on the nose of this layered bottling. Flavors are well integrated and presented atop a soft but noticeable structure, thick with lavender, beef, black currant and allspice on the finish."
Lost River,White Blend,88.0,16.0,1,"Ruben “The Grape Whisperer” Solorzano leaves the vineyard to try his hand in the cellar, and the results are magical. Deep rose and fresh lilac aromas make for an extreme florality, followed by blackberry and black-plum scents. Purple flowers also show on the palate, where a nice sizzle of acidity unleashes candied grape flavors and a spicy pepper element."
Loubud,Pinot Noir,90.0,25.0,1,"This is an extracted and dark style of Cab, showing tar, black pepper, espresso, deep purple fruit and loam on the nose. Baked black plum, elderberry and blackberry fruits show strongly on the palate, which is made deliciously complex by mocha, coffee syrup and cracked pepper accents. Mouthcoating tannins ensure a long cellar life; it should cellar well through 2034."
Louis M. Martini,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.17,105.83,6,"This small-production wine is dense in currant and licorice tones, both generous and lengthy on the palate. Firm tannins lend solid structure, with ample acidity to balance. A clove flavor adds depth to the fruit and lingers on the enduiring finish."
Louis M. Martini,Malbec,90.0,60.0,1,"Lovely white-flower aromas of lily, tuberose and plumeria are elegant and engaging without being overpowering. These pair nicely with the light mango, crushed sea shell and petrol touch of the nose. Coconut, both dried flakes and milk, shows strongly on the creamy sip, along with honeysuckle, pineapple and fragrant white fruit."
Louis M. Martini,Meritage,91.0,65.0,1,"This wine is both incredibly pretty and wild, a tenacious quality of feral forest and ocean at its core. Honeysuckle and rose provide the beauty first, followed by a depth of gorgeous cherry, strawberry and rhubarb, the fruit alive and fresh atop a gravelly texture of complexity."
Louis M. Martini,Red Blend,86.0,65.0,1,"This is a rustic red that smells dusty and sun-baked, tastes earthy, well-aged and dry, and has moderate tannins and acidity."
Louis M. Martini,Zinfandel,89.33,55.0,3,"Aromas of wilted white flowers and ground herbs are followed by off-dry drinking fruit flavors, with peanut shell notes on the finish."
Louis Pommery,Sparkling Blend,90.0,22.0,1,"The highly sought-after, perennially beautiful and brawny Hillside Select is 100% estate grown and 100% varietal. It wows after three years in barrel, painting a lush picture of tobacco, tea and firm, integrated tannin dusted in smoky clove scents. Intensely peppery, its youthful blackberry and cherry flavors shine through but will benefit from even more time in bottle, through 2032."
Love & Squalor,Pinot Noir,90.0,47.2,5,"A testament to the power of Paso Robles' wines, this blend of 37% Grenache, 34% Mourvèdre and 29% Syrah is dense, dark and viscous, showing candied blackberry, crème de cassis and pressed violet aromas, accented with cola and mocha notes. Soft, lush tannins massage the palate, growing grippier with time, while boisterous acidity releases blackberry, espresso and crushed slate flavors. Immensely likable now, it will also last for years."
Love & Squalor,Riesling,90.0,28.33,3,"This is made in tiny amounts, which is heartbreakingly sad given its deliciousness and provenance, the grapes hailing from the Rochioli Sweetwater site on Westside Road. Spice box and sweet black-cherry flavors are lightly oaked and layered with velvety texture, the wine full-bodied and totally balanced."
Love That Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,36.0,1,"Lots of mushrooms in the nose, giving it a lively, gamy, forest floor quality. The fruit is there as well, wild berries and cherries, and the finish lingers through layers of complex, interesting flavors."
Love That Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,50.0,1,"Big, ripe, chocolaty wine, with lots of forward, smooth, oaky flavors. Easy to like, with a plush, creamy mouthfeel, and tons of new oak flavor."
Love That Red,Rosé,86.0,18.0,1,"Old vines from Russian River and Alexander valleys go into this spicy, briary, gamy Zin. There's a dark undercurrent of tar, pipe tobacco and smoke that runs through the finish. The fruit is subsumed to clove and tobacco flavors; best with strongly spiced grilled foods."
Love That Red,Syrah,89.5,37.25,4,"Some of Seghesio's plantings are over a century old, and the wine has a classic, briary quality to it. Supple and inviting, it drinks well now but has the balance and structure to age for a few years."
Lowden Hills,Red Blend,90.0,36.0,1,"High toned, alcoholic nose, with cherry nail-polish scents. Cherries and plums fill the mouth, along with tongue-lashing tannins. The blend includes 6% Grenache and 4% Mourvèdre, which gives it a nice, peppery edge. Lots of flavor for this price."
Lucas & Lewellen,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,39.0,8,"This Napa producer based in the Chiles Valley has made a big style of Cab here, with plenty of tannins and black currant aromas and flavor but the wine's acidity tastes a touch out of balance and could improve with time. Producer recommends waiting to open until 2013."
Lucas & Lewellen,Chardonnay,89.5,18.5,2,"Sharp scents of saddle leather lead into a tannic, earthy wine that remains stubbornly closed even after some hours."
Lucas & Lewellen,Malbec,89.0,29.0,1,"This biodynamic Rhône blend is equal parts of Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier, co-fermented with native yeast. It's a splendid example of the non-interventionist style, rich, and textural. The yeasty flavors are refreshing—pear and apple and cucumber fruit holding down the center—clean and solid. The wine gains power and brings in some toasty barrel flavors as it rolls into the finish."
Lucas & Lewellen,Merlot,89.0,58.0,2,"There's a delicate lemon scent, leading into a mix of citrus, grapefruit peel and honeysuckle. The wine gains weight in the mouth, showing ripe fruit (yellow apples) and a soft, lightly oxidized finish with toasted coconut and cracker. Quite delicious, distinctive and rich."
Lucas & Lewellen,Pinot Noir,89.43,24.57,7,"Vista Hills is in a sweet spot in the Dundee Hills, with neighbors including DDO and Domaine Serene. This puts the fruit front and center, a panoply of berries and melon, lightly edged with toast. Warm, forward and palate-friendly, it rolls into a finish with a hint of sassafras."
Lucas & Lewellen,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,18.0,1,"Nice black cherry and black currant fruit flavors are wrapped in a casing of stone and earth. This wine seems to be holding itself back, perhaps just in need of further cellaring, certainly requiring decanting. It's compact, elegant and well balanced, but shy. A pleasing streak of truffle elevates the finish."
Lucas & Lewellen,Sparkling Blend,88.0,30.0,2,"Light and aromatic, this delicate and poised wine seduces with lush aromas of cherries and baking spices. It has the elegance that only fine Pinot Noir can express. Here the subtleties have been coaxed into rich expression, with details of spice and incense and chocolate truffles adding to the lingering finish."
Lucas & Lewellen,Syrah,88.0,26.0,1,"Very dark-purple fruit meet with crushed black rocks, dense purple flowers and roasted beef on the nose of this lush and delicious bottling, which is bolstered by bits of Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec. Soft black cherry, caramel and vanilla flavors coat the palate, with slate, cocoa, espresso bean and graham cracker touches."
Lucas Vineyards,Cabernet Franc,85.0,18.0,1,"Blue and red fruit wrap around ample, tangy acidity in this medium-bodied, velvety textured wine, so classically styled for the appellation. Pomegranate, rhubarb and floral rose are all highlighted along its gradual evolution in the glass."
Lucas Vineyards,Riesling,85.5,10.0,2,"Fresh raspberry sorbet aromas meet with an herbal edge of pine oil, eucalyptus leaf, green peppercorn and dark sandalwood on the very compelling nose of this bottling by Edgar Torres. It's extremely lively on the palate, light in body but heavy in acid and tannic structure, with wild thyme, mint and sage decorating the mellow red-fruit flavors."
Lucas Vineyards,White Blend,83.0,9.0,1,"Ian Brand is a student of old vines, and it shows in this bottling from a century-old vineyard about 20 minutes south of San Jose. Rose petals, potpourri, dried strawberry and hibiscus-laced rooibos tea aromas transport one back to an old perfumery shop. Then the palate combines the woody tea spices with tart red berries, tarragon and dewy herbs. Fascinating stuff."
Lucia,Syrah,93.0,50.0,1,"Blackberry syrup, vanilla, mocha and a flash of mint are cut by a rocky edge on the nose of this blend of 58% Tempranillo, 21% Grenache and 21% Malbec. Extremely soft and welcoming tannins meet with solid acidity on the palate, where rich black fruit, hoisin sauce and Chinese five-spice flavors arise."
Lucie,Chardonnay,93.5,50.0,2,"Headlining a most impressive debut lineup from this new boutique is this two-barrel reserve. Sourced from the Two Blondes (Andrew Will) vineyard, it's a thick and dense and delicious wine, packed with black cherry, chocolate and espresso. It belongs in the top ranks of all Washington Cab Francs. Yes, the alcohol is up there, but the smooth power of this wine more than justifies it."
Lucie,Pinot Noir,92.33,60.0,6,"Deep blackberry fruit and salt-and-pepper spice is brushed with warm washes of clove, cardamom and dried ginger on the savory nose of this bottling named after Ruben “The Grape Whisperer” Solorzano. The palate starts with a burnt coffee touch, set against fine-grained tannins that are structural but soft, and then come cassis, cola spice and black-cherry-liqueur flavors."
Lucienne,Chardonnay,90.33,40.83,6,"Spectacular aromas of sea salt, dried lemon peels, seared mandarins, chamomile, lemongrass, kaffir lime and plumeria make the mouth water simply upon smelling this savory wine. The sip is loaded with tension and judicious acidity, and yet the flavors are soft, from lemon meringue to crisp pluot and vanilla dust."
Lucienne,Pinot Noir,92.13,50.0,15,"Tart cranberry, orange peel, cinnamon stick, rose petals and mulling spices show on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard by longtime regional winemaker Jeff Fink. It's invigorating on the palate, where ripe strawberry meets with rose hips and eucalyptus oil, proving mellow and subtle in structure yet engaging on all flavor fronts."
Lucky,Red Blend,84.0,24.0,1,"This is a very strong showing for a brand new brand, thanks, no doubt, to veteran winemaker Jeff Fink's involvement. Tight on the nose with Meyer lemon pith, savory salts and a waft of oak smoke, the palate explodes with chalky tension and rich yet bright complexity. Flavors of white lily, peach and sea salt ride atop melted butter, leading into a caramelized finish."
Lujon,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.5,25.0,2,"This blend of 44% Malbec, 33% Petit Verdot and 23% Cabernet Franc shows lots of meaty notes on the nose, including both the charred edges and raw center of a prime rib slice, alongside blueberry and cedar oil. The blueberry core holds strong into the sip, where finely chiseled tannins provide a chalky mouthfeel and carry more flavors of black olive and charred wood."
Lujon,Syrah,88.0,25.0,1,"Soft and layered, this perennially impressive vineyard-designate speaks highly of the variety, showing balanced offerings of plum, dark cherry, leather and spice. A smoky oak  character lies beneath the fruit, complementing it well, while an expansive tannic presence supports the wine's overall breadth and depth. Big boned, this is built to age yet entirely enjoyable now."
Luke Donald,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,42.0,1,"This red comes from one of the appellation's most important vineyards. Immense amounts of black peppercorn and raw beef show on the nose of this awesome bottling, which also offers soy-crusted meats that are gamy but not harsh. Rosemary oil, pine needle and peppercorns decorate the palate. It has a meaty lamb-roast richness at its core."
Luke Donald,Red Blend,91.0,42.0,1,"Pungent aromas of tight-grained oak meet with almonds, pecans and lemon sorbet on the opulent attention-grabbing nose. Woody flavors of sandalwood and cedar continue to the palate, which is crisp, clean and salty but not unctuous at all, with tangy citrus on the finish."
Lullaby,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,45.0,1,"Exuberant in mousse, this wine is luxurious and rich, the perfect quaff for any occasion. Made from 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay, and aged for three years, it's bright in bolts of green apple and strawberry."
Lullaby,Red Blend,91.0,35.0,1,"This varietal wine is toasty in caramelized oak and richly interwoven with flavors and aromas of pencil shavings, plum and black currant. Grippy, with a velvety texture, it provides structure and power in equal parts."
Lullaby,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,22.0,1,"From older vines planted on the producer's estate Quail Hill Vineyard, this wine is thickly concentrated, with a generosity of oak. Creamy, intense and well made, it features complex layers of golden apple, butter and lemon bar."
Lumen,Chardonnay,91.0,30.0,1,"This is a highly perfumed and floral wine from the famous site, which is tangy and slightly tart within a medium-bodied frame. Lemon and baked apple play off each other with ease, as a metallic edge of stony minerality persists and expands."
Lumen,Pinot Noir,90.0,49.0,1,"This is an estate-grown wine from a vineyard planted to three clones. It has an air of forested truffle, pine and cinnamon within a stemmy and somewhat unresolved body of medium weight."
Lumos,Chardonnay,88.0,35.0,1,"Fairly simple blackberry, olallieberry and strawberry fruits meet with just a touch of dried herbs and black spice on the nose of this bottling. It's very juicy on the sip, with more ollalieberry fruit."
Lumos,Gewürztraminer,88.67,19.0,3,"Crisp and clean lines of tart apricot, nectarine, Gala apple and honeysuckle ride a steely frame that characterizes the nose of this wine. Minerality shows first on the sip, but then the wine becomes ripe with apple, pear and peach flavors. A green-apple-rind tartness arises on the finish."
Lumos,Pinot Gris,88.86,18.71,7,"Tons of sagebrush, dried thyme and chaparral scrub enliven the dark mulberry fruit on the earthy nose of this bottling. It's a hearty mouthful of wine once sipped, with more sagebrush, clove and garrigue elements adding complexity to the juicy black fruits. There's quite an aromatic mintiness to the palate."
Lumos,Pinot Noir,87.78,30.33,9,"This wine comes from a select lot from Boushey Vineyard. Reserved aromas of mineral, funk and dark fruit are followed by taught, layered cranberry and cherry that show precision and deftness."
Lumos,Rosé,88.0,22.0,2,"Relatively light tones of vanilla, cranberry, tart plum skin and dried fennel combine for a nicely tight nose on this clonal study. The palate is also quite tart and focused on cranberry and pomegranate, with underlying vanilla richness."
Luna,Chardonnay,92.0,48.0,1,"Crisp black-plum aromas are lifted by lavender, lilac and potpourri scents on the nose of this blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon and 35% Syrah. Lavish flavors of boysenberry pie, vanilla, nutmeg and pastry dough show on the layered palate. It furnishes another strong case for why these two grapes work well together."
Luna,Pinot Grigio,91.5,39.0,2,"This mix of mostly Zin with 14% Petite Sirah from a longtime source for this producer shows plenty of minerality around flavors of cinnamon stick, dark cherry and leather. Soft tannins give it approachability and juiciness that are buoyed by length."
Luna,Red Blend,88.0,60.0,1,"Blackberries, anise, violets, lilacs, plum skin and vanilla show on the nose of this bottling. The palate shows lots of crushed peppercorns, tart elderberry and boysenberry fruit, and then a complex herbal array of tarragon, dried mint and bay leaf."
Luna,Rosé,90.0,32.0,2,"This captures attention with piercing cherry and cranberry aromas and with herb and orange-peel grace notes. The palate is soft, polished and layered, with a mouthfeel that dazzles and the flavors to back it up. The finish lingers."
Luna,Sparkling Blend,87.0,42.0,1,"A blend of Syrah (80%), Cabernet Sauvignon (14%) and Mourvèdre, this opens with aromas of wet gravel, herb, smoke, funk, nori and black olive that are followed by plentiful, soft, generous savory flavors that bring a lot of intensity and appeal. The finish lingers."
Luna Hart,Cabernet Franc,91.0,35.0,1,"Young and yeasty, this seemingly off-dry Viognier rounds out in the mouth with appealing scents and flavors of lemon, lime, jasmine and honey."
Luna Hart,White Blend,90.0,20.0,1,"Rich and full bodied, despite the relatively low alcohol, this supertart and luscious Riesling is loaded with sour candy flavors of lemon and lime. Quite refreshing, pure and dry."
Lundeen,Chardonnay,90.0,29.0,2,"Black and thick, this Petite Sirah delivers on all the variety's attributes in warm-climate California. It's blisteringly gregarious yet rounded, with smoky dark-fruit flavors that are initially hard to capture and tannins that verge on puckering. But time rewards—this wine hits its stride after being allowed to open and swirled around a few times. Enjoy it with a rich risotto or rack of ribs."
Lundeen,Pinot Noir,88.86,37.14,7,"A similar but bigger version of the Whistle Stop Red, this is made of all Cabernet, bearing rather hard tannins and flavors of coffee and clean earth. It's a good choice to pair with grilled cuts of beef."
Lundeen,Riesling,90.0,24.0,1,"Almost black in color, this is a blend of 85% Petite Sirah, 15% Petit Verdot with a pronounced smell and taste of smoked bacon, even smoked gouda, a huge-in-the-mouth wine that's got nothing petite (or petit) about it. Its lingering tannic smokiness begs for barbecue, smoked trout or such. The label is awesome."
Lundeen,Sparkling Blend,90.5,39.5,2,"Pretty dark, almost plum-like in color, this is a blend of 76% Grenache and 25% Syrah from an estate-grown vineyard in the Foothills. Lots of watermelon in aroma and flavor, the wine finishes slightly sweet, reminiscent of a Shirley Temple."
Lusso Della Terra,Chardonnay,91.67,27.67,3,"A good deal for a dry rosé that's almost red like a light Pinot Noir. Very low in alcohol at 12.5%, it's light throughout with layers of peach and grenadine."
Lusso Della Terra,Merlot,90.0,28.0,1,"A Livermore Valley sourcing a Portuguese red grape variety from a Lodi vineyard. Does it work? The wine's dark purple yet subdued at first in flavor, opening slightly into tones of blueberry, raspberry and sour cherry, a smidgen of spice on the finish. Worth trying."
Lutum,Chardonnay,92.17,50.0,6,"This five grape Bordeaux-style blend has a sharp, spicy aroma, a strong suggestion of clove. The fruit is quite light and tastes of strawberries, but quickly is overtaken by the tannins and the barrel flavors. Drink soon."
Lutum,Pinot Noir,91.83,56.67,6,"This wine offers a pleasing mixture of aromas and flavors of baking spices, pear and apple. Viscosity and weight gives it a sense of gravitas but never gets bogged down."
Lyeth,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,30.0,2,"Cold Creek Vineyard provides the majority of the fruit for this wine, with the rest coming from the Wahluke Slope. It's immediate in its appeal with aromas of cocoa, dark chocolate and black fruit. The coffee flavors show a mixture of fruit and barrel, with some graininess to the tannins."
Lynch Wines,Red Blend,91.0,25.0,1,"Coming all from the winery's young estate vineyard, this wine displays aromas of dried herbs, bittersweet chocolate, barrel spices and dried cherries. The black-fruit flavors are sweet and rich, backed by a firm scaffolding of tannins."
Lynch Wines,Syrah,91.5,23.0,2,"Initially tight in the nose with lemon blossoms, Japanese pear and an intriguing vinaigrette character, this is an expertly restrained wine from a longtime growing family. It's crisp and clean at first sip, then opens toward apple blossoms, lime, tangerine juice and a sea -salt warmth."
Lynmar,Chardonnay,93.46,58.75,24,"Fresh and approachable but lean and focused on the nose, this wine shows chalk, wet slate, iodine and mandarin orange oil aromas. It's extremely limey and quinine-driven on the tangy palate, with the judicious acidity of squeezed lime and tangerine juice."
Lynmar,Pinot Noir,93.3,67.88,40,"Very high-toned for a relatively affordable wine, this shows Key lime pith, Greek yogurt, scratched pink grapefruit skin and a fresh 7-Up soda liveliness on the nose. Anjou peas, seared green apples, lime zest and nectarine power the pleasant energy on the palate, which wipes up clean with a vanilla finish."
M. Cosentino,Zinfandel,85.0,22.0,1,"A bright, floral violet bouquet invites in this blend of Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petite Sirah that follows through with earthy cherry and strawberry highlights. Softly textured, the wine is deeply structured and in balance, a delicious offering of several varieties married well."
M2,Red Blend,91.0,24.0,1,"A fascinating wine from one of the oldest wineries in the Sierra Foothills, this has deep boysenberry and blackberry aromas. Flavors include allspice, cardamom and black cherries, with a meaty nuance. Medium to full bodied, it's not a monster Zin but distinctive and clearly delicious."
M2,Syrah,91.0,45.0,1,"This signature blend combines a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It takes a classical approach to the Bordeaux-inspired blend, capturing dried herb and peppercorn in abundance. The wild bouquet delves into floral, feral elements of forest and concentrated cassis, finishing lean."
M2,White Blend,91.0,28.0,1,"This wine is polished in texture, sophisticated in flavor and a pleasure to sip. It exudes plum and blackberry aromas, adds rich plummy flavors and almost coats the mouth with richness. While full bodied, it has enough complexity and finesse for special occasions."
M2,Zinfandel,87.33,33.33,3,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over two-thirds of this wine with the balance Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Dried herb, black cherry, licorice and spice aromas lead to full-feeling dark fruit flavors that show intensity and persistence."
MCV,Petite Sirah,91.33,48.67,3,"Rich and ripe, this has a plushness of red currant and cassis counterbalanced by blackberry on the underbelly. A well-hewn texture leans leathery, with seasonings of black pepper giving it a piquant and lengthy finish."
MCV,Red Blend,89.0,47.0,4,"Stemmy in earthy pine and clove-like spice, this is a powerfully dense and delicious wine. It's on the higher side in terms of alcohol, though doesn't reflect it in bouquet or taste. Savory dark berry wraps itself around mushroomy truffles and black tea to linger on the tongue through a lengthy, weighty finish."
MCV,Rosé,86.0,18.0,1,"The producer's most popular and widely made Zin has a loyal following, and this vintage merits further admiration, offering soft, plummy juiciness on the palate. Not over-oaked, it sparks with black pepper, finishing with elegance."
MCV,White Blend,88.0,30.0,1,"From an historic site replanted and restored to new heights, this wine has good grip and high-octane fruit that plays on the palate, veering from jammy to juicy and back again. Anise and black pepper linger on the lengthy finish, with a touch of smoky oak and toffee."
MICA Cellars,Cabernet Franc,87.0,30.0,1,"Chocolaty, this fun blend of 56% Zinfandel, 31% Petite Sirah, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Petit Verdot hails from estate, dry-farmed vineyards. Big, mountainous tannins soften in the glass to reveal juicy notes of dark and red cherry."
MICA Cellars,Pinot Noir,86.0,30.0,1,"The caramel oakiness of this wine is offset by austere structure and a focused midpalate, the flavors leaning toward cool-climate green apple and kumquat. It returns to richness and intensity on the finish."
MICA Cellars,Red Blend,84.0,30.0,1,"This bottling is ripe and tropical but approachable on the nose, with honeydew melon, banana and nectarine aromas. There is a decent punch of acidity and noticeable texture upon first sip, veering toward sweet apple and bubblegum flavors on the finish."
MacLaren,Pinot Noir,88.0,60.0,1,"Spicy oak nuances and maturity give this full-bodied wine a broad range of peppery, leathery, cedary aromas and mellow flavors reminiscent of milk chocolate and tamarind. It's rustic but fun to taste."
MacLaren,Sauvignon Blanc,91.25,27.75,4,"Brambly and herbal, this wine shows bright acidity underlying a full-bodied, incoherently ripe palate of tar, toffee and rich cola notes."
MacLaren,Syrah,91.23,42.15,13,"Dried apple and caramel scents lead the nose of this wine, building toward a bigger presence of tannin and oak and meeting a stony acidity and sour lemon tartness along the way."
MacLeod,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,26.0,2,Strong aromas and flavors of vanilla and dill overwhelm the variety's cherry and green herb. There are some good things going on but the wood gets in the way.
MacLeod,Zinfandel,91.0,30.0,1,"This is a soft, simple white marked by green olive and vanilla bean flavors that feel concentrated and full on the finish."
MacMurray Estate Vineyards,Pinot Noir,89.75,45.0,8,"This 100% varietal wine is aged in American oak, offering an approachable, rounded, full-bodied impression of pencil shavings, cherry, leather and tobacco bound by firm tannins."
MacMurray Ranch,Pinot Noir,90.0,30.0,2,"This mountain-grown wine is hugely tannic and oaky, hard to penetrate in its full-bodied ripeness. Smoky oak and currant flavors vie for attention against a backdrop of concentration and power."
MacPhail,Chardonnay,91.25,50.0,8,"Extremely buttery in both aroma and flavor, this wine feels smooth and creamy on the palate due to its full body and soft acidity."
MacPhail,Pinot Noir,90.26,55.87,23,"Fans of stickies may find pleasure in this bottling, but it is tremendously sweet and oily. Candied honeydew and kiwi scents meet with sweet juniper and pine on the nose. On the palate, it tastes squarely of golden honey. It's soft, unctuous and thick in consistency."
MacRostie,Chardonnay,90.5,45.0,10,"Made from free-run juice, this offers aromas of dried cherries, dessicated watermelon and clove. Plummy fruits and sour cherry show on the palate."
MacRostie,Pinot Noir,90.89,55.78,9,"Powerful, dark syrupy flavors and strong salt and pepper spices vie for attention in this full-bodied wine. It has heady fruit aromas, savory, spicy accents and a lingering finish."
Macari,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,82.0,43.0,1,"Aged in new French oak for 17 months, this wine tilts heavily toward wood flavors. It has toasted oak aromas plus rich and almost sweet fruit and chocolate flavors accented by black pepper and smoked bacon. Very oaky, it has a tannic texture and smoky finish."
Macari,Cabernet Franc,80.0,19.0,1,"There's a bittersweet tartness to the tannin profile within this wine that is otherwise dusted in cedar, dried herb and black currant. With a big, full-bodied presence of oak, it shows ripe and robust fruit character and plenty of bite."
Macari,Cabernet Merlot,84.0,15.0,1,"Meant to reflect the three elements of terroir, nature and man, this small-production wine is well represented in compost, dried herb, mild tannin and oak. The acidity is moderate and in some ways disjointed, while the finish features highlights of vanilla and currant."
Macari,Chardonnay,84.2,19.4,5,"This wine is made from 50% Sémillon, 29% Sauvignon Blanc and 21% Sauvignon Blanc Musqué clone, the fruit sourced from both the Monte Rosso and Leveroni vineyards. It's fleshy and full of fig flavor, laced in mild lemon, quince and oaky vanilla."
Macari,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,27.0,1,"This wine has just enough residual sugar to take it to the upper threshhold of dry. It's quite full flavored with a thirst quenching mix of citrus, apple and pineapple. Crisp acidity enhances the freshness and contributes a tangy, lemony kick to the finish."
Macauley,Cabernet Sauvignon,96.0,162.5,2,"This wine delivers in flavor and aroma, a refined layering of cherry and strawberry that celebrates what this aromatic clone can do in Russian River Valley. Orange peel and tart, tight acidity combine around a silky texture, with a ginger-spice finish and lingering hint of rose petal."
Macauley,Zinfandel,91.0,45.0,1,"The producer has chosen to highlight the Petaluma Gap region within the larger Sonoma Coast appellation on this wine, a nod to its recent purchase of the well-regarded Sun Chase Vineyard as well as an endorsement of the Gap becoming an appellation of its own one day. This Pinot might help matters, a beautifully floral mix of rose petal and violet on the nose followed intricately by juicy, subtle red fruit and buoyant acidity."
Macchia,Barbera,86.0,22.0,1,"Interplanted to Carignane, Alicante Bouschet and Grand Noir, this Zin vineyard hails back to 1895, a grande dame in the region, and is farmed by Ulises Valdez. The meticulous farming and winemaking are in full view, the wine velvety in blueberry and boysenberry fruit, while well-honed tannins and a full body announce its presence. On the finish is a satisfying streak of black licorice and pepper. Cellar through 2022."
Macchia,Petite Sirah,87.0,24.0,2,"There's a velvety silkiness to this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon as well as a lushness to the palate that will please aficionados of both Cabernet and Pinot Noir. Refined tannins stand out in subtle ways, as do high-toned cassis and blackberry. Though the wine displays a richness of oak and chocolate, the minerality truly shines here. This will cellar well through 2025."
Macchia,Primitivo,91.0,24.0,1,"In 2007 the excellent Celilo vineyard serves up a stunning Gewürztraminer. The brilliantly displayed floral, citrus and mineral scents lead into a soft, rich and thoroughly delicious wine with layers of green berry, citrus, melon and mineral, along with refreshing acids and a streak of toasty hazelnut."
Macchia,Zinfandel,87.0,32.5,2,"Still spritzy, very tart and tangy, with orange peel and lemon drop flavors. Perhaps showing just a bit more intensity than the 2006, this is a terrific follow-up with the same mix of delicacy and power that suggests that the Columbia Gorge AVA may well be the best site in the Pacific Northwest to grow Riesling."
Machine Breaker,Pinot Noir,88.0,23.0,1,"This single vineyard in the Dundee Hills recalls Oregon Pinots from days gone by. It's not too big, not too oaky, plenty ripe and delivers spicy berry fruit along with earthier streaks of leaf, herb, baking spices and a whiff of cinnamon. Stiff acids and earthy tannins betray its youth, but though still a little rough around the edges, this could be cellared for a decade or more."
Mackey Vineyards,Riesling,90.0,15.0,1,"This blend mixes the estate fruit with several different vineyards, making a more fruit-forward, accessible wine than the single-vineyard offerings. Flavors show bright raspberry and tart cranberry, leading to some tangy acids, backed with earth, rock and hints of caramel. The new oak is gently applied, adding to the finish without taking away the wine's naturally juicy fruit."
Madrigal,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.33,63.33,3,"A lovely counterpoint to Phelps Creek's estate reserve Chardonnay, this comes from just across the river, sourced from a vineyard on the Washington side of this two-state AVA. It got the full malolactic, fermented in French oak treatment, and shows plenty of pleasing barrel toast and spice. The fruit mixes hints of peach and melon with a lemon drop core, and finishes with a lick of butterscotch."
Madrigal,Cabernet Franc,91.0,70.0,1,"Fresh and satisfying, with flavors of apples and pears, brioche and vanilla cream. What stands out is the full, round midpalate, and the way the wine keeps resonating through an extended finish."
Madrigal,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,125.0,2,"Succulent in red cherry and cassis, this wine has a surprising level of depth and grip. It finds its way with integrated tannins, soft layers of caramelized oak and a brightness of fruit and acidity."
Madrigal,Petite Sirah,86.0,65.0,1,"Mouthcoating, this is a full-bodied wine with small amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Tar, leather, cedar and black cherry stand out as characteristics, with added weight from the heavier, darker elements of chocolate and oak. Drink now through 2022."
Madrigal,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,30.0,1,"Wild berries, from elderberry to salmonberry to mountain strawberries, are in play in this wine. The underpinning scents suggest earth and wet cement, while in the finish a strong flavor of breakfast tea lingers. This is an interesting addition to the Sineann lineup."
Madrigal,Tempranillo,88.0,45.0,1,"This falls sbetween a rosé and an orange wine in its appearance, a pale salmon/copper shade that results from 36 hours of skin contact before pressing. Scents of hibiscus tea and rosewater put a delicate top note ahead of rich, ripe, round and spicy citrus fruit. A strong impression of cinnamon marks the finish."
Madroña,Riesling,86.0,18.0,2,"Clean, crisp and bright, this was fermented in stainless (with just 10% in neutral wood), and not put through malolactic. The blend is 60/40 Chardonnay/Pinot Noir, yielding fresh fruit flavors of apple and melon that are focused and precise. A streak of ginger runs through racy acidity."
Madroña,Zinfandel,87.0,18.0,1,"Stainless-steel fermented, this wine remains pungently aromatic in woody, earthy tones, with accents of fragrant orange blossom and pear, while staying crisp and light on the palate. Honey and lemon combine on the complex finish."
Maggio,Zinfandel,86.0,9.0,1,"Root beer, cola nut, black cherry, black raspberry and anise seed combine for an exciting nose on this bottling from a winery near Morgan Hill. The mouthfeel is full, with graphite and lively fennel-bulb spice mixing with blackberry fruit and an earthy elegance on the pleasing palate."
Magistrate,Chardonnay,83.0,12.0,1,"This is a floral blend of 48% Roussanne, 35% Marsanne and 17% Viognier. The Roussanne speaks loudest, while the whole offers a mix of dried and fresh apricot and creamy vanilla wafer that's light bodied and fresh with acidity."
Magistrate,Red Blend,88.0,10.0,1,"A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Merlot, this was built to be approachable young. Grapes are sourced from an estate, organically farmed vineyard as well as two neighboring properties, Pickberry and Murray Ranch. Tobacco forms around a juiciness of blackberry and raspberry, giving it a sultry edge, while maintaing soft tannins throughout."
Magna Mater,Sauvignon Blanc,89.5,28.0,2,"It's pure Cabernet Sauvignon, dense, dark and what might be called brooding. Despite the massive fruit, the darker notes of black olive and earth are not submerged in sweetness. In fact, there are Stag's Leap-like flavors of rock and mineral. Along with the sleek cassis and black cherry, come highlights of bitter chocolate."
Magnificent Wine Company,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.33,11.33,3,"This vineyard-designated Sauv Blanc is half fermented in stainless steel, 40% in concrete eggs and the rest in French oak. It is completely different from the winery's Columbia Valley bottling, with much riper and rounder fruit flavors showing off stone fruits, such as peaches and apricots, along with tropical hints of papaya. There's plenty of stuffing and spice, and a perfect mix of the grape's innate herbaceous and grassy qualities, ramped up with riper, sweeter fruit."
Magnificent Wine Company,Chardonnay,86.0,11.0,1,"The Claret is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four Bordeaux grapes filling in the other half, and is quite firm, sappy and muscular. It is tightly structured with cassis, black cherry and plenty of dark, tarry undertones. The herbal aspects show in some black olive and black tea flavors; the tannins are strong and supple, and the wine has a sinuous finish suggesting both strength and length. An exceptional value, this wine should age very nicely."
Magnificent Wine Company,Red Blend,86.67,12.0,3,"Bone dry, earthy and leathery, this Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon seems a bit tired. The fruit is showing early signs of fading, and the tannins—earthy, green and a bit rough—may already be taking over. Some earthy, organic, almost biodynamic flavors come out in the finish."
Mahoney,Chardonnay,90.0,24.0,2,"The Naked Riesling is organically farmed and produced. This new vintage already seems a bit tired and has an unusually deep (oxidized?) golden color. It's drinking well enough, like a somewhat aged apple cider, but does not have the sort of freshness that one would hope for in a just-released 2007 wine."
MaidenStoen,Riesling,90.0,22.0,6,"Occupying the bottom rung (in terms of cost) of the Columbia Crest ladder, Two Vines wines are generally light, quite clean and simple, with a minimum exposure to oak. This fits the mold, with flavors of strawberry chews and cotton candy. The tannins are also light and herbal, with an earthy, pleasantly leafy finish."
Maison Basque,Zinfandel,82.0,24.0,1,"This wine is 67% Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest equal parts Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It's aromatic and fruit-forward, offering red plum, herbs, milk chocolate and floral accents. The fruit flavors are rich and focused, showing great depth and intensity with a palate-coating feel."
Maison Bleue,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,65.0,1,"From 41-year-old vines on just over five estate acres, this is resiny and briny on the nose. A honey-laced creaminess at the core is tensely accentuated by vibrant acidity. Balanced and elegant, with a sunny bite of ripeness, it revels in nuances of fresh and dried apricot while lighter notes of lemon, lime and grapefruit play backup."
Maison Bleue,Chardonnay,90.0,22.5,2,"Consistency of richness and caramel toastiness characterizes this wine year in and year out. This vintage exudes both the full-bodied style embraced by the producer as well as the voluptuously ripe and wholesome fruit that comes off of the vineyard in a year like 2012. Dark gold in color, it offers salty, savory accents around a core of lemon-specked minerality. Surreal and effete, it finishes with flair."
Maison Bleue,Grenache,92.2,36.4,10,"This inaugural release is 100% varietal that's aged in neutral French puncheons. The panoply of notes includes raspberry seed, dark plum, green olive and nori. The mouthfeel is the true star with a rich, pillowy-soft, palate-coating texture showing exceptional purity and an extended finish."
Maison Bleue,Marsanne,90.0,35.0,2,"This wine needs some coaxing at first to come out of its shell. Once settled, it entices in warming cardamom, clove and damp earth, taking on savory airs. Exuberant as it develops, it offers high-toned cherry and tangerine that surround a silky, subtle body. Hints of spicy cinnamon and white pepper mark the finish."
Maison Bleue,Red Blend,90.33,26.67,3,"This standout wine is 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc mostly from old blocks at Dionysus, Red Willow and Bacchus vineyards. It's youthful with aromas of toasty barrel spices, dark roasted coffee and high-toned savory herbs. Flavors are light and restrained while still showing a lot of richness, with the dark fruit notes backed by mouthwatering acids. Just a baby now, this is a 20-year wine that should start to strut its stuff after 2024. Give it a 24-hour decant if opening it in the near term."
Maison Bleue,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.75,37.5,4,"The Sonoma Zinfandel house pursues a rich, opulent Rhône style in this bottling, with aromas of dark red fruit, purple florals, game and wet asphalt. It hits the palate with a Sichuan pepper-like buzz that enlivens the mouth far into the finish, with well-seasoned flavors of dried cherries, fennel and crushed Italian herbs."
Maison Bleue,Rhône-style White Blend,92.0,30.0,1,"Kana's Workingman's Red has turned into a southern Rhône style blend of six grapes, the only outlier being a splash of Tempranillo. Toasty, round and easy-drinking, it's a good, all-purpose barbecue red, with a smoky, espresso-scented finish."
Maison Bleue,Roussanne,94.0,25.0,1,"It opens with sweet/tart raspberry fruit, a streamlined, well-defined wine underscored by tart, citrusy acids. It does not show the harmonious complexity of the blends, but it is a very pleasant wine, soft and approachable, sweet and smooth. A bit one-dimensional; it begins with fresh berry fruit, tosses in a hint of cherry tobacco, and leaves a slightly earthy impression in the finish, but fails to move in the mouth."
Maison Bleue,Syrah,92.33,45.67,6,"Coming from a site best known for its Syrah, this wine brings high-toned aromas of violets, herb and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are rich yet supple, with fine-grained but occasionally toothy tannins providing support. Mocha flavors linger on the finish. It's a bit oak heavy but by and large carries it."
Maison Bleue,Viognier,87.0,23.0,1,"This tart, sleek, pretty wine shows bright strawberry and raspberry fruit. Quite young and fresh, it's still rather tight and stubbornly closed, even after breathing for a full 24 hours."
Maison L'Envoyé,Pinot Noir,87.0,35.0,10,"Made in a big, bold, full-bodied style, this blend is showy in juicy blackberry, cedar and currant, flavors that are surrounded by firm, integrated tannin. A taste of cigar and chocolate gives the end note a nightcap kind of feel."
Maisonry,Chardonnay,91.0,38.0,1,"Ripe, jammy, grapy aromas and flavors and a lush but firm texture make this medium-bodied wine instantly appealing and enjoyable to drink. It has nicely concentrated fruit flavors, a sense of depth and a beautiful, velvety texture."
Maisonry,Marsanne,85.0,38.0,1,"This wine is like an adventurous trek through the mountains, with wild, smoky, forest aromas, gamy, black-peppery flavors and a rugged texture that's inviting. Flavor nuances come out with each sip, yielding blackberry, blueberry and grilled steak."
Maisonry,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,32.0,1,"Deep olallieberry-pie aromas meet with lilac, vanilla and brown sugar on the very accessible nose of this bottling. It's somewhat thin on the palate, but quite grippy and refreshing, with flavors of dried plums, marjoram and lavender."
Maldonado,Pinot Gris,90.0,25.0,1,"This wine moves quickly past its tight red currant fruit into flavors of red licorice, hints of caramel and a rather light, almost airy finish. Crisp and well-made, but a bit ambiguous."
Maldonado,Pinot Noir,91.0,37.0,2,"Erath's Juliard bottling has a bit more stiffness and muscle than the wide-open Hyland, but tails off too quickly to be considered as a cellar candidate. The soft strawberry fruit flavors are wrapped in pleasing chocolate, and lightly spicy, toasty details pop up throughout. It just lacks grips and length."
Maldonado,Syrah,89.0,75.0,2,"This is a hearty wine on the nose, with sarsaparilla, red plum, rustic leather, dried strawberry and clove, showing a touch of age. A wide array of allspice, star anise and chicory spice pops on the palate, surrounded by dried red cherry, leather, iced coffee and turned-earth flavors. The acidity remains vibrant, but drink now."
Maley Brothers Vineyards,Zinfandel,91.0,32.5,2,"Beatrice Cointreau is a 20th generation winemaker who moved to Malibu, where she makes this blend of 98% Viognier and 2% Chardonnay. It shows delicate lemon wedges, ripe nectarine and melon, lime zest and tangerine juice on the nose. The palate combines lime peels with riper peach and pineapple notes in the midpalate."
Malibu Rocky Oaks,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,24.0,2,"A powerful waft of red fruit and tannin combine for an agreeable wine that'll do well across palates, appealing to those who like some weight and body to their wine and to others who like a wine priced under $30. Either way, give it some time to air in the glass: it's still very much a baby."
Malibu Rocky Oaks,Chardonnay,88.0,15.0,1,"A fairly rich take on this grape, which many wineries use from this particular vineyard, this bottling is flush with white peach and white melon aromas, cut by lime and dried lemon blossoms, and layered with intriguing kiwi and exotic citrus notes. The palate is more simple, with apple and lemon flavors and chalky texture."
Malibu Rocky Oaks,Pinot Noir,89.0,26.0,1,"Blueberry paste, chocolate cake and a touch of tar show on the nose of this wine, which clings to its aromas and doesn't let them escape easily. The palate is more showy, with purple flowers and grape candy flavors, framed by rather strong tannins. This will improve with a bit more time."
Mallea,Syrah,89.0,25.0,1,"Equal parts Wallula and Canoe Ridge vineyard fruit, the aromas offer expressive notes of melon, flowers, jasmine and peach. The palate is textured and full, but the flavors at times seem a bit diluted. It shows some heat on the back end."
Maloney,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.33,65.0,3,"Pressed olallieberries, lilacs, a touch of pine smoke and fairly grapy aromas show on this easy-drinking bottling. The palate is straightforward with quaffable grape and olallieberry flavors, with a judicious amount of tannins and acidity to keep it exciting."
Mancan,Sparkling Blend,87.0,5.0,1,"Dark hay in color with a concentration of oak on the nose, the palate retains that richness of nutty almond and apple pie, finding a balance that betrays the heavier implications of the initial aromas. On the finish it offers a lightness of being, as well as a touch of perfume."
Mannina Cellars,Merlot,89.0,24.0,1,"A 100% varietal wine from one vineyard, this wine opens in cinnamon stick and blackberry jam, leading the way to chocolatey leather on the palate offset by tingling acidity. Currant, blueberry and cedar also make appearances atop a full-body and lengthy, concentrated finish."
Mannina Cellars,Red Blend,88.33,17.67,3,"A fruity wine, with tangy cranberry and raspberry flavors. Sharply acidic, with fairly strong tannins, it seems a little tight and thin, but does have the pure fruit and some length in the finish to recommend it."
Mannina Cellars,Sangiovese,87.5,22.0,2,"This Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier blend is named for a cousin gifted in the art of matchmaking. It's a touch sweet, a little closed still, with notes of tar and caramel and the promise of lightly flavored apples and honeysuckle in the body of the wine."
Manross,Pinot Noir,90.0,58.0,1,"Half Malbec, half Petit Verdot (hence Petit Bec), this rough and tumble red has plenty of earthy tannic power. Rustic and sharp, with barely ripe fruit, it is similar to a cru Bordeaux, but with a little more meat on its bones."
Mansfield-Dunne,Pinot Noir,91.5,48.0,2,"This shows the herbal, somewhat stemmy character of Yakima Valley fruit in a cool vintage. It's well made, with good balance, but not quite ripe enough. Leaf and stem and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of tart berry."
Mansion Creek,Cabernet Sauvignon,83.0,24.0,1,"This winery makes just a single, estate-grown Pinot Noir each year. Pomegranate and red plum fruit flavors are gracefully showcased in this elegant vintage. Silky and smooth, it retains focus through a medium-weight, impeccably clean finish."
Manu Propria,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.67,35.0,3,"Pure Malbec from the new estate vineyard, this is forward with sweetly grapy fruit flavors. Aging in 80% new oak adds a streak of espresso and pretty baking spices."
Manzanita Creek,Chardonnay,84.0,28.0,1,"Ripe strawberry compote typifies this appealing wine. The nicely ripened fruit is set in a mineral-driven, high acid frame, and shows both texture and length as it develops in the mouth. It's especially noteworthy given the moderate alcohol."
Manzanita Creek,Syrah,87.0,38.0,1,"Another Fiddletown beauty, this one is pungent in blackberry and exhilarating pepper and clove. Aromatic, structured and electric with equal parts acidity and stony minerality, this wine has a long-lingering finish of gorgeous brambly fruit."
Manzanita Creek,Zinfandel,84.67,32.67,3,"A robust Zin, this wine's lusty, cinnamon-spice aromas carry through on the tongue, while the texture is refined and rich. With balanced alcohol and acidity, its full-figured body is still juicy and bright. Cellar it for a few more years or let it breathe before serving."
Manzoni,Chardonnay,84.0,30.0,1,"Fragrantly floral, it offers ripe red fruit in delicate balance, its tannins softened and the oak imprint kept at a minimum. The vines are thought to be more than 25 years old, the clone and rootstock unknown. An elegant, tightly woven Syrah."
Manzoni,Pinot Noir,89.0,35.2,5,"Within a statement-sized bottle, this heavy, lush and aromatic Pinot Noir from a great vineyard could ignite debates about California Pinot styles. Aged about a year in all French oak, 65% of it new, it reveals an expanse of dark cherry fruit, velvety texture and plenty of structure amidst a leathery core and lengthy finish."
Manzoni,Syrah,85.0,32.0,1,"From old head-trained vines, Contention is McCay's top-of-the-line Westside Lodi Zin, a study in tight, dusty tannins and earthy acidity backed by a substantial layering of baking spices. Let this wine open a while to express itself fully."
Maragas,Pinot Gris,82.0,20.0,1,"A rich, viscous combination of 55% Roussanne, 35% Grenache Blanc and 10% Viognier, this offers a bite of creamy vanilla amidst layered, hearty and concentrated flavors of lemon chiffon. Fermented in oak and stainless steel, it aged for 11 months in French oak, only 28% of it new."
Maragas,Red Blend,86.0,20.0,1,"Winemaker Markus Niggli is making remarkable whites from unusual, hard-to-find grapes, in this case a blend of 50% Kerner, 25% Riesling and 25% Bacchus. This slight, seductive white dances in acidity that's got an electric mouthfeel, with a bouquet of citrus and herbs that you'll be thinking about a long time."
Margerum,Grenache,90.0,21.0,1,"Sanguine in black olive tapenade, this is a soft, smooth, 100% varietal wine that's full-bodied and expressive in black cherry and dark plum. It finishes in tight, chewy tannins."
Margerum,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.75,33.5,4,"Made from Syrah, this is a zesty, dry and medium-bodied wine, soft and thirst-quenching in waves of strawberry and raspberry. Undertones of dried herb and citrus mark the finish."
Margerum,Rhône-style White Blend,92.0,21.0,1,"A direct-pressed wine, this has a pretty copper-pink color. It is intense in cranberry and subtle herbes de Provence, with notions of fresh-cut grass and tart Meyer lemon. Young, it needs time in the glass to reveal its complexity and range of flavor. The finish is dry and succulent on the palate."
Margerum,Rosé,91.0,21.0,1,"Lighter in color, this blend of Pinot Noir, Cabernet Franc and Syrah has aromas and flavors of mesquite smoke, strawberry and cherry, with the Pinot seemingly in the lead. The smoky flavors are medium bodied, with a light grip of chalky tannins."
Margerum,Sauvignon Blanc,90.4,27.0,5,"Aromas of coffee, cocoa, green wood and fresh herbs lead to pleasing cherry, cola and chocolate flavors with abundant vanilla and wood accents, with tannins lending some grip."
Margerum,Syrah,91.62,41.0,8,"Cabernet Sauvignon (66%) takes the lead on this Bordeaux-style blend, followed by Cabernet Franc (16%), Merlot (12%) and Malbec. Aromas of anise, dried herbs, dried cherries and tomato leaf are followed by lighter-styled medicinal flavors that linger."
Marianello,Red Blend,90.0,48.0,1,"Aromas of hazelnut, mineral and pear lead to off-dry, full-feeling fruit flavors that are stitched up with citric acidity on the finish. It doesn't entirely come together but there's plenty to enjoy."
Marianello,White Blend,86.0,28.0,1,"Vanilla, cherry, strawberry and spice on the nose is followed by slightly smokier, bigger flavors on the palate. The wine has a fruity character backed by pepper and spice. Clean and suited for myriad flavors, from seafood salad to grilled lamb."
Marietta Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,31.5,2,"This friendly red blend, made with Cabernet, Steuben and Ives, starts with aromas of allspice, cherry and pepper followed by flavors of fresh, tart red berry and spice. It's a fun and easy-drinking red that will pair well with myriad dishes, from pasta to grilled steaks."
Marietta Cellars,Red Blend,89.25,21.0,4,"A lightly pétillant ice wine. Harvested at almost 38 brix, it is not as dense and racy as the ice wines of British Columbia or eastern Canada, but it offers its own pleasures. Here are details of sweet straw, rice cracker, caramel and honey, nicely interwoven and persistent, and never turning cloying or sugary."
Marietta Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,22.0,1,"This is pure Merlot from 10-year-old vines. Lush and chocolaty, it offers a broad, ripe and appealing set of seamless black fruit flavors. Powerful and high-toned, this adds licorice and mocha to the expansive finish."
Marietta Cellars,Rosé,88.0,14.0,1,"This 58% Cab-42% Syrah blend is almost jet black, bursting with floral aromas, meaty and just slightly pruney, almost like a super Tuscan. Baking spices (brown sugar, allspice) and pepper add still more flavor interest, along with some lightly herbal influence. It's a distinctive, deep and seemingly quick-maturing wine that should be enjoyed now."
Marietta Cellars,Zinfandel,90.5,28.5,2,"The new release from this old (1972) vineyard boosts the alcohol to 13.9%, dropping the residual sugar to just over 1%. Deep, concentrated, and driven by a dense minerality, this exceptional single-vineyard Riesling has raw fruit flavors of green apple, white peach and citrus rind. Sure to evolve, perhaps over decades, it has the vivid acidity and penetrating finish to improve significantly."
Marimar Estate,Albariño,91.25,33.5,4,"The Eyrie reserve is a single vineyard selection from the estate's oldest vines, planted between 1967 and 1973. The longevity of these wines is a proven fact; they evolve (and generally improve) for decades. This is already delicious, smoky, almost ethereal, with truly Burgundian finesse and depth. This wine, as much or more than any other, expresses the potential of Oregon Pinot Noir to approach the majesty of fine Burgundy."
Marimar Estate,Chardonnay,91.17,39.83,12,"Old-vine Oregon Zinfandel is not common; in fact, this is all of them. From the Pines Vineyard, planted around a century ago, revived in the 1980s, these wines have a power and unique presence that sets them apart from Zin from anywhere else. Ultraripe fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, alcohol above 15%, amazing density and beautifully managed tannins, with some sweet grain flavors that say “old vines.”"
Marimar Estate,Pinot Noir,89.1,50.75,20,"This unusual rosé is a cofermentation of 80% Pinot Noir and 20% Pinot Blanc. It's an uneasy compromise, with neither grape really taking the lead. Kind of like one of those awkward wine and food combos where the whole is less than either of its parts. Sour strawberry flavors thin out quickly; that's about it."
Marimar Estate,Syrah,91.0,49.0,1,"This is a serviceable, if nondescript Chardonnay. In a highly competitive category it doesn't stand out in any way. It's just a light expression of apple flavors, with a quick finish that leaves a slight impression of glue."
Marimar Estate,Syrah-Tempranillo,92.0,45.0,1,"Barrel aromas are in the lead here, with notes of sawdust and cedar, along with Band Aid and gamy notes. Dark fruit aromas are in the background. The full-bodied flavors reveal more of the same, showing a lot of heat."
Marimar Estate,Tempranillo,86.0,49.0,2,"Inkblot is Lodi winery Michael David's first Cabernet Franc, a relatively small production wine with MD's signature smoky, toasty coconut aromas, thick and raspberry jammy. Aged 15 months in French oak, it would be a hit with big wine lovers but doesn't exhibit Cab Franc's herbaceousness, which some people will be happy about, others will not. Includes small amounts of Cab Sauvignon and Petite Sirah."
Mario Perelli-Minetti,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,80.0,1,"Tight purple fruit smells of black raspberry meet with violets, crushed slate, dried rose petals, raw beef and black peppercorns on the focused nose. The palate is very slate-driven and rocky, offering turned earth, juniper and more dark raspberry flavors. It is still very tightly wound, and needs more time to unfurl."
Mark David,Sauvignon Blanc,93.0,34.0,1,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with this very affordable, concentrated and trimly built wine. Earth and sage aromas lead to bright black cherry and plum flavors, with a typically firm texture for the varietal."
Mark Ryan,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.69,46.92,13,"Aromas of orange blossoms, scratched apple skins, lemon-lime soda and jasmine waft off of this bottling. The texture is quite grippy, with tactile acidity and a dynamic mouthfeel presenting lime sorbet and sugared apple flavors."
Mark Ryan,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.78,71.11,9,"A slip of sour cherry gives zing to this medium-acidity, fruit-forward wine that's both earthy and pinched in toasted oak."
Mark Ryan,Mourvèdre,91.5,47.0,6,"This is a smooth, soft wine with tasty, mellow fruit flavors, full body and light acidity. It's well-aged and ready to drink."
Mark Ryan,Pinot Noir,91.0,50.0,1,"Lots of ripe berry and pomegranate notes give a fruity profile to this dry, medium-bodied, fresh and lightly tannic wine. It will be a good quaffing wine for lunch or dinner with mushroom pizza or grilled chicken."
Mark Ryan,Red Blend,90.78,38.56,9,"The oak is far out in front, with the aromas of vanilla, dill and freshly hewn wood making it difficult to find the fruit. Cranberry flavors struggle to get to the surface. It's technically well made but the barrel treatment completely overrides any sense of the variety."
Mark Ryan,Syrah,91.62,47.31,13,"Half Sangiovese and one-quarter each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot all coming from the cool 2011 vintage, this is lightly flavored with notes of dried cranberry and sour cherry, backed by firm tannins."
Mark Ryan,Sémillon,90.0,30.0,1,"This lovely wine has a great depth of decadent, succulent aromas of citrus and apple blossom, that explode around tangy acidity. Pear, quince and lemongrass-ginger spice dot the palate in measured, beautiful ways, finishing balanced and crisp."
Market Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.11,29.22,9,"A buttery style, this bottling offers popcorn, sea salt caramel and vanilla cookies on the nose alongside tropical coconut, ripe peach and banana fruit, all judiciously presented. There's an immediate sizzle of acidity to cut through the butter on the palate, where pan-fried apples, squeezed lemons and almonds make for an excellent California Chardonnay."
Market Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.73,42.09,11,"This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (42%), Merlot (30%), Petit Verdot (14%) and Cabernet Franc. Complex aromas of toast, green herbs, fig, citrus, flowers and clove lead to rich but reserved flavors, with the tannins seeming bunched up. Give them time to stretch out. Best after 2020."
Market Vineyards,Malbec,89.0,37.67,3,"Quite dense and slow to release aromas at first, this bottling, which includes 14% Tempranillo and 6% Tannat, eventually gives scarlet red rose petals, lavender, elderberry and a rich touch of maple-laced bacon fat on the nose. It's much more dynamic and delicious once sipped, with blueberry and blackberry jam, smoked lamb, rosemary and more lavender, bound together by grippy tannins."
Market Vineyards,Merlot,90.29,40.57,7,"This is singer/songwriter John Legend's inaugural wine project in conjunction with Raymond Vineyards in the Napa Valley. Combining 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Petit Verdot, it tells a powerful story in thick layers of blackberry cobbler, chocolate and coffee, the tannin and oak integrated and silky smooth. This is a wine of great presence."
Market Vineyards,Rhône-style White Blend,87.0,20.0,1,"A small project by Carr Winery cellarmaster Chris Wright, this 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah is vivacious on the nose with bright pomegranate, nearly effervescent black cherry, iced coffee and inviting fruit punch aromas. There's a sliver of tar to the sip, but mostly suave black and red plum fruit, exotic bergamot tang and Chinese five spice complexity."
Market Vineyards,Syrah,90.0,39.0,2,"From a high-elevation site farmed by the producer, Goat Trek is 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Zinfandel, an unusual comingling of different personalities that manage to get along. A succulence of red currant, raspberry and dried herb complements a crispness of acidity that surprises. Big-bodied, it's also refined and graceful."
Market Vineyards,White Blend,87.67,20.0,3,"Hailing principally from Two Blondes Vineyard, the aromas of cocoa, savory herbs, pencil shavings, anise and spice are followed by fruit flavors so soft and plush you just want to sink into them. The finish lingers. It explores the variety's more savory side."
Markham,Cabernet Franc,88.0,42.0,1,"Though Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc each make up just 3% of this wine, they seem to show themselves aromatically, with herb and floral notes that provide the backdrop for Merlot's cocoa and cherry. The red fruit flavors are plump and juicy, backed by bright acid that leads to a long, fruit filled finish. It doesn't always come off as completely varietal but it's nearly impossible to resist all the same."
Markham,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.75,72.0,4,"Melon, sea salt and white peach aromatics lean into a pomelo pith and wet concrete backbone on this crisp, nearly austere and completely impressive bottling. There is great lime peel and yellow grapefruit tension to the palate, which is linear and acid-driven, and possesses a chalky texture as well as warmer yellow pear flavors."
Markham,Chardonnay,88.0,22.0,1,"From a site planted in 2002, 100% varietal and given time in 50% new French oak, this steal of a deal offers dusty minerality around a thickness of vanilla and cherry pie, finding a way to rein in its concentrated richness before going too far. This is a likable and impressive wine well worth seeking."
Markham,Pinot Noir,85.0,31.0,1,"Apple strudel and lime sorbet met with crisp pear, tart lemon peels and a touch of quinine on the edges of this wine's nose. The palate is incredibly chalky and mineral-driven, with flavors of yellow apple peels and lime skins vying for attention amidst the grippy texture."
Markham,Red Blend,87.5,25.0,2,"This blend is mostly Merlot (86%) along with Cabernet Franc, with the fruit coming from two of the state's top sites, Boushey and Champoux. Initially brooding raspberry compote, graphite and dried herb aromas are followed by supple, tart fruit and coffee flavors that sail on the finish. The balance is impeccable. It charms with its subtleties rather than its power, but make no mistake, it charms."
Markus Wine Co,Gewürztraminer,89.67,21.0,3,"This cuvée saw 20% new oak and is the little sibling to the winery's Barrel Select. It offers the same hint of funk, slightly murky color, and rich, textural makeup. Black cherry, cola, chocolate, bramble and spice are all in play, making for a complex wine that captures your attention."
Markus Wine Co,Rosé,90.0,22.0,2,"The size of this wine distracts slightly from its thick, concentrated dark plum and blackberry brambly quality, the tannins soft and the oak able to stand behind the fruit. A syrupy, leathery and mocha finish seals the deal."
Markus Wine Co,Torrontés,92.0,22.0,1,"This black grape dessert wine is relatively light in color and transparent, offering aromas of dried violet, raspberry concentrate and light clove. The flavors prove bright and memorable, with raspberry and pomegranate juice most apparent. This is a great conversation starter at the end of a meal."
Markus Wine Co,White Blend,89.67,21.67,3,"Thomas Fogarty's Bordeaux project unleashes aromas of black pepper, Bing cherry and cedar in this wine that proves light, airy and vivacious. Flavors of black and sour cherry dominate the acid-driven palate, which picks up more pepper and is quite easy going down."
Marshall Davis,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,36.0,1,"Powerfully brambly this gigantic wine hails from a monumental vineyard that consistently delivers fine-tuned tension between structure and intensity. Sizable tannins surround a soft mouthfeel of plum, leather and black pepper, the concentration suggesting aging through 2020."
Martellotto,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,30.33,3,"Perfumey violet and leather mingle on the nose before a taste of softened cedar, leather pouch and tobacco hit the palate. Robust tannins and oak follow, mellowing over time with air and a swirl or two. Cigar-tinged tobacco revisits on the finish."
Martellotto,Merlot,87.0,29.0,2,"Aromas are wintery in baking spices and cinnamon stick. Flavors follow suit, awash in rich vanilla and butterscotch with a layering of ripe tropical fruit and apple."
Martellotto,Rosé,87.0,20.0,1,"Honey and tuberose contribute to a powerful Orange Crush aroma on this Rhône white blend of 48% Marsanne, 40% Rousanne and 12% Viognier. Potpourri and flower water carry the palate, with a little slate and slight bitterness on the finish. Serve with a strawberry-spinach salad."
Martha Clara,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,84.0,40.0,1,"This feral, smoky Merlot-based Bordeaux blend relies on a mix of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Red and black berry fruit intermingle amidst robust, dry tannins to make a statement of size and power."
Martha Clara,Red Blend,82.0,13.0,1,"A brown sugar element, reminiscent of mincemeat pie, leads the nose on this wine, with a bit of Dr Pepper playing backup. The flavors are lean and easy, with roasted fennel and some elderberry fruit."
Martin & Weyrich,Moscato,86.0,12.0,2,"This is a 77% Cabernet Sauvignon with 20% Merlot and a smidgen of Malbec, given almost two years to mellow in 30% new French oak. There's a soft structure at the core of this wine and an overwhelming taste of leathery tannins overshadowing black cherry fruit, the finish slightly bitter."
Martin & Weyrich,Zinfandel,86.0,22.0,2,"Green apple and tangerine figure into this thin-layered wine that's sourced from estate vineyards as well as purchased Russian River Valley fruit. Straightforward and unfussy, the wine is ready to enjoy now."
Martin Lane Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,29.0,2,"There's a mildness to this wine that most tastes of dried cherry and cranberry, with a medium-bodied structure of moderate acidity. Forest floor and earthy compost dominate."
Martin Lane Winery,Primitivo,90.0,30.0,1,"Chalky tannin surrounds succulent baked plum and dark cherry, with chocolate and black licorice riding along in the back seat. This is a full-bodied, ripe wine."
Martin Lane Winery,Sangiovese,84.0,25.0,1,"Light aromas of apple, pear and petroleum jelly are followed by crisp acid-driven flavors. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
Martin Lane Winery,Syrah,88.8,28.2,5,"A very pretty pale salmon color, cherry and spice aromas are followed by light, tart, dry, mouthwatering fruit flavors. The concentration seems light but there's still much to enjoy."
Martin Ranch,Cabernet Franc,89.0,35.0,1,"As is often true of Southern Oregon Pinot Noir, this has a rather chunky fruit character, showing a cherry candy flavor. Aged in 30% new French oak, the wine is very lightly toasty, with a touch of heat in the finish."
Martin Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.67,40.5,6,"This wine has tart acidity that jumps from the glass, a taste of wet stone and lemon zest that's persistent through the midpalate. Along the way, a hint of grass, gooseberry and peach fuzz ride the waves of textured crispness."
Martin Ranch,Carignane,88.67,27.33,3,"Sweet-seeming oak aromas and flavors mingle with ripe fruit notes in this full-bodied, soft-textured and well-priced wine."
Martin Ranch,Chardonnay,86.75,27.5,4,"Ripe yellow apples and touches of banana and pineapple show on the nose of this bottling. It also has a restrained, steely frame to the aromas, along with some flint. Honeysuckle, jasmine and apple-blossom flavors show on the sip, which is quite floral, and also offers white peach and salt."
Martin Ranch,Grenache,87.0,20.0,1,"Red cherry, ripe cranberry, clove, star anise, dried plum skins and slate converge on the fairly complex nose of this bottling, with a label that features a whimsical map of Santa Barbara County. Light cranberry fruit meets with bay leaf on the sip that offers decent grip."
Martin Ranch,Malbec,90.0,40.0,3,"This bold, leathery red includes sizable additions of Petite Sirah, Merlot, Zinfandel and Cabernet Franc. These wrap layers of reduced oak, cedar, dried herb and pepper around a relatively light but round body, with a distinct taste of blackberry."
Martin Ranch,Merlot,91.0,26.0,1,"Dried black cherries, dried herbs, pencil shavings and touches of roasted meat and balsamic vinegar show on the nose of this bottling. The sip conveys smoked berries, dried strawberry, red plum and touches of oregano, marjoram and black pepper."
Martin Ranch,Nebbiolo,92.0,35.0,1,"Kool-aid character, light raspberry fruit, slightly candied, with an artificial tang to the finish."
Martin Ranch,Pinot Noir,88.67,31.83,6,"This full-bodied and densely textured wine has a deep color, aromas like wood smoke and blackberries, and flavors that saturate the palate with berries, clove and dark chocolate notes. It's bold in body, has plenty of tannins for grip, and a lingering, rich finish."
Martin Ranch,Sangiovese,86.25,31.25,4,"Aromas like mint, dried cherry and new oak complement bright, ripe fruit flavors in this full-bodied, densely textured wine. It has a lip-smacking freshness, lively tannins, a lot of complexity and a lingering finish."
Martin Ranch,Sauvignon Blanc,85.67,21.0,3,"From a valley-floor site, this blend of 70% Zinfandel and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon delights in a depth of blackberry and cedar, reflecting well on both varieties. Firm tannin and restrained oak provide room for a touch of gun smoke and pencil lead, with a lengthy finish."
Martin Ranch,Syrah,90.25,33.25,4,"Intriguing aromas of wilting rose petals, turned earth, wild mint and a lamb-like gamey character entertain the nose on this very special bottling. The palate is quite tart with cranberries, pomegranates and strawberries, with the fruits' bright acidity carrying deep into the finish."
Martin Ranch,Viognier,87.0,30.0,1,"A nose of sour cherry and cranberry meshes with sandalwood and savory herbs on this single-site study by the longtime Paso producer. The palate is overflowing with oregano and other dried garden herbs, laid against a juicy red and purple-fruit frame."
Martin Ranch,Zinfandel,87.0,26.0,1,"From Old Wente clones grown on the famous vineyard, this full-bodied, textured wine shows ripe elements of golden honey, Gravenstein apple and toasted vanilla oak. Along the way, it flirts nicely with pear and marzipan, finishing in balanced minerality."
Martin Ray,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.75,60.0,4,"A deep color and oodles of blackberry and boysenberry flavors lend a lot of impact to this full-bodied, ripe and almost jammy-tasting wine. It is generous, layered and concentrated but not overly serious in terms of tannins. Call it big but friendly."
Martin Ray,Chardonnay,91.17,35.0,6,"This wine brings spicy cranberry and strawberry, underscored with a whiff of leather. Flavors punch down and finish strong, with a leathery note that does not preclude the solid fruit."
Martin Ray,Pinot Noir,91.22,37.56,9,"Much like its companion from the Revelation & Sorek Bloc, this offers well-endowed flavors of melon and white peach, along with a touch of citrus. There is a sense of higher acidity, along with lower listed alcohol, rather counter-intuitive as this is the reserve. Pick either one and you'll be pleased."
Martin Ray,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,25.0,1,"A bit lighter in color than other Rhône blends, certainly due to the 40% Counoise (and bolstered by 36% Mourvèdre and 24% Grenache), this offers a punchy red-currant, orange-rind and chaparral-scrub nose. Fresh cracked black pepper, cranberry-orange-plum juice and a rich earthy tone show on the palate."
Martin Ray,White Blend,88.0,22.0,2,"Blistered red plum, savory herbs, black olive and a touch of green peppercorn show on the nose of this blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Petit Verdot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. Pencil lead and black peppercorns come through on the palate, spicing up the black-cherry, clay-earth and roasted-coffee flavors. It goes down easy."
Martin Ray,Zinfandel,90.5,30.0,2,"Dark red in color, there's an intense—for lack of a better word—grapy quality to this rustic wine. Kirsch and orange highlight the experience, before a faint structure falls short on the finish."
Martin Woods,Chardonnay,91.0,35.0,1,A mild streak of vanilla in both the aroma and flavor provides most of the taste and a smooth texture. Modest apple and honey flavors turn up on the finish. It's medium-bodied and soft in balance.
Martin Woods,Gamay,88.5,35.0,2,"Barrel aromas take the lead with notes of vanilla, dill and coconut followed by cherry, herbs and mesquite. Flavors are tart and medium bodied, with the fruit outpaced by the wood."
Martin Woods,Pinot Noir,90.0,40.0,1,"A blend of Chardonnay (60%) and Viognier, this is lightly reductive out of the gate, along with aromas of Band Aid and apple. It drinks a hair off dry, with melon and apple flavors."
Martin Woods,Riesling,89.0,25.0,1,"Thick and chocolaty, this wine is medium in weight, oak and texture, and struggles to show its fruit."
Martinelli,Pinot Noir,92.0,63.0,1,"Muted in somewhat floral sensibilities, this wine features a low dose of oak behind its blend of Merlot, Syrah, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Despite the preponderance of grapes, it somehow lacks fruit and manages to hit but one note, making for a soft, approachable and straightforward wine."
Martinez & Martinez,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,26.0,1,"Barnyard and gamy aromas are out in front on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (70%), Merlot (25%) and Cabernet Franc. The cherry flavors are reserved in style with a lightly chalky feel."
Martinez & Martinez,Cabernet Sauvignon,83.0,45.0,1,"This wine is a field blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache from Bishop's vineyard. Aromas of herbs, berry, cumin and wet copper penny are followed by smooth-feeling dark berry flavors with a tart, mesquite-filled finish."
Martinez & Martinez,Carmenère,85.0,38.0,1,"Leathery, dried cherry fruit flavors are set against streaks of earth, herb and a hint of barnyard. It's soft and eminently accessible, the tannins smooth and supple, with a hint of vanilla."
Martinez & Martinez,Pinot Grigio,86.0,17.0,1,"Whole clusters of Syrah are co-fermented with Viognier to create this tight, concisely crafted wine. This is a firm expression of field and grape, with bright berry fruit and chocolaty tannins. The slightly chalky finish may smooth out with a bit more bottle age."
Martinez & Martinez,Red Blend,85.0,20.0,1,"Another successful vintage for this wine, it maintains a clean, well-defined mouthfeel that barely registers the 1.3% residual sugar. The aromas of pear, melon and citrus rind introduce similar flavors, along with a suggestion of sweet orange candy."
Martinez & Martinez,Sauvignon Blanc,85.0,18.0,1,"Aromas of cedar, vanilla, raspberry, coffee, herbs and barrel spice are followed by concentrated fruit flavors backed by firm tannins. It's a delicious example of the variety."
Martinez & Martinez,Viognier,87.0,16.0,1,"Copper-pink hues shade the experience of this vintage sparkling wine, a dry expression of a warm year. It's dotted in crisp, refreshing flavors of watermelon, grapefruit and lemon zest."
Maryhill,Albariño,86.0,19.5,2,"This bottling, an ode to Bill Foley's Texas roots, is reserved on the nose with hints of yellow melon, peach blossom and a kiss of vanilla. The palate is straightforward and very drinkable, with seared brown pear and sea-salt flavors cruising across lemon-pith texture and a chalky grip."
Maryhill,Cabernet Franc,86.0,25.0,3,"Champoux and Ciel du Cheval vineyards each make up 40% of this wine, with the balance coming from Gamache. It's locked-up tightly at present with earth, tar, cherry, high-toned herb and barrel-spice aromas leading to focused black-fruit flavors that display elegance and persistence. Give it time to open up."
Maryhill,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.83,37.33,18,"The pencil lead, herb and vanilla aromas start out light and elusive. The black-cherry flavors, in contrast, are expressive, showing a good sense of balance and length."
Maryhill,Chardonnay,88.67,27.0,3,"An unusual blend of Primitivo, Barbera, Nebbiolo and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine displays light aromas of raspberries, cherries and herbs that take some time to tease out. The fruit flavors are ripe and ample, with bright, tart acidity providing the frame. Pair it with food to see it at its best."
Maryhill,Cinsault,87.0,26.0,1,"Aromas of coffee, toast, vanilla spice and dark fruit offer immediate appeal. The black-fruit flavors are ripe and generous, sticking around on the tart finish."
Maryhill,G-S-M,87.0,38.0,2,"Medium-crisp, this wine delights in stone fruit and lime zest, with a taste of fuzzy apricot dominant on the palate. Showing a balance of body and weight, it wraps things up with a layer of acidity."
Maryhill,Grenache,85.25,25.5,4,"A light mauve in color, this Pinot Noir-based wine shows boisterous plum fruit, macerated strawberries and a hint of clove on the ripe nose, making it more entrée-ready than apéritif-aimed. The palate offers strawberry and bubble-gum notes deftly hidden behind a veil of sour cherry and plum-skin tartness."
Maryhill,Malbec,89.0,32.5,2,"Woody blackberries meet with freshly plucked violets and lilacs on the snappy nose of this wine. The palate shows very tart berry fruit, but is driven more so by the asphalt and peppercorn elements."
Maryhill,Merlot,85.5,27.5,2,"The Sangiovese comes from Red Willow Vineyard, and it would be hard to find a more lovely, elegant rosé from this side of the Atlantic. Light strawberry and melon aromas continue onto the palate, with pinpoint detail and precision."
Maryhill,Moscato,88.0,12.0,1,"Put this into a blind flight of French rosé, and it will seem like one of the crowd. Crafted from 65% Grenache, 29% Syrah and 6% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is bone dry, dusty and detailed, showing a gorgeous onion-skin hue. The elegance and length are exceptional."
Maryhill,Primitivo,84.67,30.67,3,"Suma Kaw has been a vaunted vineyard source for some of the best Syrah in the Foothills. Opening with a gust of peppercorn and an herbal thread of pine, this Syrah dances on the edge of being overwhelming, with intense tannins weaving between the flavors of bright red fruit and smoky meat. It's enjoyable now, and will drink well in several years, too."
Maryhill,Red Blend,87.14,25.14,7,"An excellent follow-up to the luscious 2010, this features a generous array of melon, citrus and light tropical fruits. There is noticeable residual sugar—much in the style of the Sancerres from French producer Cotat—but at one-third the cost."
Maryhill,Rhône-style Red Blend,86.5,34.0,2,"This is a dark, sauvage, Cote-Rotie style of Syrah. It's full bodied, with tannins that have been tamed from the mountain fruit. Slightly warmer than some of Terre Rouge's others, the finish is lusty and packed with peppery spice. It would pair well with an equally gamy stew."
Maryhill,Sangiovese,85.86,28.0,7,"This blend of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon and 29% Merlot is sourced from the excellent DuBrul Vineyard. The fruit is magnificent, smoothly presented in a flow of cherry, plum and prune flavors. It seems soaked in chocolate, with a Bourbon-barrel highlight. The tannins are fine-grained and contribute to the overall length."
Maryhill,Sangiovese Cabernet,85.0,32.0,1,"Palisade remains principally Merlot, with a little Cabernet Sauvignon also in the blend. Smoky and focused, it's a riot of loganberry, blueberry and other blue and purple fruits. The tangy mouthfeel brings in streaks of coffee and mineral, with a tart, elegant finish."
Maryhill,Syrah,86.25,32.5,4,"No one does a better job with the Syrah from this vineyard than Mark Ryan McNeilly. Here, the peppery, just-ripe fruit is washed in a caramel bath. The flavors are long, and despite all of the barrel influence, the grapes have the muscle and texture to stand out equally."
Maryhill,White Blend,85.0,14.0,1,"This is concentrated and complex, with hints of flower, citrus flesh and rind, gooseberry and chamomile. It's labeled Columbia Valley but the Evergreen Vineyard, from where the grapes are sourced, sits in the heart of Washington's next likely American Viticultural Area—Ancient Lakes."
Maryhill,Zinfandel,86.6,36.8,5,"This is soft and lightly scented with citrus. Aromas of lemon peel precede light flavors of citrus and green apple. It's a simple, quaffable white wine, with a bit of Riesling and Viognier in the blend."
Mas Chappell,Lemberger,82.0,25.0,1,"This starts with concentrated boysenberry and raspberry fruit, but in the mouth some off-flavors intrude. The fruit is close to raisined, and the finish carries a hint of plastic. Two bottles tasted, consistent results."
Mas Chappell,Merlot,83.5,37.5,2,"Black cherry, cooked fig and prune fruit flavors are set in thick tannins. There's a bitter character similar to dark roasted espresso."
Mason Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,85.0,17.0,1,"The weak nose offers a bit of sour cherry, raspberry and menthol, but just barely. On the palate, there are rounded red fruit flavors and a light earthiness, but again just faint. That said, it does pair nicely with meatloaf or, assuredly, the Hitching Post restaurant's grilled artichoke."
Masthead,Sangiovese,90.0,30.0,1,"Rusticity goes a smidge too far here, without fruit that can handle the harsh tannins. It opens nicely, with pretty berry and cherry highlights, but in the mouth it gets chewy and finishes rough."
Matanzas Creek,Merlot,90.0,60.0,1,"Light to the point of being watery, it has dilute red berry flavors. A toasty edge, perhaps from new oak, is not fully integrated."
Matanzas Creek,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,40.0,2,"Wallywood is a Rhône-style red, with two thirds Syrah, while Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah fill in the rest. It surprises with its elegance, despite hefty alcohol and tannic components. It's a very well-done blend, melding together flavors of plum, berry, herb, stem, earth and iron."
Matchbook,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,15.0,1,"This rich, dark and earthy wine is pure Cabernet Sauvignon, done well and designed to appeal to those who favor dark barrel flavors along with their ripe fruit. Here, the flavors begins at licorice and runs through espresso, cacao and a finish of lightly charred tannins."
Matchbook,Chardonnay,87.7,17.1,10,"Neither oak aging nor malolactic fermentation was used here, hence the name. But far from madness, this wine is sleek, sensual, skillful and seductive. Crisp acidity, lemony minerality, an overriding freshness and excellent depth of flavor all combine to create a wine that seems to be more than the sum of its parts. Shellfish, light seafood, poultry and even pork dishes would be fine matches."
Matchbook,Red Blend,88.2,19.0,5,"Freedom Hill is one of the most-admired vineyards in the Willamette Valley, and this elegant wine does it full justice. A beguiling mix of roses, chocolate, berry and sandalwood, it tickles the nose and tongue with its precision and deceptive depth of flavor."
Matchbook,Rosé,85.0,13.33,3,"This cool-climate wine conveys a super-strong sense of gamy meat, like just-roasted lamb with mint jelly, along with boysenberry, bacon fat, Sichuan pepper and, with patience, prettier violet aromas too. The palate, which walks the balance beam between tannins and acidity, shows bloody meats along with black pepper, boysenberry and earth."
Matchbook,Tempranillo,84.0,12.0,1,"Whole-cluster fermented, this wine offers complexities of baked plum, raspberry and truffled earth. Generous in oak and structure, it also flashes lavender, rose and black licorice around a core of meaty game. Smooth on the palate, enjoy this wine through 2027."
Matello,Chardonnay,92.5,37.0,2,"Earthy and filled with baking spice, this wine offers floral aromas, bright acidity and flavors of baked strawberry compote steeped in cinnamon. Lush on the palate, as so many of the producer's wines are, it is quite mouthfilling and will take on more nuance with time, through 2022."
Materra Cunat Family Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.33,72.67,3,"From a steeply sloped site also planted to Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this thick, leathery wine shows undeniable power and intensity although it is still tannic and young. Heady bouts of lavender, red cherry and black licorice compete for attention on the palate amid intriguing floral, rose-like aromatics."
Materra Cunat Family Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.33,81.67,3,"Coming from a block of Clone 15 grapes that overlooks the historic San Ramon Chapel, this offers approachable, inviting aromas of sea salt, lemon-butter cookies and peach brûlée. An line of oyster shell minerality runs down the center of the palate but it is surrounded by warm oak and ripe flesh of apples, pears, white peach and pineapple."
Materra Cunat Family Vineyards,Chardonnay,88.0,23.67,3,"This barrel-fermented, estate-grown wine matches its luscious citrus and pineapple fruit to veins of butter, caramel and toast. It's perfectly balanced, lively and fresh, even after being open for a full 24 hours. The style, now becoming particular to many Oregon Chardonnays, sits squarely on the fence between the hyper-lushness of California and the minerality of northern Burgundies."
Materra Cunat Family Vineyards,Merlot,86.0,68.0,3,"Still tightly wound, this brings cranberry and raspberry fruit front and center. There's a hint of yeasty bread dough also, and the wine seems to still be emerging from its raw youth. Let it breathe, and a nice streak of deep, dark chocolate fills in the finish."
Materra Cunat Family Vineyards,Red Blend,85.0,110.0,1,"In the world of rare, single-vineyard Oregon Pinots, this is a relative bargain. The vineyard adjoins the St. Innocent winery, in a prime Eola-Amity location. The fruit delivers the subtle complexity and detail you hope for but don't always find in single-vineyard bottles. Brambly and floral with subtle notes of violets, rose petals, cured meat, orange rind and more, it's a dense and thought-provoking wine that rewards close attention."
Materra Cunat Family Vineyards,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,25.0,1,"A tribute to a famous gypsy jazz tune, the name means “clouds” in French. It's an elegant wine with ample acidity and sleek fruit flavors of raspberry and strawberry. A dusting of pumice coats the fruit, giving it grip and texture. The balance to age gracefully is immediately evident. Drink 2017–2025 for maximum enjoyment."
Matrix,Chardonnay,83.0,36.0,1,"The proprietary name indicates that this is the winemaker's reserve cuvée, a three-barrel selection mixing equal proportions of grapes from the Eola Hills, Dundee Hills and Ribbon Ridge AVAs. It's austere, tight and yet authoritative, showing compact wild berry fruit, Mediterranean herbs and a slight saltiness. It's best to cellar it until 2020, or give it a good long decant."
Matrix,Petite Sirah,88.0,34.0,1,"A blend of Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer, it's vibrantly aromatic with notes of spice, white grapefruit, and lychee. The concrete tank aging provides a sense of freshness while Celilo Vineyard's electric acidity beautifully balances out the residual sugar (16.3 g/L)."
Matrix,Pinot Noir,88.75,53.5,4,"Still youthful and showing a fair amount of barrel in the nose, this unfined and unfiltered single-vineyard Chardonnay will benefit from another few years of cellaring. Fresh apple and peach flavors anchor a solid mid palate."
Matrix,Zinfandel,88.5,32.5,4,"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style."
Matteo,Chenin Blanc,92.0,50.0,1,"Certainly among the most unusual wines from this vineyard, here is a Pinot Gris with 30 g/L residual sugar and alcohol under 11%. There is sufficient acidity—along with the minerality that the vineyard is known for—to keep the flavors of citrus rind and flesh well rounded and buoyant. Sweet enough to pair with a fruity dessert."
Matteo,Merlot,85.0,40.0,1,"The blackberry jam, green olive, smoked meat, dried herb, gravel, flower and orange peel aromas provide plenty of interest and intrigue, though a tire rubber note distracts. The black fruit and savory flavors coat the palate with a supple feel that brings depth."
Matthews,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,55.0,7,"The aromas of lemon, soil and flowers are quite subdued. The flavors are restrained with impressive balance and the variety's often burly tannins well tamed."
Matthews,Red Blend,90.67,30.0,3,"This provides a very good example of the varietal in a velvety-smooth style. It tastes dry but generous, nicely balanced and just tannic enough to be appetizing. Flavors are a warm combination of berries, light spices and a touch of oak."
Matthews,Sauvignon Blanc,90.33,33.33,3,"Soy, black fruit and asphalt aromas are strong on the nose of this wine by the Four Sisters project. The palate is varietally pure, with black pepper, tar and boysenberry. It dives a bit deeper as well, showing coffee and dark chocolate character."
Matthews Estate,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.5,34.0,2,"A tribute to the art of blending, this wine is a mix of 10 different varieties with none making up even a third of the blend. It leads with aromas of plummy blue fruit, smoke, vanilla and herbs followed by plump fruit flavors and lightly grippy tannins."
Matthews Estate,Sauvignon Blanc,83.0,30.0,1,"Dark coffee, dried herb and whole green-pepper aromas mix with notes of cherry, black plum and vanilla. The black-fruit flavors are rich but still show a sense of elegance."
Mattina Fiore,Albariño,91.0,24.0,1,"This crisp white is inviting and dry, with aromas of citrus, fig and fennel. Reminiscent of a fine Sancerre, it's finely structured, steely and still lushly textured and full enough in the mouth to enjoy with seafood, a creamy goat cheese salad or entirely on its own."
Mattina Fiore,Chardonnay,91.0,40.0,1,"A terrific vintage for the Freedom Hill bottling, the 2008 displays a firm, concentrated core of cranberry, raspberry and pie-cherry fruit flavors. Wrapped in plenty of toasty new oak, the wine is powerful and mouth-coating, balanced with juicy acidity, and rolls on through a lengthy, satisfying finish."
Mattina Fiore,G-S-M,91.0,50.0,2,"This begins as a hard, tight wine with hints of rose petal around a core of blackberry hard candy. The balance is superb, and the wine is lively with nuanced, dark notes blending smoke, espresso and bitter chocolate. An intriguing animal scent surfaces after some hours of breathing."
Mattina Fiore,Grenache,93.0,60.0,1,"Once again the Jerome Reserve delivers the goods—a fine core of ripe cherry fruit, wrapped in pretty new oak. It's full-bodied, round and textural, while retaining a crisp, well-defined focus. Barrel aging adds complexity, with streaks of coffee, licorice and dark chocolate."
Mattina Fiore,Rosé,88.0,24.0,1,"A pretty pale peach color, the strawberry aromas are quite light while the flavors are tart and spritely. It piques the interest."
Mattina Fiore,Syrah,93.0,50.0,1,"This is a dry, crisp, forward, well-aged wine that blends five aromatic white grapes, principally Gruner Veltliner and Pinot Gris. Already showing signs of oxidation, it's a pleasant, though nondescript white wine that should be consumed by 2018."
Mattina Fiore,Viognier,92.0,40.0,1,"Sturdy and tannic, this offers subtle suggestions of rosewater and cocoa powder around pleasant plum fruit. Drink it over the next two or three years; decanting will help to smooth it out."
Mattucci,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,45.0,1,"Full-bodied and forward, this offers fruit flavors of spiced cherry, along with a broad streak of vanilla. The tannins hit hard and carry a slightly charred, slightly bitter aftertaste."
Mauritson,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,50.0,1,"Blending 90% Sauvignon Blanc with 10% Sémillon, this white is perfumed in jasmine and apricot honey. On the palate it becomes somewhat fleshier and less expressive, allowing for just a hint of peach."
Mauritson,Petite Sirah,92.0,41.0,1,"Klopp is a mix of California and Burgundy clones, one of the producer's finest offerings every year, made in an opulent, balanced style. Lush layers of strawberry and cherry are surrounded by truffle-like dirt. The wine is concentrated in tannin and subtle oak, while anise marks the measured finish. The wine will benefit from time in the cellar through 2020."
Mauritson,Syrah,92.0,41.0,1,"The nose on this Ethan Lindquist-made wine from the cool-climate vineyard his parents planted shows a fabulous but not overripe cornucopia of espresso, tobacco leaf, oregano and lava rocks. The flavors are quite savory, with dried blueberries, teriyaki, beef jerky, roasted meat, lavender, rosemary and a citrus-like acidity framing the edges."
Mauritson,Zinfandel,90.0,41.0,1,"Norm Yost named this wine after his wife. It shows rich, deep and mysterious aromas, from dried rose petals and cherries to funky mushrooms, fresh-cut sagebrush, maple and damp wood. It's very full once sipped, with a mushroom ragu element cut by red cherries, orange peels, cranberries and a forest floor finish. This Pinot could handle a big steak."
Mayo,Pinot Noir,89.0,35.0,2,"This is an outrageously appealing wine with aromas of smoke, dried herbs and abundant peppery spices. It's sensuous and layered in feel, with generous dark fruit and black pepper flavors. It shows a profound sense of elegance, purity and detail with a finish that seems unending—a complete knee buckler."
Maysara,Pinot Gris,88.0,23.0,1,"This offers reserved notes of cherry and raspberry compote, cranberry, earth and assorted dried herbs. With the oak pleasantly dialed back, the focus remains on the fruit. The palate displays exquisite purity, elegance and detail, with a light grip of tannins pulling it all together. It's drinking beautifully now, but you could open it up in 2025 or 2030 and it wouldn't bat an eye."
Maysara,Pinot Noir,88.4,43.2,10,"The nose on this wine is both subtle and deep, showing dried rose petals, cherry kirsch, black currants and a hint of elderberry. It's silky once sipped, with licorice, mocha and dark raspberry all set against tart cherry-skin tannins that give plenty of structure for aging. Drink 2018–2028."
Mazzocco,Chardonnay,91.0,36.0,1,"Winemaker Carl Bowker delivers a great-smelling wine on this blend of 64% Tempranillo and 36% Grenache, with aromas of purple fruit, violets and a pepper-crusted bacon. The palate suggests a very flavorful pork roast in plum sauce, showing hoisin, ripe blackberries and grape candy, proving simultaneously playful and elegant."
Mazzocco,Petite Sirah,88.0,35.0,1,"This is a terrific representation of all that is spectacularly specific about Keefer Ranch, a relatively cool site for grapes in Green Valley. Earthy and spicy in clove and nutmeg, the wine is layered in cranberry and crisp cherry. It's supple and silky on the palate, with an earthy oomph to the finish."
Mazzocco,Zinfandel,86.71,44.0,7,"Dried apple peels, squeezed nectarines, creamy cherimoya and quinine combine on this fresh and salty nose from winemaker Steve Fennell. A pine nut warmth opens the palate, followed by an array of exotic flavors like lychee, lemongrass and kiwi, plus some citrusy cider and salt. It's broad enough to appeal to the masses, but retains enough acidity for refined palates."
McCay Cellars,Cinsault,89.0,39.0,1,"Winemaker Adam Lee goes big on this bottling from the vineyard planted by the two Garys (Pisoni and Franscioni), showing bacon fat, blackberries and graphite on the nose. Once sipped, it veers more tart, with cranberry and just-ripe raspberry picking up some complexity from thyme herbs."
McCay Cellars,Red Blend,88.0,24.0,1,"Brian Loring makes this spicy wine from a vineyard in the hills overlooking Highway 101 east of Nipomo. Cinnamon powder pumps up aromas of pomegranate, saddle leather and raspberry. It's lively with chai spices and typical cranberry juice at first, then the acidic structure reveals a more savory side, with cherry tomato, tapenade and dried meats on the finish."
McCay Cellars,Tempranillo,87.0,28.0,1,"The fruit is sourced from multiple vineyards across the appellation, including Eastside Estate, a vineyard formerly known as 3 Starrs recently purchased by the producer. Aromas of exotic plumeria provide an inviting entry, followed by a subtle, yet lightly rich expression of yellow apple and ample minerality. Everything combines for a balanced wine that's not overly heavy or overripe."
McCay Cellars,White Blend,91.0,24.0,1,"Made from 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot from Stillwater Creek and Conner Lee vineyards, this standout wine beautifully displays the strength of the 2012 vintage. Aromas of dark roasted coffee beans, café au lait, graphite and dark cherry lead to sweet, layered, persistent fruit flavors with a lingering, open finish. It's near-irresistible now but will peak from 2021 to 2025."
McCay Cellars,Zinfandel,89.0,36.5,6,"Hailing from Elephant Mountain Vineyard, this new offering—blended with 15% Merlot—brings aromas of fresh and dried herbs, pencil lead, mocha, potting soil and flowers. It's rich and flavorful with coffee and cherry notes backed by exceptionally integrated tannins, all leading to a lingering finish."
McClean,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,20.0,1,"Alluringly seductive aromas of black cherry syrup, blueberry pie, blackberry preserves and fresh-cracked black pepper draw the nose into this blend of Lone Oak and Valley View vineyards, located 800 to 1,000 feet in elevation. Flavors of blackberry-chocolate liqueur, plums and black cherries are elevated by pine sap, rosemary and strong tannins that maintain perfect grip. Serve with lamb."
McClean,Red Blend,93.0,20.0,1,"This richer, rounder version of dry rosé is pale salmon in color, smells lightly fruity and has a savory white-pepper touch in the flavor. The texture is more mouthcoating and smooth than many."
McClean,Zinfandel,90.0,16.0,2,"With a mildness to the body and texture, this is big, burly red wine at its most bombastic, an explosion of berry pie and vanilla ice cream that lingers in spicy cinnamon. Ripe and robust, it delivers plenty of flavor and smoothness."
McClean X,Syrah,88.0,20.0,1,"This wine offers soft, malleable red berry, vanilla and marshmallow flavors, making for a ripe, perceptibly sweet experience. Full bodied and densely packed in mellow tannin and oak, it includes a notable hint of peppercorn, and will go well with something similarly appointed, like pepper steak."
McConnell Estates Winery,Merlot,88.0,16.0,1,Light fig and pear flavors on a rich texture make this wine a sleeper. Quiet on the first sip it gains ripeness and interest with subsequent tastes. It's very smooth and full in the mouth.
McConnell Estates Winery,Zinfandel,84.0,18.0,1,"Despite the late harvest label, this is not a dessert wine. It's been fermented to near-dryness, and the late-picked fruit has resulted in quite high alcohol. It's an odd duck, but tasty with an appealing lemon-drop candy flavor."
McCrea,Chardonnay,90.0,30.0,1,"A charred, peppery aroma and a stiff, tannic mouthfeel go along with dark-fruit flavors in this full-bodied blend of Zinfandel and Petite Sirah."
McCrea,Counoise,87.0,32.0,2,"This is a tasty, juicy, easy-drinking wine with good fruit flavors. Well balanced and medium bodied, it offers some of the density and texture expected, but without going over the top in tannins."
McCrea,Marsanne,91.0,25.0,1,"This is a dry wine meant for the dinner table. It has blackberry and raspberry aromas, concentrated fruit flavors, firm tannins and a taut finish. It will be best to drink after 2018."
McCrea,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,28.0,1,"Using the all-too-confusing “extra dry” designation for a rather sweet sparkling wine seems unnecessary for this re-named wine with spiffy new packaging. The blend is 63% Chardonnay, 19% Pinot Noir and 18% Pinot Gris; the flavors are a mix of citrus rind and crystalized sugar. The finish, despite the sweetness, is slightly bitter."
McCrea,Roussanne,90.0,25.0,1,"This wine has muscle and grip; it's a densely layered Cabernet, based upon cassis and loam, with firm, muscular tannins. At the moment it does not extend its power into the finish, but rather it seems to stop short. Try giving it extra breathing time."
McCrea,Syrah,92.0,37.0,4,"Consistent with the Lake Chelan winery's lineup of red wines, this young Syrah brings a lot of generous, berry-flavored primary fruits, softened tannins and a deep purple color. The opening cherry and berry fruit, turning a little pruney and limned by citrusy acids, leads into a tart midpalate with some earth and granite underlying the fruit."
McCrea,Viognier,89.5,25.0,2,"This is a European-style Syrah, cofermented with 2% Viognier. It's soft and round, medium in body, and has a savory midpalate with flavors of cranberry, plum and pepper. On the finish is a hint of smoky oak. Profits from sales of the wine go to the American River Conservancy Wakamatsu Colony Preservation and Restoration project."
McCrea,White Blend,91.67,23.67,3,"The aromas of vanilla, herb and cherry show some volatility. The cherry flavors are light, finishing tart."
McCrea Cellars,Grenache Blanc,87.0,25.0,1,"The volatiles are amped up here, providing distraction from the cherry and spice aromas. It's a shame as the palate delivers plenty of plump lightly sweet cherry flavors."
McCrea Cellars,Marsanne,87.0,25.0,2,"This dry, tart wine smells like sliced apples and has lemon pastry-like flavors without the sweetness. The palate is full-bodied but cut with a zing of lemon and green apple."
McCrea Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,20.0,1,"Borderline translucent in color, and equally light in the nose. The aromas are of cranberry and chlorine. The palate is all strawberry and some bitter oak, and while it picks up steam and fills out with time, the initial impression is hard to overcome."
McCrea Cellars,Rhône-style White Blend,92.0,25.0,1,"A bit weedy in the nose, with notes of pepper and salsa. The flavor profile runs sour, with rhubarb and pie cherries sticking out. The mouthfeel is where the wine suffers most; it's hard and aggressive, with piercing tannins and acids that combine forces to starch out your palate and cheeks."
McCrea Cellars,Syrah,90.17,36.33,6,"While not smelling much like typical Viognier, this southern Oregon offering is round, sweet and ripe, with honey and apple flavors. The finish is sweet and honeyed, and also quite short. A chunky, full-bodied mouthfeel is the most typical characteristic of the wine."
McCrea Cellars,Viognier,88.0,25.0,1,"This is a wine the winery has lavished some extra care on:  barrel fermentation, 50% new oak, extra time in barrel. But the results are disappointing. A thin, sour wine, it has a bitter edge to it and a finish that suggests that something went wrong in the barrel."
McEvoy Ranch,Pinot Noir,92.0,45.0,1,Review text not available at this time.
McEvoy Ranch,Red Blend,89.0,35.0,1,"A 100% varietal wine from the producer's estate, the grapes planted in rocky volcanic soils, this wine showcases a thicket of blueberry and smoky meat, with a high-toned backbone of acidity helping to keep it from becoming overbearing. Ripe, the tannins are soft and chewy."
McEvoy Ranch,Rosé,90.0,20.0,1,"This blend of 64% Syrah and 36% Cabernet Sauvignon is starting to show its age, with light prune, dried cherry-tobacco and clove aromas. Dried strawberry, star anise and baking spice arise on the palate, which is full of flavor but should be enjoyed soon."
McGah Family,Petit Verdot,90.0,50.0,1,"There's some nice weight and spice here in this mild-mannered Graciano, adept in its baked plum and strawberry flavor, spicy leather throughout the soft textures with a pronounced savory hit on the finish. Pair with grilled meats or paella."
McGrail,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,38.0,5,"A spicy blend of 44% Grenache, 32% Syrah and 24% Tempranillo, all grown in Fair Play, an increasingly interesting place for Rhône varieties. With soft swirls of fruity plum amid masculine tobacco and leather, there's a lusciousness to the finish that's appealing but could use a bit more of a kick."
McGrail,Merlot,90.0,36.0,1,"This sharp, spicy, herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc showcases the flavors of the Columbia Gorge AVA. It's a pungent wine, with sweet grassy flavors and a hint of toast, despite fermentation in stainless steel. Unusual but interesting."
McGregor,Gewürztraminer,85.0,20.0,1,"Erath makes a solid, reliable, all-purpose but somewhat generic Oregon Pinot Noir. This blended wine fills a desperate need for something that can represent good old basic Oregon Pinot Noir. It's accessible and spicy, with clean and tangy red fruits. A bit sharp and acidic, it should improve over the next couple of years as it softens out."
McGregor,Red Blend,84.0,60.0,1,"Pinot Noir from Washington? Yes, it's possible, and in this case, exceptional. Don't look for California sweetness and extract here, but you'll find genuine varietal character and perfect ripeness, without the leafy, tomato flavors that can plague parts of Oregon. This is gentle, elegant, light and captivating, like a perfectly made Bourgogne rouge from a great vintage."
McIlroy,Chardonnay,86.0,36.0,1,"This is a benchmark rendition of Pinot Gris. The flavors are fruit driven, with lime, apple and pear notes combining on the smooth, relatively soft midpalate. This is a consistent wine, even with its production level of 100,000 cases."
McIntyre Vineyards,Chardonnay,92.33,40.67,3,"Made from 100% Barbera, this has perfumed aromatics and flavors of raspberry and peach. It's sweetness is in check—ideal for food with some heat, like Thai or Mexican."
McIntyre Vineyards,Merlot,86.0,22.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Merlot (28%), Cabernet Franc (26%), Petit Verdot (21%), Cabernet Sauvignon (15%) and Tempranillo. Aromas of red fruit, herbs, pencil eraser and tobacco are followed by full-feeling red and black fruit flavors backed by grainy tannins."
McIntyre Vineyards,Pinot Noir,90.7,37.4,10,"Cranberry, blueberry, vanilla and milk chocolate aromas are at the fore. It's silky in feel with a reserved styling."
McKinley Springs,Red Blend,85.67,16.0,3,"While fresh and fruity in aroma, this feels full bodied, tastes rich but not sweet, and has a smooth texture. Aromas like apples and bananas tone down to milder spicy, baked-apple flavors that stay through the finish."
McKinney,Red Blend,89.0,30.0,1,"The aromas on this wine lean into the green, with notes of herbs, cedar and woodspice that seem somewhat at odds with the variety. The supple flavors show a mixture of intensity and restraint."
McManis,Barbera,86.75,11.25,4,"Lots of fruit flavors and lots of tannin make this both generous and a bit tight at the same time. While the ripe black cherry and blackberry aromas and flavors are tempting, the texture is firm and may need until 2018 to smooth for best drinking."
McManis,Chardonnay,87.0,10.0,1,"This 75% Cabernet with 20% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot opens with spicy black pepper and smoky leather, showing full-bodied tannin and texture. Varietal characteristics of cedar play in the shadows, while the overall experience takes its time to wind down on the finish."
McManis,Pinot Noir,84.0,12.0,1,"From another section of the Los Chamizal Vineyard, Morning Sun is taut in red cherry and raspberry, a citrusy component giving it lightness and zest. Leather and black pepper come to life on the finish."
McManis,Red Blend,90.0,17.33,3,"From great farmers and a great site, this wine somehow never comes fully to life, offering a muted taste of cherry and strawberry around minty dollops of earth and dried herb."
Meadowcroft,Cabernet Franc,87.0,32.0,1,"Tight and tannic, this single-vineyard offering emphasizes flavors of herb, grass and green leaf. There's a hint of pale, generic red fruit, but it's more in the veggie camp—think rhubarb rather than raspberry. A hint of brown sugar rounds out the finish."
Meadowcroft,Pinot Noir,87.0,31.0,2,"Principally Tempranillo, this blended red shows light berry fruit and stiff, earthy tannins. Aged 17 months in 17% new French oak, it doesn't quite come into balance, and finishes with chalky acids."
Meadowcroft,Riesling,88.0,26.0,1,"The ripest and strongest of the Lodi Native wines this year, this has raspberry and black pepper aromas tinged with dusty, earthy accents, and heavy flavors like stewed plums."
Meadowcroft,Viognier,92.0,30.0,1,"This wine is comprised of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Dusty earthiness frames its green, vegetal flavors, wrapped in ripe, sturdy tannins and bitter leather and clove notes."
Medlock Ames,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.33,48.33,3,"This organically farmed field blend includes some Petite Sirah and Alicante Bouschet. It has soft acidity and a simple structure, the flavors a mix of red and black cherry and berry."
Medlock Ames,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.33,57.5,6,"This is a light-bodied, simple and straightforward wine with a generous helping of toasted oak, tropical fruit and sweet vanilla notes."
Medlock Ames,Chardonnay,88.5,42.0,2,"This wine offers earthy funkiness and simple coconut and red currant notes, its structure somewhat muted and one-dimensional."
Medlock Ames,Malbec,91.0,60.0,1,"Extremely light in color and shy on the nose, this is closer to water than wine. The flavors are also faint, recalling only slight touches of red apple and pear."
Medlock Ames,Merlot,87.0,50.0,1,"A sweaty nose obscures light strawberry flavors. Yeasty and thin, it's best used as a mixer."
Medlock Ames,Pinot Noir,89.0,50.0,1,"A blend of blocks and clones from this impressive property, this Pinot delivers pretty raspberry and cherry fruit, dusted with baking spices. From the opening aromas of fruit and flower, on through to the bigger barrel flavors of clove and cinnamon, this is a lovely wine, drinking well, but certainly fit for cellaring through 2020–2022."
Medlock Ames,Rosé,87.0,27.0,1,"Barrel fermented and put through full malolactic with regular batonnage, this superbly balanced, graceful Chardonnay is orchestrated around a complex mix of pear, tropical fruit, biscuit, cream soda and light baking spices. The acidity carries a hint of mineral, and the palate impression is lively and smooth."
Medlock Ames,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,27.0,2,"The Ribbon Ridge estate delivers beautifully ripened fruit—so ripe, in fact, that the first impression is of sweet tree fruits, although the wine is actually quite dry. Peaches, citrus and nectarines are in the mix, and when the tangy acidity kicks in, a long, mineral-driven ride across the palate ensues. Luscious, long and detailed, this is a spectacular Riesling."
Meeker,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,62.0,1,"Perhaps a bit more time in barrel differentiates this from the equally-good Reserve. This is a smooth, supple, deeply-fruited wine, loaded with layers of black cherry, cola and sandalwood. Milk chocolatey tannins roll through the finish, smooth as silk, lingering and luscious."
Meeker,Zinfandel,85.0,23.33,3,"This block selection really works, showing more muscle and meat on its bones than the excellent vineyard-designated bottling. Black fruits, cassis and clean earth are flecked with cinnamon. The wine has authority and power, yet retains a sculpted, fine-tuned precision."
Megan Anne,Pinot Noir,92.0,60.0,3,"Light and lean on entry, this wine builds up steam and power as it develops in the glass, becoming a robust exploration of rhubarb and cranberry. The texture on the palate is velvety and moderately rich, dotted in sultry spice."
Mellisoni,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,107.0,2,"Sweeter notes of honeysuckle and peach meet with dried lime peel on the nose of this widely available bottling by the Niven family. Rounded honeydew and key lime flavors ride a steely structure on the tongue, making for a solid weeknight sipper."
Mellisoni,Pinot Grigio,82.0,35.0,1,"This is a smooth-textured and well-balanced wine. It smells a little smoky, but tastes moderately crisp and tannic, with ripe fruit favors to balance out the tartness."
Mellisoni,Rosé,82.0,35.0,1,"Light herb, green olive and earth aromas are followed by broad cranberry, cherry and orange peel flavors in this wine. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but should fit well at the dinner table."
Mellisoni,White Blend,84.0,45.0,2,"This clean if somewhat simple bottling starts with an extremely light and delicate nose of red cherry, rust, sagebrush, thyme and anise. The texture is light on the sip but the tannins prove somewhat grippy, with flavors of pomegranate and cracked pepper."
Melrose,Chardonnay,87.0,24.0,1,"Light dried orange peel, herb and candlewax aromas lead to broad, medium-bodied fruit flavors in this white. It's enjoyable despite the muted aromatic expression."
Melrose,Pinot Noir,87.5,38.5,2,"This shows vanilla, clove, barrel spice and dark fruit aromas. Its fruit flavors are full and laced with upfront barrel notes. It seems a little boozy."
Melrose,Red Blend,88.0,30.0,1,"This wine's red and yellow apple and melon aromas lead to broad, fleshy fruit flavors. It's direct and delivers a lot of appeal."
Melrose,Rosé,84.0,15.0,1,"Vanilla, cocoa, barrel spice and herb aromas are followed by creamy fruit and barrel flavors. The vanilla notes overwhelm the nose and palate, however, distracting from the fruit."
Melrose,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,18.0,1,"From one of Steven Kent's favorite Livermore Valley vineyards, Ghielmetti, this vintage of Lola is 65% Sauvignon Blanc and 35% Sémillon, the SB picked first off the vineyard; the Sémillon last of the whites. Whole-cluster pressed, it is briny, with a marine-like influence of savory and steely characteristics. Rich, but not too rich, it's freshened by notes of lemon and lime."
Melrose,Syrah,85.0,20.0,1,"Rich but balanced aromas of caramel, vanilla, blueberry pie with buttery crust, allspice, clove and mace whirl into an amazingly seductive nose on this wine by former NFL star Terry Hoage. It's luscious on the palate, with Vietnamese coffee, burnt caramel, black cherries, blueberry paste and smoked oak, yet balanced and tingling with acidity throughout."
Melville,Chardonnay,92.33,30.67,6,"The Paso pioneer's annual bottling of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc does not disappoint, offering aromas of plump, dark blueberry, tart Bing cherry and bay leaf. The palate offers crushed herbs—from oregano and thyme to rosemary and dill—alongside more blueberry fruit and a solid yet smooth tannic structure."
Melville,Pinot Noir,93.86,49.14,7,"Thick, rich and tightly wound, this cool-climate wine from near the town of the same name is brightly acidic and floral. A mix of rose petal, violet and dried herbes de Provence on the nose echoes on the palate. Bing and dark cherry provide a sultry fruitiness that never dominates over the piquant cardamom spice. Drink now through 2023."
Melville,Syrah,92.6,36.8,5,"This wine comes from the coolest pocket of the producer's estate, the last part typically picked. It offers a study in savory tannin development and thickness, the skins unable to soften gently in the cold. Earthy clove defines the flavor, along with a leathery meatiness and firm structure. A suggestion of black cherry tries to muddle through. Drink now through 2023."
Mercer,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.25,40.5,4,"From the steepest, east-facing block of the estate vineyard, given 15% whole-cluster fermentation, this is a dense, brooding wine, spicy and concentrated in blueberry and black cherry. It has a tenacity of earthiness that never lets go, lingering on the full-bodied palate for days. Drink now through 2023."
Mercer,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.12,70.25,8,"Barrel notes of vanilla and spice take the lead in this aromatically brooding wine, followed by dried herbs and dark fruit. The flavors are pitch black, coating the palate from end to end with layers of fruit, tannins that go the distance and a graphite-filled finish that lingers. It will drink best from 2020–2027."
Mercer,Chardonnay,87.0,30.0,2,"This blend is near-equal parts Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon along with a healthy dollop of Petit Verdot (18%). It shows a mix of fruit and savory elements, with notes of potting soil, green coffee bean, mocha, fresh herbs, licorice, generous barrel spices and red and black fruit—showing more with each swirl. The fruit and chocolate flavors are dense and rich, with bright acids and a firm core of tannins. The balance is spot-on and the finish lingers. It drinks beautifully now but you can expect it to age for another 20 years."
Mercer,Malbec,88.0,42.75,4,"Former L.A. Laker Sasha Vujacic presents aromas of cooked black plums, mission figs, black currants, uncrushed peppercorns and leather on this reserve bottling. It spent 30 months in the barrel, six more than the estate bottling. The palate offers more plums and tarter plum skin along with bay leaf, oregano and thyme."
Mercer,Petit Verdot,91.0,33.0,1,"Though the flavors are one dimensional, they are substantial, with a mix of plum and black-cherry fruit at the center. There are strong streaks of citrus and soil, with astringent tannins and acids that stick out with a somewhat chalky, citrus character."
Mercer,Red Blend,86.75,27.5,4,"Almost neutral in flavor, this light and smooth wine is innocuous, crisp and refreshing."
Mercer,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,40.0,2,"The aromas are surprisingly light for the variety, with notes of rose water and flowers. It drinks off dry, with lightly styled fruit flavors, with the concentration wanting."
Mercer,Riesling,87.0,15.0,1,"Light aromas of tropical fruit, apple, melon and spice lead to lightly styled fruit flavors. The concentration doesn't seem to be all there."
Mercer,Rosé,86.33,13.67,3,"This fruity wine brings a mix of strawberry and watermelon, in a smooth and simple format. There's a suggestion of some over-ripe fruit in the mix, so best to drink this chilled down."
Mercer,Sangiovese,85.0,33.0,2,"This is a somewhat dull red, leathery in texture and simple in approach, offering a mix of black cherry and licorice."
Mercer,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,15.0,1,"From a vineyard within the Oak Knoll District, this Bluetooth is musky and chewy in all the right ways, complex and feral in crisp red fruit and red licorice. The majority Cabernet Sauvignon is softened somewhat by the addition of 5% Merlot, providing a juicy undercurrent beneath firm, generous tannins. Cellar through 2022."
Mercer,Syrah,88.29,39.14,7,"From one of the best-known sites for the variety in the Napa Valley, this wine shows classic Merlot-structure, with an almost dusty quality to the well-integrated and resolved tannins. It discloses a density of red fruit that remains in balance with its more rugged minerality, remaining soft on the palate throughout. Drink now through 2025."
Mercer,Viognier,87.0,14.67,3,"Grapefruit blossoms, Meyer lemon skin and faints hint of tropical, white peach-flavored crème brûlée unite for a sleek and dynamic nose on this bottling of four grape clones. Vanilla, lemon zest and flavors of limes cooked in butter show on the delicious palate."
Mercer Canyons,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,17.0,1,"Wet, hot concrete, blueberry paste, olallieberry jelly and black-fig aromas swirl on the nose of this delicious boutique bottling by Jeremy Weintraub, also winemaker at Adelaida. The palate is evenly measured, showing a solid structure with grippy black fruits, espresso, cola and Dr Pepper flavors."
Mercy,Chardonnay,90.25,27.5,4,"Entirely estate-grown, this is a gorgeous wine—crisp in red cherry, pomegranate and floral tones, with a fleshy, textured and juicy palate. Richly layered, the chalky tannins are fine-grained, underpinning a flavor structure of dried herb. Dark chocolate lingers on the finish. It has plenty of years to go; cellar through 2022."
Mercy,Pinot Noir,91.45,36.0,11,"Toasty graham crackers and nutmeg make for a compelling entry into this wine, a blend of Petite Sirah, Merlot, Carignan, Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. The disparate elements come together in a bold, concentrated way, the tannins integrated around dark, black fruit and leathery black pepper."
Mercy,Riesling,88.0,20.0,2,"Mandarin orange Creamsicle, Cool Whip with vanilla bean and lemon-butter aromas show on the nose of this richer bottling from a winery that overlooks both Silicon Valley and the Pacific Ocean. Vanilla and butter also entertain the palate, but not in an overpowering way, boosted by cotton candy and a touch of dill-like herbs."
Mercy,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,22.0,2,"Sourced from the Glenrose Vineyard and aged for three years in 132-gallon puncheons before extended bottle time, this memorable wine offers leather, red cherry, rust, pencil lead and vanilla bean on the sanguine nose. Fine-grained tannins carry elegant, leathery flavors of smoked berries, with tense pencil shavings that will firmly structure the juice for years. Drink 2017–2030."
Mercy,Syrah,93.0,28.0,1,"Biodynamically farmed Momtazi Vineyard is a favorite of several high-end Willamette Valley producers. Fresh cranberry and raspberry scents introduce a young wine still showing a blue shade around the rim. It's silky and sensuous, with blue plum, black cherry, dark chocolate and notes of earth and iron."
Merriam,Cabernet Franc,86.75,43.75,4,"Veteran vintner Bryan Babcock offers a ripe style in this bottling, with showy aromas of strawberry, blackberry, graphite, pipe smoke and roasted meats. It's big and dense on the palate, with dried strawberry and squeezed pomegranate fruits, brown spice of cloves, allspice, nutmeg and gingerbread, and the tart cut of orange juice."
Merriam,Chardonnay,86.0,50.0,1,"A big, dry wine rich in red fruit and sizable tannins, this 100% varietal, single-vineyard designated offering is buoyed by silky, fine-grained tannins that support its voluptuous nature. More savory than sweet in terms of ripeness, its flavors lean toward tobacco and black tea. Drink now through 2022."
Merriam,Merlot,87.5,30.0,2,"Loads of purple fruit and baked goods show on the nose of this 36% Mourvèdre, 34% Grenache and 30% Syrah blend, reminiscent of blueberry pie and olallieberry-vanilla muffins. Flavors are plump and ripe, like blackberry cookie dipped in caramel-milk chocolate sauce. Fans of big Paso reds, rejoice."
Merriam,Pinot Noir,87.12,35.75,8,"This is an inaugural release of this variety from the Mount George Vineyard in cool Coombsville, granted AVA status in 2011. Juicy and soft in blackberry and stone fruit, the wine is cradled by generous tannins and herbal tones. Full bodied, its sinewy structure suggests it would benefit from more time in bottle; cellar through 2022."
Merriam,Sauvignon Blanc,86.67,20.0,3,"Very concentrated purple flowers aromas of violet and lavender are tough to crack at this early age, with pressed olallieberry, menthol and a forest floor tartness on the nose as well. The palate is quite tight, with espresso, underripe elderberry and plum-skin flavors, but the incredible energy and slight gamy character keeps it quite intriguing."
Merrill Cellars,G-S-M,83.0,29.0,1,"This is a blend of two-thirds Merlot topped off with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Mocha, raspberry and high-toned herb and spice aromas lead to elegant yet rich and well-balanced fruit flavors. It's a delight."
Merrill Cellars,Pinot Noir,88.0,43.0,1,"This winery has made its mark over the years exclusively with blended wines, yet here is a single-varietal, single-vineyard offering. The aromas are expressive with notes of black cherry and high-toned herbs along with spice accents. The dark fruit and licorice flavors are tightly wound with a core of firm tannins and lively acids."
Merrill Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,86.0,21.0,1,"An earthiness permeates this wine, from a wild site near the Pacific Ocean. Black tea, olive and crushed rock-influenced minerality keep it interesting as it goes, the tannins velvety though pronounced, especially on the finish."
Merrill Cellars,Syrah,86.0,32.67,3,"Soft, silky and made in a delicate style, Horseshoe is all about forested earth, black tea and truffle, a delicate lining of orange peel accented in the background. The tannins are well managed and subtle, with the right amount of oak letting the minerality of the wine speak softly but surely."
Merrill Cellars,Tempranillo,85.0,29.0,1,"This is a nicely made, full-bodied wine, richly layered in vanilla, cassis and cedar, a mix of savory and fruity. Dried herb, tobacco and oak provide a succulent backbone while the acidity stays firm and fresh in the glass."
Merrill Cellars,Viognier,87.0,30.0,1,"The first Zin reviewed from Naggiar, this is a beauty. Power and grace combine in this concentrated and well-structured wine. It smells and tastes like black cherries and blackberries with hints of cocoa and black pepper. The velvety texture delivers smoothness with a nice grip from tannins, and conveys a wonderful sense of depth."
Merriman,Chenin Blanc,90.0,23.5,2,"With a rare if tiny showing for the Blaufränkisch grape (3%), which this estate grows on their Los Olives property, this is a tangy, tart and lean Syrah, with bright cherry fruit, coffee, light menthol, tobacco and cedar on the nose. Aromatic wood flavors of pipe smoke and cigar box show on the palate, along with red cherry fruit, vanilla and sagebrush elements."
Merry Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,25.0,1,"Hailing from one of the state's most esteemed vineyards, this wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (42%), Merlot (33%) and Cabernet Franc. Jammy aromas of red and black fruit and licorice lead to plush but well-balanced flavors that linger."
Merry Cellars,Cabernet Franc,87.0,46.0,1,"Hailing from Slide Mountain and Dineen vineyards, this wine charms with aromas of flowers, toast, clove, cardamom and anise. The pillowy-feeling flavors show richness, depth and detail."
Merry Cellars,Carmenère,88.5,35.0,2,"Idaho-raised twentysomething Bret Urness is turning heads thanks to blends like this 64% Roussanne and 26% Viognier, named after hooch. It's boisterous on the nose with honeysuckle, papaya, honey and banana. These tighten on the palate to offer passion-orange-guava juice flavors that surround a tense core of herb-laced lemonade."
Merry Cellars,Malbec,90.0,46.0,1,"This wine is both fruity and creamy, with a profile that's heavy in tropical peach and vanilla. Medium-bodied and bold, it has a softness to the palate buoyed by natural structure and length."
Merry Cellars,Merlot,86.33,31.33,3,"It would be all too easy to write this off as minimally ripe and sharply herbal, as it first appears. But with extensive aeration it blossoms into a wealth of detailed flavors—bright raspberry, tart citrus and fresh herb, all with impressive length."
Merry Cellars,Mourvèdre-Syrah,87.0,38.0,1,"Sourced from vines that date back more than 100 years on the Beatty Ranch, this wine is appropriately robust, a big, syrupy concentration of baked blackberry and plum. Soft in tannins and structured, it finishes with a complexity of vanilla and black cherry."
Merry Cellars,Red Blend,86.0,30.0,1,"Smooth and seductively intense, this wine offers rich layers of black cherry and blackberry that lengthen on the palate, buoyed by soft tannins. An earthy sublayer keeps it complex and compelling."
Merry Cellars,Syrah,86.0,42.0,1,"Don't be fooled by the low alcohol, this little Pistoleta packs a high caliber punch. It's a full throttle blend of Viognier, Roussanne, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc, bursting with ripe flavors of apples, peaches and pears. It's nicely rounded out with a finishing flavor of butter cookie."
Merry Cellars,Sémillon,91.0,18.0,1,"A blend of two-thirds Grenache, the rest a mix of Mourvèdre and Syrah, this demonstrates the spicy cherry appeal of the main grape. Apple and plum flavors come into play as well, keeping the wine fruity, forward, spicy and flavorful."
Merry Edwards,Chardonnay,91.5,60.0,2,"Designed as a forward, easy-drinking blend, this youthful and spicy wine offers plenty of tart, brambly fruit and a peppery herb note in the background. Syrah, Sangiovese, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot are all in the mix, and the once-used French and American oak barrels add some further flavor interest."
Merry Edwards,Pinot Noir,93.33,65.86,21,"A Cinsault-Counoise blend, this is grapey, tasting of just-ripe berries. The flavors turn a little slender on the midpalate, but it's a pleasant quaffer with balanced tannins."
Merry Edwards,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,45.0,1,"The excellent Les Collines Vineyard usually delivers more depth of flavor than this, but a cool vintage may be the culprit. Very light berry flavors, a wash of cement-like mineral and earthy tannins with an herbal edge sum up the flavor profile."
Merryvale,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,187.5,2,"This is a medium-bodied Merlot, with dark fruit flavors that are cloaked in chewy, chalky, earthy and herbal tannins."
Merryvale,Chardonnay,93.0,65.0,1,"The mighty Insignia shows a vibrancy of purpose and craft in this, its 40th vintage, combining 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Petit Verdot, 3% Merlot, 3% Malbec and 1% Cabernet Franc. Together they find a higher calling of perfumed violet, dark plum and berry along with graphite and an edginess of dried herb. Firm, structured tannins show tremendous potential for aging and decanting. This is a near-perfect effort from a blockbuster vintage."
Mersenne,Cabernet Franc,90.0,55.0,1,"It's hard to overstate how deliciously irresistible this wine is, a celebration of the variety that makes a statement of greatness from the first sip to the last. Golden-hued minerality is the star and pillar of support, a worthy dance partner to the twirls of lacy lemon pith, fully expressive tangerine, grapefruit and stone. Lively and complex, it showcases beauty in a glass."
Mersenne,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,59.0,1,"This wine is aromatically brooding but precise, with notes of umami, black olive, smoked ham, crushed violets, funk and peat. The flavors are hefty and concentrated—with notes of fire pit and wet stone—while showing earth-shaking depth and intensity. The finish stretches out as long as you care to count. This is a complete knee buckler."
Mersenne,Pinot Noir,93.0,43.0,1,"Fresh and tart wild cherry and crushed cranberry meet with intriguing touches of fennel frond, mustard, rose hips, potpourri and tons of garrigue on the nose of this bottling. The palate packs vibrancy into each sip, redolent with flavors of tomato leaf, cherry tomato, kalamata olive, underripe raspberry, anise, bay leaf and even earthy mugwort. It conveys an extreme sense of place."
Mersenne,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,26.0,2,"This wine opens with aromas of earthy funk, steak tartare, potpourri, pepper and earth, showing outrageously minerality. The flavors are dense and textured, leaning hard into the savory with abundant flower and fire pit notes that linger effortlessly. It's a very cerebral wine but with no shortage of hedonism."
Mesa Del Sol,Red Blend,87.0,32.0,1,"Hearty plum, deep rose petal, earthy juniper, a touch of charcoal and crushed graphite aromas show strongly on the nose of this bottling from a tiny block in this historic vineyard. The palate packs an awesome combination of tension, energy and power, like a clenched fist in a silk glove, with tangy olallieberry fruit and a menthol character that carries deep into the finish."
Mesa Del Sol,Zinfandel,92.0,30.0,1,"The aromas are perfumed and expressive, with notes of crushed flowers, brown stems, black olive, sea salt, smoked meat and funk. The flavors are dense and intense, but still with a silky feel. It's a classic example of this producer, with a finish that just won't quit."
Metaphora,Cabernet Franc,88.0,60.0,1,"This is a decidedly beautiful wine, a carefully crafted offering of Tahitian vanilla bean, caramelized apple and juicy peach that is integrated and buoyant in acidity. It continues to open and shine in the glass, getting better as it travels along the palate, with a lush finish of preserved lemon that just sings."
Metate Hill Vineyards,Albariño,87.0,24.0,1,"What a powerfully lovely, lilting and blockbuster of a wine this is. Seamless in baked rhubarb and a velvety texture it never stops impressing, allowing for nuanced explosions of black cherry and Asian spice to coat the palate and become more complex the longer each sip lingers. Deliciously drinkable now, the wine will take on additional wow factor over time."
Methven Family Vineyards,Pinot Gris,86.0,21.0,1,"Out of the gate this wine reveals quite savory aromas of stems, fire pit, soot, black olive and light flowers. The flavors are intense and tightly wound, showing a lot of structure along with elegance. It's a flat out stunner, showing grace and power as well as a hyper-extended finish."
Methven Family Vineyards,Pinot Noir,87.0,50.0,2,"A compelling wine, this begins as a journey into salted country butter, lemongrass and a hint of sea-spray-like brine. Lengthy and spicy, it possesses a great deal of stony minerality that gives it length, breadth and brightness, a vinous come-on to have more."
Mettler Family Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.8,25.0,5,"From an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria, this bottling kicks off with peppery spice on the nose along with strong black olive, bay leaf, dill and a black-raspberry element on the edges. Lively underripe fruit tones power the palate, as does Kalamata olive, North African spice, coriander and tomato leaf."
Mettler Family Vineyards,Petite Sirah,92.33,25.0,3,"Stark minerality, from hot gravel to chipped slate, meets with garrigue elements of lavender and thyme on the nose of this strong bottling that gains a savory quality thanks to roasted-pork aromas. The requisite fruit arrives on the sip, where smashed cranberry meets with pepper spice and dried herbs. The structure is grippy and affords great length in the finish."
Mettler Family Vineyards,Zinfandel,87.17,20.0,6,"A firm and focused Cabernet Franc, with just 5% Merlot in the blend, this spent 18 months in 50% new American oak. It's a straight-ahead style, with a red berry flavor and polished, proportionate tannins."
Metz Road,Chardonnay,92.0,29.0,1,"The Pommard clone gives a distinctive taste of breakfast tea to the wine, with fresh raspberry fruit and a lick of lemon. It's nicely astringent but smooth and well structured, with light touches of frangipane."
Metz Road,Pinot Noir,91.5,34.5,2,"A small, husband-and-wife project inspired by the late Greg Brown of T-Vine Cellars, who made some mighty fine wines in his day, this wine is waxy in plum and blackberry, fruity yet possessed of equal parts cedar and herb. Full bodied, it retains plenty of acidity, balanced in approach and price."
Metzker Family Estates,Chardonnay,95.0,65.0,1,"Pretty notes of black-cherry blossom and fruit are bolstered by black pepper, dried violets, deep red roses and a touch of cinnamon on the nose of this wine from the region's most famous vineyard. It presents a hearty, earthy style on the palate, with anise, bay leaf, black tea and coffee flavors that spice up the dense elderberry and strawberry fruit."
Metzker Family Estates,Pinot Noir,92.0,55.0,1,"Thick, concentrated, almost syrupy aromas of blueberry, fudge, espresso and a splash of crème de menthe show on this attention-grabbing bottling of 61% Petit Verdot, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon and 18% Merlot. The palate is happily not as thick as expected, offering dark chocolate, minty licorice and espresso flavors, leaving a menthol zing on the tongue into the finish."
Meyer Family Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.33,49.0,3,"A suggestion of minty eucalyptus makes itself quietly known on the entry of this wine, followed by soft, seamless layers of rich red cherry. Floral and bursting in elegance, it's a vibrant, worthy representation of the vineyard. Sadly, this is the last vintage from this producer from this site. Drink now through 2020."
Meyer Family Cellars,Syrah,89.0,42.0,3,"Of the winery's two reserves, this is the darker in terms of both fruit and barrel flavors. Well-ripened cherry fruit fills the mouth, and leads into a full-bodied, resonant finish with highlights of toasted coconut. This delicious, well-balanced wine spent 10 months in new French oak."
Michael David,Cabernet Franc,87.5,35.0,4,"This perfectly embodies the fruit-forward, irresistibly delicious wines of the 2012 vintage in the Willamette Valley. Along with lively aromas of pepper and spice come brambly fruit flavors of just-picked raspberries and black cherries. It rolls into a lush finish with a streak of espresso."
Michael David,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.17,40.5,6,"Elegant and complex, this conjures up scents and accents of breakfast tea, black cherry, cassis and cut tobacco. It's tart and sappy, with youthful verve and refreshing acidity. Drink now through 2025."
Michael David,Cinsault,90.2,24.8,5,"Lush, aromatic and focused, this was barrel-fermented in 25% new French oak. It's balanced and built to age, with flavors of apples, roasted hazelnuts and a touch of buttered popcorn. It finishes with energizing minerality."
Michael David,Petit Verdot,88.5,35.0,2,This Pinot is from the winery's only Eola-Amity Hills AVA vineyard. The palate brings distinctive herbal accents around brambly berry-fruit flavors. Rich seams of caramel and chocolate smooth the finish.
Michael David,Petite Sirah,90.75,22.0,8,"Created jointly by a chef, a sommelier and a wine critic along with winemaker Jarrod Boyle, this appealing blend of Syrah, Grenache, and Counoise is loaded with rich, sweet cherry, blackberry and cola notes with a full-bodied, satiny mouthfeel and a lingering finish."
Michael David,Red Blend,87.4,18.0,5,"Aged in stainless steel, this single-vineyard Viognier is aromatic and appealing, with notes of fresh flowers, peach and lees. It's off-dry, medium bodied, with a textured feel and light fruit flavors."
Michael David,Syrah,90.33,16.0,6,"A very different composition from the 2007 Les Chevaux, this year's blend is 34% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah, 8% Cabernet Franc and 8% Malbec. It's a tannic wine, and seems to put a lot of emphasis on the vanilla/tobacco flavors that characterize so many blended reds these days. Fair value, but somewhat generic."
Michael David,Tannat,88.0,35.0,1,"Yorkville has been making this blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc (for this vintage it's 60% the first and 40% the latter), for many of its 25 years, and it achieves a nice balance, the Sémillon there for richness, texture and color, the SB for acidity and the wine's citrus and herb finish. Made from organic grapes."
Michael David,White Blend,86.0,18.0,1,"This is made from declassified barrels originally intended for Stevens 424. It's sharp-edged and spicy, not yet wellintegrated, but substantial, with wild berry flavors and slightly green tannins. A good quaffer, or pair it with a flank steak."
Michael David,Zinfandel,87.2,52.4,5,"Klipsun vineyard grapes are fermented in stainless steel to produce this crisp and refreshing Sauvignon Blanc. In 2010, a cool vintage even at this Red Mountain site, the grassy side of the grape is in the spotlight. A little sweatiness blows off with airing, then the lemongrass and light melon flavors come through, with plenty of acid backing."
Michael Florentino,Monastrell,87.0,28.0,1,"In this straightforward quaffer, aromas of pear, melon and apple lead to off-dry fruit flavors with a full feel. The flavor concentration is light but it still provides easy drinking enjoyment."
Michael Florentino,Mourvèdre,91.0,25.0,1,"Bright copper in color, this substantial wine offers light strawberry and plum aromas, ripe plum and pear flavors and a creamy texture. Fruit flavors come out and linger on the taste buds with the help of the soft texture and somewhat sweet finish."
Michael Florentino,Red Blend,88.0,22.0,1,"Pear, dried flower and ripe green apple aromas lead to lighter-styled, dry, mouthwatering stone-fruit flavors. This brings interest but the concentration doesn't seem all there."
Michael Florentino,Rosé,85.0,15.0,1,"Half Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Merlot along with just a smidgeon (6%) of Syrah, this wine provides aromas of smoke, plum, herbs and black currant. The flavors are broad and generous, with an appealing texture and a finish that lingers."
Michael Florentino,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,85.0,20.0,1,"High-toned and 100% varietal, this ephemeral Pinot Gris was aged in stainless steel and is dry and waxy on the palate. Crisp green apple and lemon flavors are complemented by a mineral underbelly that makes this a food-friendly wine."
Michael Gill Cellars,Syrah,92.0,70.0,2,"This saignée blend of Grenache and Syrah offers buttered strawberries and cherry juice on the playful and fun nose. There's a touch of effervescence on the lively, acidic palate, with flavors of berry-spiked lemonade and watermelon bubble gum."
Michael Gill Cellars,Tempranillo,92.0,42.0,1,"Coming from vineyards scattered across the Wahluke Slope, this immediately charming wine has aromas of mocha, coffee, plum, herbs and assorted barrel spices. The sweet blue fruit flavors are soft and bring plenty of appeal."
Michael Mondavi Family Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.33,91.11,9,"A unique blend of Pinot Gris, Muscat, Riesling and Gewürztraminer, it is—as its name suggests—quite floral, along with notes of lychee and white grapefruit. It drinks off dry, with a medium-bodied feel. Citrus and spice flavors carry through the finish."
Michael Mondavi Family Estate,Chardonnay,88.67,33.33,3,"This blend contains five Bordeaux varieties with Cabernet Sauvingon (54%) and Merlot (28%) taking the lead. Cocoa, herb and plum aromas are followed by sweet cherry and cranberry flavors backed by chalky tannins."
Michael Mondavi Family Estate,Sauvignon Blanc,94.0,65.0,1,"This tart, lean wine from an Amador County winery is very dry, very tangy and very herbaceous in aroma and flavor. It will be a great choice at lunch or before dinner for people who appreciate aromatic expression and an austere texture."
Michael Pozzan,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,30.0,1,"Rosés are unusual coming out of the valley and single-varietal, vineyard-designated ones an extreme rarity. This one is pale cherry in color with aromas of spice and herb. The palate is broad and textured in feel with abundant spice and mineral flavors and a lingering finish."
Michael Pozzan,Red Blend,84.0,18.0,1,"Sweet barrel flavors set off pretty fruit, a generous mix of cherries and berries, with juicy underlying acidity. This wine needs quite a bit more time to unfold. For the moment, all the components are right but the integration is not complete."
Michael Rose Cellars,Alicante Bouschet,87.0,24.0,1,"Young and still a bit yeasty, with the flavors still integrating. The toasty barrel and bourbon flavors are matched to medium acids and stone fruits. This needs more time in the bottle to show all its strengths."
Michael Rose Cellars,Syrah,91.0,34.0,1,"A blend of almost equal parts Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, supported by smaller percentages of Merlot, Malbec, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, this is a sizable wine. A tight fist of dry wood tannins and tobacco carries a gamy, leathery touch to the finish."
Michael Sullberg,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,14.0,1,"A fragrant wine with notes of lavender, pear and peach, this drinks medium-sweet, with a spritzy feel and peach flavors throughout."
Michael Sullberg,Chardonnay,86.0,13.0,2,"Shy on the nose, this 100% Chardonnay from the winery's Vineburg and Firetree vineyards is entirely barrel-fermented and the oak shows mostly on the finish. On the palate, expect ripe pear, Good & Plenty licorice and a slight zippiness."
Michael Sullberg,Merlot,88.0,12.0,1,"An oaky, earthy aroma and lots of deep, jammy fruit flavors define this full-bodied but very smooth Zinfandel and Barbera blend. While fairly big in impact, the tannins are not very prominent so the mouthfeel and finish are gentle."
Michel-Schlumberger,Cabernet Franc,87.0,40.0,1,"From the southern end of the Napa Valley, where temperatures tend to be cool, this wine is surprisingly intense in tannin and a deep taste of coffee, rounded out by spicy red plum and strawberry. The acidity holds tight through the finish, making this a friendly food wine."
Michel-Schlumberger,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,50.0,2,"Combining rich cinnamon and clove aromas with ripe blackberry and nutmeg flavors and very firm tannins, this is a full-throttle red. A sense of concentration and focus marks the fruit notes, and all is framed by astringency that cleanses the palate. It will be best after 2016."
Michel-Schlumberger,Chardonnay,87.0,31.5,4,"This is flavorful, well-built and robust with an exotic twist to its flavors. There's a hint of mint or menthol in the aroma, lots of black cherry and dark plum flavors and a firm, tannic texture. It's deeply colored and full bodied."
Michel-Schlumberger,Merlot,82.5,27.5,2,"This is a lightly aromatic wine with notes of peach, pear and apricot along with a floral top note. It's pleasant and easy-drinking, with sweet fruit flavors softening its descent."
Michel-Schlumberger,Pinot Blanc,85.0,24.0,1,"Bottled unfiltered, this wine shows some carbonic tendencies, a wildness of strawberry punch and sharp acidity. Light bodied and restrained, it is softly layered and subtle in oak."
Michel-Schlumberger,Red Blend,85.0,75.0,1,"Oaky and buttery all the way, this unabashedly old-fashioned Chardonnay will certainly appeal to those who love that style. It's a big chunky blocky wine, with simple, generic fruit awash in oak."
Michelle,Sparkling Blend,86.67,13.5,6,"This lightly sparkling, low-alcohol wine is off dry but with bracing acidity. It features a refreshing mix of apple, peach and citrus fruit, making it perfect as a chilled apéritif, or as a mixer for a wine punch or cocktail."
Middle Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,42.0,1,"This complex, light and floral estate wine is subtle in lemon and green apple, tart without being sour. It has low to no oak imprint interfering with the freshness of the fruit and texture, the minerality lasting a long time on the finish."
Middle Ridge,Merlot,87.0,42.0,1,"Sea salt and dried honey dust season the cement and chalky minerality on the nose of this always-reliable bottling from the longtime downtown Santa Barbara producer. A nice zestiness of lime peels marks the tip of the palate, followed by a lemon-candy warmth in the midpalate, with the saltiness prevalent throughout."
Middle Sister,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,12.0,1,"This vintage marks a big step forward for this Oregon Sauvignon Blanc. As fresh and racy as a bright young Quincy from the Loire, this sappy Sauvignon has the snap of natural acidity and a tongue-tingling mix of melon, lime and grapefruit on the palate. It's drinking beautifully right now while at its most fresh."
Middle Sister,Pinot Noir,86.0,12.0,1,"From the oldest Chenin Blanc vines in the Dry Creek Valley, winemaker Leo Hansen crafts a dry, floral white with textured character and nuanced acidity that's garnished with layers of apple, herb and pear, and just a suggestion of tropical flourish on the finish."
Middle Sister,Sauvignon Blanc,85.0,12.0,1,"The Stillwater Creek vineyard bottling of Novelty Hill Syrah shows a bit more concentration than its sibling in 2011, with whiffs of pepper, earth, soy and umami. There's a saline character as well, reflective of the mineral-rich soil, and a pleasant taste of toast in the tannins."
Midnight,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.86,56.43,7,"Tart and sharply-defined, this single-vineyard effort offers edgy flavors of melon, apple, pineapple and jicama. The vineyard's signature minerality is evident as well."
Midnight,Cabernet Franc,85.0,44.0,1,"For the first time this reserve-level Gamache Cabernet includes grapes from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard as well as both the Champoux and estate vineyards. It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination. Powerful, sleek, dense and textural, the wine explodes from the glass, muscular and thick with black fruits and ripe tannins. Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish."
Midnight,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,41.5,2,"Light in oak and mid-weight all in all, this Chardonnay from a cooler sub-section of the Napa Valley is replete with baked apple veering into dried fruit character and a touch of vanilla."
Midnight,Chardonnay,87.0,29.0,1,"Grenache's essential fruity character is well-preserved thanks to the use of a whole berry press. Popcorn pink in color, it offers sweetly peachy flavors adorned by wild strawberry and tangerine. The wine light and minerally."
Midnight,Malbec,88.5,44.0,2,"Ripe in strawberry and pineapple and dark pinkish-orange in color, this is straightforward and dry. Smooth and tangy to drink, it's accented in a citrus finish akin to fresh-pressed juice."
Midnight,Merlot,87.0,36.0,1,"Fermented in both tank and new acacia barrels, there's definitely a depth of woodiness on the opening aromas. This is followed by a creaminess of texture on the palate, the taste leaning toward pear, vanilla and fresh melon. The finish is first creamy, then crisp, veering on spritzy."
Midnight,Petit Verdot,87.5,44.0,2,"Though the alcohol lists at 14.3%, this seems thin and flat. There's little depth to the one-dimensional, green fruit flavors, a hint of plastic and some burn in the finish."
Midnight,Red Blend,89.0,39.71,7,"Stiff and steely, this herbal and tannic Cabernet has an interesting dusty component like a simpler version of a Rutherford (Napa) red. But rather than developing further complexity, it quickly fades away."
Midnight,Rhône-style White Blend,87.0,29.0,3,"This is old vine Lemberger, one of the first red grapes to be widely planted in eastern Washington. It comes from a 1979 planting at the Red Willow vineyard. Raspberry and cherry fruit flavors dominate, pretty and pure, but lacking in depth. Some Lemberger can approach the style of Dry Creek Zinfandel; this is more of a simple red quaffer."
Midnight,Sangiovese,89.0,36.0,1,"This sports a smoky aroma, wrapped into tight, tart red fruits. There is an ashy undertone, and somewhat granular tannins."
Midnight,Syrah,88.0,32.0,2,"This wine is slightly spritzy and sugary, with simple yet clean apple flavors. The finish is sweet, quick and pleasantly quaffable. Best to chill it down before drinking."
Midnight,Zinfandel,91.5,36.0,2,"This has a strong start with aromas of black fruits and licorice. It's rather light in color, with fruit flavors of ripe raspberry and a little funk in the finish."
Midsummer Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.57,60.0,7,"The blend is 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot, 24% Syrah and 5% Sangio. It's a sturdy, all-purpose red, diffuse but with simple raspberry and cherry fruit as the focus of a somewhat grapey, slightly sweet core."
Midsummer Cellars,Grenache,90.0,19.0,1,"Toasted oak integrates nicely with fresh fruit aromas. The flavors are more hidden, with subtle strawberry, black tea tannins and just enough acidity making for an even, well-priced wine."
Midsummer Cellars,Rhône-style White Blend,90.0,19.0,1,"A brilliant copper color and earthy, lightly fruity flavors distinguish this dry-style, elegant sparkling wine made from 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay. It does have tasty raspberry and lemon notes, but it goes more to spicy complexity than pure fruitiness"
Midsummer Cellars,Rosé,87.5,18.5,2,"This wine, from veteran winemaker Steve Dooley, shows an herbal side on the nose, with charred pine prominent, alongside licorice and dried strawberries. The palate combines cranberry and pomegranate with healthy amounts of sage."
Mignanelli,Chardonnay,93.0,28.0,2,"Made with 91% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Syrah, this wine offers notes of dark coffee, bittersweet chocolate, barrel spices and cherry. It's supple in feel, dense yet reserved, showing a lot of elegance and restraint to the coffee flavors along with a very pretty sense of balance. Its best years are in front of it. Drink from 2022 to 2030."
Mignanelli,Pinot Noir,92.5,31.0,4,"Textured vanilla-cream and green apple appear initially in this wine, which offers plenty of weight and structure around a core of balanced acidity and fresh lemon zest. Cardamom and vanilla play at the edges alongside elements of savory brine and white flowers. The oak presence is subtle."
Migration,Chardonnay,90.71,55.0,14,"Blueberries and purple fruits get distinct seasoning from maple syrup, licorice, crushed Italian herbs and minerality in this wine from the underappreciated Cuyama Valley. The palate is quite wound up, with blueberry, black lava rocks and unrelenting herb flavors just poking out. This will unwind very nicely, so drink 2018–2028."
Migration,Pinot Noir,90.0,68.0,6,"Perhaps Temecula's future is in Super Tuscans. This balanced blend of 50% Sangiovese, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc offers a complex nose of cranberry, pomegranate, pencil lead and chocolate sauce. Flavors of hot brick, white pepper, raspberry and stewed mushrooms rock the palate."
Mike and Molly Hendry,Zinfandel,90.5,38.0,2,"Just smelling this wine—a blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Syrah and 4% Malbec—it's clear that someone gave it a lot of love and care. It offers nuanced aromas of dark coffee, dark chocolate, toasty spices and cherry. The flavors are sweet and ripe yet also well balanced, leading to a stretched-out finish."
Milbrandt,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,55.0,1,"Regional pioneer Rick Longoria delivers a savory, earthy wine from the vineyard he planted, with meaty aromas of shiitake and porcini mushrooms, black slate, cedar and fresh pomegranate. The palate is more reliant on peppery spice, rose-petal florals and dried herbs than fruit, though dried cherries make an appearance, especially on the lasting finish. It's great now, but will thrive for at least a decade. Drink 2018–2028."
Milbrandt,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.18,21.09,11,"Dense packed earth and a wild edge make for a complex experience in this vineyard-designate, from a hilltop site tended by fellow vintner and grape grower, Steve MacRostie. Blackberry, plum and herb flirt around light-bodied layers of black tea, with a finish of high-strung black cherry."
Milbrandt,Chardonnay,88.2,17.6,10,"This wine, from a label named after one of the state's wine pioneers, is Chardonnay in the traditional California style—done exceedingly well. Aromas of caramelized apples and butterscotch lead into a palate full of apple flesh, vanilla custard and sea salt, yet with enough pithy acidity to keep the mouth watering."
Milbrandt,Grenache,88.0,28.0,1,"A blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Cabernet Franc from a sweet vineyard spot near Dalle Valle, this is a lovely, softly textured wine. Shy on the nose yet powerful on the palate, it offers a burst of tightly wound tannin and leather at the fore. Chocolate and dried herb with a layering of black licorice give it a dark complexion and build. Be sure to mellow it in the cellar, through 2022."
Milbrandt,Malbec,88.0,38.2,5,"Cherry granita, black slate, rose petals and a tinge of sagey herbs combine on this single-clone study by winemaker Clarissa Nagy. The flavors are high toned, tight and quite elegant, with shaved tobacco, black pepper, and clingy acidity, before unleashing an energetic wave of espresso and orange rinds."
Milbrandt,Merlot,87.85,21.08,13,"Salted lemon rinds, ice-cold apple, fresh-squeezed lime and white rocks show on this wine by the team of Mikey Giugni (Jack Creek Cellars) and Michael Brughelli (Bien Nacido). It's tight and bitter-leaning on the palate, with grapefruit pith and Brie cheese rind, but not overly sour, with some butter emergent on the finish. It makes for a complete experience."
Milbrandt,Pinot Gris,87.0,13.0,4,"Adam Lee takes hold of one of the appellation's iconic vineyards and delivers clean, fresh aromas of mushrooms, raspberries, mocha and graphite. The palate shows soy, shiitake and more raspberry, an excellent study of the grape done in the Siduri style."
Milbrandt,Primitivo,89.0,28.0,1,"The new French oak (60%) and rich fruit aromas and flavors play perfectly off each other. Notes of dark roasted coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate meld with fresh herbs and dark cherries. It's rich and layered with abundant fruit and barrel flavors capped off by a tart, lingering finish. Best after 2020."
Milbrandt,Red Blend,88.83,40.67,6,"This light-fruited wine is the most widely available of the winery's Pinots. Its cherry and orange candy flavors give it a pleasant, albeit superficial, entry. Don't expect complexity, but for a light and accessible taste of the Willamette Valley, it's a fair value."
Milbrandt,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,28.0,1,"This is made from a majority of Sangiovese, with smaller amounts of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah. Juicy, it's soft in cinnamon, plum and dark cherry, with an oaky finish."
Milbrandt,Riesling,89.42,14.5,12,"Stone fruit-fuzz and sugar apple combine along a freeway of thick texture and voluptuous flavor in this full-bodied white, aged in both new and neutral French barrels. Creamy vanilla adds additional richness and texture as it finishes strong and ripe."
Milbrandt,Rosé,86.0,13.0,1,"This seems a bit overripe in the nose; definitely an ultraripe style, with flavors of peach, apricot and mango. Real tropical, still has decent acids, but the fruit went a bit too far, and there is a definite sweetness too, along with some breakfast toast oak."
Milbrandt,Syrah,88.62,38.23,13,"This is a reserve style wine that is made in non-reserve years. A step up from their “Umpqua” bottling, with more texture, firm fruit and it moves past light cherry flavors into some tart berry."
Milbrandt,Tempranillo,89.0,28.0,1,"The winery feels that this is their best Pinot Noir, and prices it accordingly. Concentrated and balanced, it shows some grassy flavors along with the sweet fruit. Very tannic. Just one barrel—20 cases—was made."
Milbrandt,Viognier,88.0,22.0,2,"This shows excellent focus and spice in the nose, with scents of cardamom and clove reminiscent of a good Mendocino Pinot. Plenty of flavor up front, but the wine loses it in the middle palate. It finishes with a soft, spicy, slightly banana flavor, a bit out of balance."
Mill Creek,Chardonnay,84.0,23.0,1,"Sweet, grapey fruit, plum and cherry, enhanced with peppery spice. The tannins are a bit ashy, but well integrated; with not too much oak. Overall, a balanced and elegant approach."
Mill Creek,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,19.0,1,"Strong scents of hay and grass; it's a bit like old-vine Zin but with more grapey fruit flavors. Grapey, slightly foxy, there is also some loganberry fruit, lots of acid and a good long finish."
Miller Wine Works,Grenache Blanc,88.0,25.0,1,"The instantly recognizable label, sporting a bright green praying mantis on a plain brown background, is a quirky choice for a fine, estate-grown reserve. The fruit reaches blackberry concentration, with stiff, ripe tannins swathed in dark chocolate. Hints of earth and stem fade out through a lingering finish. It's already drinking well but could be cellared until 2019."
Miller Wine Works,White Blend,91.0,24.0,1,"This outstanding Chardonnay is made from 100% Dijon clones, sourced from Lange Estate, Freedom Hill and Durant vineyards. Tasty, toasty, creamy and fresh, this is a rich, palate-coating wine with a mix of crisp apple, pear and melon fruit. The texture and depth are lovely."
Miller Wine Works,Zinfandel,91.0,34.0,1,"Stark has nailed the essence of Barbera in this wine—it's juicy, textured, balanced, fruity and yes, delicious. Awash in bright blackberry and red cherry fruit, it'll go down easy with food or without, a delightful addition to the bounty of Sierra Foothills Barbera from a Healdsburg-based producer."
Milliaire,Zinfandel,84.25,23.0,4,"Sweet cherry-vanilla rolls off the palate in this concentrated, lush and velvety Pinot Noir that offers all the aspects of classic Russian River Valley fruit. The texture is seamlessly integrated around firm, supple tannins and bright, earthy red fruit."
Minassian-Young,Grenache,92.0,26.0,1,"Deeply flavored, dense and toasty, this full-throttle bottle punches up flavors of cherries and roasted walnuts. Tannins are thick and have a hint of char, and the big flavors are all in proportion."
Minassian-Young,Syrah,88.0,26.0,1,"This blend of 43% Merlot, 28% Malbec, 14% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc is the winery's star bottling of the vintage, offering aromas of plum, leather, sage, chocolate syrup and crushed breathmints. The palate is excitingly dynamic, ranging from mocha-blackberry reduction sauce to tobacco, coffee and cassis. The tannins could use a touch more mellowing."
Minassian-Young,Zinfandel,86.75,23.5,4,"It's rare to find this variety in Pinot-heavy Russian River Valley, but this producer treats it with respect, crafting a minuscule amount of worthy flavor, the 100% Petite Sirah awash in velvety tannins that tease in coconut and vanilla. Soft oak is supported by smoky leather, chocolate and blackberry, a dustiness completing the picture."
Miner,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,50.0,1,"Concentrated and lush, livelier and better than the producer's 2007 which still needs time to develop, this reserve-level Cab with small amounts of Petit Verdot, Malbec, Carmènere and Cabernet Franc is ready to drink now, its cassis and cranberry fruit showing well."
Miner,Chardonnay,91.5,50.0,4,"This estate reserve wine has more texture and length than their regular estate Pinot Noir, and displays varietal flavors mixing rubarb, strawberry and raspberry preserves.  Some spicy herb adds life to the mid-palate, finishing with a bit of mint."
Miner,Grenache,92.0,28.0,1,"This is a pleasant bottle, with pretty varietal scents of berry, flower and light spice. The tannins are light and rather soft, and winemaker Laurent Montalieu has kept the wine in perfect balance for its modest scale."
Miner,Pinot Noir,89.5,60.0,2,"The Red Hills Estate bottling sends a spicy note sailing out of the glass, with a pleasing follow-up of red currant, cherry, cinnamon and vanilla. Medium-bodied and displaying a core of tart fruit, this tails off into a tannic finish that needs a bit more polish."
Minimus,Chardonnay,90.0,40.0,1,"The Stoller bottling from Chehalem shows some dark, musky flavors, with black cherry fruit wrapped around whiffs of smoke and the commonly found Oregon notes of tomato leaf and bud. Despite its immediate impact, it falls a bit light in the back end, and does not have quite enough weight to support the thick tannins."
Minimus,Grenache,89.0,30.0,1,"A very bright, citrusy Sierra Foothills Sauvignon Blanc, very fairly priced, that tastes of cool lemonade on a summer's day."
Minimus,Grüner Veltliner,91.0,30.0,1,"Sixty percent Cabernet Franc with the balance made up of Merlot, this wine saw 20 months in oak and another 12 in bottle prior to release. The notes of dark flowers, cherry, and herbs are light, with chewy, slightly dry tannins and tart acidity."
Minimus,Pinot Noir,88.0,40.0,1,"This cuvée is comprised of 43% Syrah, 40% Merlot and 17% Petite Sirah. It exudes black tar and leather, but it's more savory than fruity. Tannic still, showing off the Petite, its finish is long and lingering. This is a good pasta wine."
Minimus,Red Blend,88.0,40.0,1,"The aromas on this wine are muddled, with notes of cocoa, vanilla, black pepper, tire rubber and cherry. The cranberry and cherry flavors are medium bodied backed by dry tannins."
Mira,Chardonnay,90.0,65.0,1,"An unusual blend of Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache, this wine displays aromas of pencil lead, blackberry and coffee. It drinks off dry, with a plush feel to the fruit flavors that help it go down easy."
Mira,Pinot Noir,91.33,50.0,3,"Bright aromas of apricot, pear, lavender and jasmine capture the senses while the richly sweet stone fruit flavors also bring pleasure. The concentration and acid don't entirely match up but there's still much to enjoy."
Mira,Syrah,89.67,47.0,3,"A saignée-method rosé given three months in neutral French oak, this wine is dark raspberry in color. Vibrant and fresh, it offers swirls of spicy herb and wild strawberry, a hint of watermelon adding to its mouthwatering quality. Dry and savory, it also has some meat on its bones, a lovely go-to for meals of all kinds."
Mirabelle,Sparkling Blend,88.83,28.17,6,"Muscular in brambly black cherry and spicy cola layers, this lingers on the palate long after the initial sip. A fine example from what the Russian River Valley winemakers call the Laguna Ridge, a not-too-cool, not-too-warm section of the appellation with shallow Goldridge soils."
Miraflores,Barbera,90.5,29.0,2,"There are equal parts strawberry and earth in this Pinot, sourced from the who's who of vineyard sites in Russian River, including Toboni, Hallberg, Floodgate, Rochioli and Bacigalupi. The components come together in mesmerizing ways, making for a balanced and restrained Pinot that's fresh in strawberry and cherry as well as seasonings of herb and cinnamon spice, building power as it goes."
Miraflores,Malbec,91.0,30.0,1,"Intoxicating in vanilla and peach, the aromas telegraphing honeysuckle and anise, this balanced, dry vintage Brut from 100% Chardonnay grapes is soft, food-friendly and easy to drink."
Miraflores,Meritage,90.0,30.0,1,"Made from 90% Chardonnay, the remainder Pinot Gris, this light-golden sparkler is well-composed, with a maturity on the palate leaning towards flavors of almond and anise. Floral and creamy, it has buoyant acidity that gives an impressive lift."
Miraflores,Mourvèdre,90.0,26.0,1,"This is a fine representation of the high-quality, fruit-laden 2012 vintage. Forward and ripe, it's packed with cherry fruit that shows a bit of candy at its center, then rolls into a lingering finish with hints of spice and caramel."
Miraflores,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.67,29.33,3,"This is a good example of what Finger Lakes Chards can offer: assertive, full-flavored Chardonnay flavors and layers of spice edged by a clean minerality. Balanced and offering a supple mouthfeel, the wine is both food friendly and elegant."
Miraflores,Rosé,88.0,17.0,1,"This is something you're not likely to see every day—a 10-year-old sparkling wine made from 100% Pinot Gris. Lacks the finesse and minerality of those Alsatian sparkling wines, but the flavors have been smoothed out over the years, and a pleasing toasty streak has crept into the tart pear skin fruit."
Miraflores,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,91.5,40.0,2,"This wine is straightforward in approach and uncomplicated in its light-bodied gathering of cola, pine forest and tea notes."
Miraflores,Syrah,89.0,30.0,2,"The aromas on this wine are surprisingly blue fruited for a Cabernet, followed by notes of herb, green pepper and spice. The flavors are lightly sweet, followed by a spice-filled finish. It's a straightforward quaffer that doesn't quite show its variety."
Miraflores,Tempranillo,90.0,25.0,1,"This wine is 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Nebbiolo and 22% Sangiovese. The volatiles are amped up, bringing distraction from the aromas of cranberry, cherry and vanilla. The fruit flavors are broad and drink quite sweet."
Miraflores,Viognier,90.33,22.33,3,"Restrained aromatically, this bottling shows touches of crushed lava rocks, black pepper and blackberry on the nose. Balsamic vinegar and sour cherry flavors mark the sip, with very sticky tannins."
Miraflores,Zinfandel,89.75,26.75,4,"This wine's pink color edges ever so slightly toward brown, and offers aromas of orange juice and pink rose petals. It's a tad flat on the palate, suggesting sour orange and lemon rinds, a touch of maraschino cherry and a slight baking-soda minerality."
Miro,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.33,31.33,3,"This art-forward, canned-wine project hits a bit of a freshness wall here. The wine is quite light in the glass yet full of dried and tired red-cherry-syrup aromas and an odd cola spice. The palate is somewhat viscous without being sweet, showing concentrated red-cherry flavors and clove spice."
Miro,G-S-M,89.0,18.0,1,"This medium-bodied wine has ripe plum and cherry-candy aromas. Equally fruity flavors are accented by some oak spice, with pretty good balance from mild tannins and acidity."
Miro,Petite Sirah,88.0,33.0,2,"Compactly built with dense, ripe fruit, this wine offers plummy flavors that lean toward raisiny richness amid a perfumed nose of blackberry and cinnamon. Its full-bodied boldness finishes dry and dull."
Miro,Pinot Noir,88.5,32.0,2,"Spice rules this pure, estate-grown Syrah, which boasts a classic nose with streaks of compost, cured meats and oolong tea. Though the stem and herb flavors are abundant, they are swaddled in ripe black  fruits and highlighted with licorice and coffee grounds from 22 months in barrel."
Miro,Zinfandel,89.67,31.33,3,"Only estate-grown grapes go into this blend that's one third each Cab Franc and Merlot, plus one third a mix of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. It's already drinking well, with super fruit concentration bringing raspberry, blueberry and cherry together in a wine finished with luscious chocolaty oak flavors. Smooth and forward, it gathers itself and focuses through an engaging finish."
Mirror,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,95.0,2,"Most of the fruit for this wine comes from this vineyard's 1975 plantings. It brings nuanced aromas of pear and mineral, drinking just a hair off dry, with more than ample acidity to balance out the fleshy flavors. The finish lasts a long time."
Mirror,Chardonnay,88.0,45.0,1,"Plump mulberry, asphalt, lavender and cola aromas power the good though slightly curious nose on this wine from a renowned vineyard. The distinctive palate is very aromatic and violet-like, with strong fennel elements alongside boysenberry and herb-laced cherry cola flavors."
Mollie,Chardonnay,94.0,30.0,1,"Copper-pink in color, this lively, fuller-bodied style rosé is from 100% Pinot Noir, picked specifically for the style, then given time to ferment in stainless barrels and neutral French oak. Intense acidity gives a sizzling quality on the palate, with biting flavors of strawberry and watermelon."
Mollie,Pinot Noir,93.5,36.0,2,"White peach cooked in browned butter, sea salt and apple slice aromas make for a delicious entry into this bottling from one of the few estate wineries in the appellation. Spiced apple and lemon salt flavors combine for a solid and ever-reliable palate, while a fresh-rain-on-cement accent adds interest and depth."
Monochrome,Chardonnay,90.0,50.0,1,"Made with 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 14% Cabernet Franc from one of the state's top vineyards, this wine displays aromas of mocha, herb and dark cherry. The coffee and cherry flavors show a mixture of fruit and barrel (72% new French) that carries through the finish."
Monochrome,White Blend,91.67,40.33,3,"The Niven family's winemaker, Christian Roguenant, teases smoked meats, blackberry paste, dark slate, aromatic red cherries and concentratied hibiscus from the nose of this wine. The palate shows plenty of ripe, red fruit, but is made interesting by woody herbs, including oregano and marjoram."
Monogamy,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,13.0,1,"Half Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this Rocks District wine offers appealing aromas of tobacco, milk chocolate, herbs and plum. The flavors have an elegant styling but still have plenty of depth with firm tannins backing them up. It will be best after 2018."
Monte De Oro,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,75.0,3,"Half of the fruit for this wine comes from Celilo Vineyard and half from Gamache. Light cloudy in appearance, it displays aromas of prickly pear, mineral, toast and lees. It's sleek with a lightly creamy feel."
Monte De Oro,Red Blend,85.5,42.75,4,"This wine needs time to open, but when it does it reveals smooth, thick oakiness on the palate that settles into a complementary note to the spicy clove and cherry vanilla. Medium to fuller-bodied in style, it finishes softly."
Monte De Oro,Syrah,88.4,65.2,5,"Austere and elegant, this wine opens in the glass to deliver fresh-cut apple, matchstick and graham cracker, balancing fruit-forwardness with complexity. From an estate property with only two acres planted to the variety, the rest to Pinot Noir, it exudes its Middle Reach roots, ripe and fresh, and entirely aged in stainless steel."
Monte Ferro,Chardonnay,90.0,15.0,1,"Barrel spice, pineapple, butterscotch and candlewax aromas are followed by full-bodied tropical-fruit flavors. It displays a lot of richness but retains its sense of balance."
Monte Ferro,Pinot Noir,88.25,24.0,4,"This blend of Barbera, Petite Sirah and other red varieties tastes hearty, fruity, full flavored and full bodied, without being too tannic to enjoy easily. Aromas like blackberry jam and flavors reminiscent of dark plum and spicy, smoky oak make it tempting and delicious. Enough fresh acidity keeps it balanced."
Monte Smith,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,22.0,1,"A blend of Viognier and Roussanne, this warm-vintage wine offers aromas of toast, ripe peach, pineapple, almond and barrel spices. It's full bodied with rich, sweet fruit flavors that stick around on the finish."
Monte Smith,Pinot Noir,91.0,28.0,1,"This shows a brownish cast to the garnet color, then reveals wonderful aromas of dried cherry and forest floor. These partner with a firm, dry and appetizing texture and lean but bright cranberry, black tea and cardamom flavors."
Montemaggiore,Syrah,91.5,38.0,2,"Quickly becoming one of Adelsheim's most important vineyard designates, this beautifully balanced wine opens with pungent, primary fruits, a jumble of berries and cherries in the nose and mouth. It lengthens into raspberry compote complexity, limned with dark chocolate and highlighted with peppery greens."
Montemar Wines,Grenache,93.0,48.0,1,"This wine delivers on richness of flavor without being overwhelming or overdone. Refined in soft tannins and a core of expressive, juicy blue and black berry fruit, it is seductive and smoky on the finish, sourced mainly from vineyards in the Dry Creek Valley."
Montemar Wines,Pinot Noir,91.25,47.0,4,"Coming from one of the few vineyards between the coastal town of Cambria and Paso Robles, this brooding wine offers dark and dank aromas of black dirt, slate, charred meat and very black cherry. Once sipped, sagebrush and lavender herbals emerge, along with sour cherry. A promising effort for an area that may be its own appellation one day."
Montemar Wines,Syrah,88.67,38.67,3,"The winery once made 30,000 cases of Chardonnay. With this release, it micro-sized that number down to 1,250, focusing on 30 vine rows to make a better wine. Mission accomplished—this medium-bodied wine offers a creamy texture, with concentrated fig and pear flavors around a mineral-laden finish."
Montevina,Barbera,89.0,10.0,2,"Extended time in all new French oak barrels give this wine a heartier feel than it might otherwise have, swirls of oaky caramel and toast most prominent on the nose and initial palate. A richness of color also stands out, while velvety tannins and red fruit complete the experience. Letting the wine open helps temper its size, revealing a measured level of refinement."
Montevina,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.5,11.0,2,"This 100% Syrah is abundant in juicy blue and black fruit, with concentrated layers of meat and leather wrapped around its intense core. Ready to enjoy now, it's ripe yet balanced."
Montevina,Chardonnay,86.0,10.0,2,Crisp pear and citrus fruit gets almost aggressively tart in this stainless-steel fermented Chard. Good length; should pair well with oysters on the half-shell.
Montevina,Merlot,89.0,10.0,1,"Very crisp, and loaded with tart green apples and lemons, this would be an ideal match for light fish or shellfish dishes. This is what unadulterated cool-climate Chardonnay tastes like."
Montevina,Pinot Grigio,87.5,10.0,2,"The aromas bring to mind buttered cashews and pears poached in vanilla syrup. The flavors follow suit, in a medium-bodied wine that's soft and easy to drink but tails off a bit on the finish."
Montevina,Red Blend,88.0,12.0,2,"The dominant aromas are smoke, toast, and cinnamon, which ride over tart-cherry fruit.  Turns quite stemmy and tough on the finish.  Drink young--with a piece of rare beef to help tame the tannins."
Montevina,Zinfandel,87.5,9.0,2,"Bright cherry aromas and flavors.  Light and easy to drink, with a bit of green stemminess on the finish that adds character."
Monticello Vineyards,Cabernet Franc,90.0,42.0,1,"Loaded with new oak, which in this case means it's cedary and very mentholly,  Under that is some tobacco and coffee.  Very drying tannins clamp down on the finish."
Monticello Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,45.0,1,"With 20% barrel fermentation, this wine is surprisingly rich and spicy for a low-end Chard. The aromas and flavors bring to mind pears and golden-delicious apples, before turning tart on the finish."
Monticello Vineyards,Chardonnay,85.0,35.0,1,"A juicy, ready-to-drink Merlot for this evening's dinner table. Sweet black-cherry fruit is accented by just a dash of sweet peppers."
Monticello Vineyards,Merlot,92.0,35.0,1,"Sophisticated and subtle, this lovely wine expresses varietal elegance, with a bouquet of roses and raspberries to begin. The jumble of pretty fruits is framed with citrus peel and a dusting of chocolate."
Montinore,Gewürztraminer,87.0,9.0,1,"This block selection is supple, almost silky, and coats the palate with lip-licking cherry-fruit goodness. Streaks of hazelnut and nougat extend the finish. This delicious wine spent 15 months in 50% new French oak."
Montinore,Pinot Noir,85.5,36.33,6,"This wine has gorgeous, obvious cedar and toasted-bread aromas. Oozing with fruit and oak richness, it tastes like blueberry syrup and cocoa. Very full bodied, it wallops the taste buds, weaves around the mouth and lingers on the finish."
Montinore,Riesling,90.0,16.0,1,"This vineyard is often featured in designate bottlings from some of Oregon's best producers. Here the black fruits impress immediately, with dense and powerful black cherry and cassis flavors. At first tight and slightly chalky, this wine responds very well to aggressive aeration, and the AVA's typical minerality emerges."
Montinore,White Blend,87.0,16.0,1,"One of the more anticipated alternative whites from Santa Barbara County each year, this wine shows light honey brittle, sour tangerine and a touch of sour cream on a bright and lithe nose. The palate offers delicate cherimoya and soft nectarine fruit cut by lime juice and orange rinds, proving light but bursting with energy and flavors."
Montoliva,Red Blend,83.5,15.0,2,"Situated in the McMinnville AVA, this vineyard delivers a sleek, well-proportioned wine. Though tight and unyielding at first, it is aromatically promising, with a mix of rose petals, berries and chocolate. Those flavors expand as it breathes open, finishing with the AVA's characteristic gun-metal minerality. Drink 2018–2028."
Mooney Family,Pinot Noir,91.75,65.0,4,"From a winery atop Summit Road between Santa Cruz and San Jose comes this wine with a hefty, rich nose of fresh-pressed raspberry, black plum and strawberry notes, boosted by Dr Pepper and light licorice spice. Notes of nutmeg and allspice mix with juniper, dried plum and boysenberry on the lush palate."
Morell-Peña,Chardonnay,91.5,45.0,4,"The color is light, which is natural for the variety, while aromas are lightly fruity, earthy and tobacco-like. Bright raspberry and cranberry flavors come with cedar and dried-herb accents that add complexity. It's medium bodied, well balanced and light in tannins, with a very appetizing texture."
Morgan,Chardonnay,90.43,30.29,7,"Bright, tart fruit conjures up fresh raspberries and cranberries, with potent acids and light hints of metal shavings and dried leaves. A lovely wisp of cinnamon toast elevates the finish."
Morgan,Pinot Noir,91.7,49.3,10,"From a relatively cool hillside site within the Oak Knoll District, this wine dances in lemon and green apple, completely crisp atop a fuller-bodied style embraced in oak. Luxurious on the palate, it finishes with a bite of salty brine."
Morgan,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.5,18.0,4,"The 2006 Zachary's Ladder is 65% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot. Beautifully defined, sharp and tight. Still compact, dense, hard and young, but loaded with mixed flavors of black cherry, iron and rock. The tannins are tough and hard, the wine is firm and focused."
Morgan,Syrah,90.0,22.0,2,"This wine offers a full-bodied lushness on the palate and a mix of preserved lemon and dried herb flavors that veer tart against the riper backdrop of sweet, peach-like fruit."
Morro Bay,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,12.0,1,Earthy spice and forest floor notes are kept fresh by vibrant acidity in this full-bodied estate wine. Black tea and herbal flavors dominate the finish.
Morro Bay,Chardonnay,88.0,11.0,1,"Made in tiny quantities, this reserve-tier wine is smoky and robust in black cherry and vanilla flavors, supported by a density of oak."
Morro View Winery,Grenache Blanc,89.0,24.0,2,"Nutty with baked peach and pineapple notes, this wine is medium-bodied but surprisingly restrained on the palate, nearly unresolved. It grows more citrusy in the glass, with a spark of lemon zest on the finish."
Morse,G-S-M,85.0,24.0,1,"This is a big tannic rustic wine, loaded with dark, bitter flavors. Cassis, espresso, smoke and charred earth all combine to carry through an astringent, tannic finish."
Morse,Mourvèdre,89.0,25.0,2,"A barely ripe blend of Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Riesling and Gewürztraminer, this has strong scents and flavors that combine in a rather strange way. Perfume, breath mint and tanned leather elements pile on, without really melding or enhancing one another. Whatever it is, it's not dull."
Morse,Muscat Blanc,89.0,18.0,1,"Light aromas of lemon peel, yellow pear and lemongrass make this an appealing option for pairing with Asian food of all kinds. The palate shows fresh lemon, lime peel and yellow grapefruit touches, along with a wet clay element."
Morse,Rhône-style Red Blend,85.0,22.0,2,"Late-picked, 100% Cabernet fruit from an iconic Red Mountain vineyard; hence the name, which translates as “the beast”. It's jammy and ripe, but the tannins have been tamed, and the fruit is front and center, along with brown spices and toasty barrel notes. This is a thoroughly delicious wine that seems to be drinking in its prime, though it shows no sign of tiring."
Morse,Syrah,89.75,25.0,4,"Fermented in neutral Burgundian oak, this is crisp and stylish, and brings in tart Asian pear, jicama and white peach. Flavors are clean and razor sharp. No alterations, additions, or finings are employed—this is as noninterventionist as it gets."
Moscato Rubino,Muscat,86.0,10.0,1,"This wine has been in release for almost two years, but the extra time has only improved it. Nicely melding the strengths of Klipsun vineyard Cabernet and Merlot with 24 months in half new, half year-old French oak barrels, this powerful wine has concentrated cherry and cassis fruit, potent baking spices, suggestions of mint and pepper, and a host of details waiting to be noticed. A great bottle to toss into a blind tasting of high-end California reds."
Moshin,Pinot Noir,87.86,50.71,7,"Sourced from a three-acre vineyard planted in 2001, this smooth and quite pretty Pinot is round and fruity, offering lots of blueberry and raspberry fruit. It's laced together with a tight streak of coffee and toast."
Mosquito Fleet,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.5,67.5,2,"The largest Chardonnay parcel in the Thomas Fogarty estate portfolio at slightly more than four acres, this slice still only amounts to four barrels of wine. The 2011 starts with a candied, chalky smell, reminiscent of white Smarties, and the flavors lean toward cooked stone fruit, such as caramelized pluot, and charred daffodil."
Mosquito Fleet,Meritage,89.0,34.0,2,"This single-vineyard Pinot Gris is smooth as silk, loaded with fresh, well-defined flavors of melon. A touch of spring herb is delicately applied. Not a big, fruity wine, but delicious in a rather quiet way."
Mosquito Fleet,Red Blend,89.0,29.0,2,"Richly effusive, it's marked by blue and black berry fruit that's almost jammy, swathed in chocolaty toffee. The wine shows off Macchia's prowess with Lodi fruit, its acidity pert throughout, especially into the finish, which also features plenty of toasty oak."
Moss Roxx,Zinfandel,80.0,24.0,2,"Nicely differentiated from the companion Stewart bottling, this Athena is a sharp and spicy affair, with tight, tart cranberry and raspberry fruit. Native yeast fermentation and extended sur-lie aging add some snap to the finish. Try after 2016 for optimum enjoyment."
Most Wanted Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,33.0,1,"A perennial knockout, this vintage delivers as always, combining 7% Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Syrah from the estate into the mix. Altogether, it opens in a field of wildflowers aromatic before unfurling tart acidity to keep freshly layered soft, supple tannin and red cherry and berry. Sprinklings of white pepper and clove factor in."
Most Wanted Winery,Chardonnay,89.0,33.0,1,"This bottling from a winery that uses both the highest of technology and most old school of techniques is incredibly subtle at first, but then come waves of mace, mulberry, forest floor and dried shiitake aromas. The palate starts with sharper herbs and spice, from thyme to nutmeg and allspice, and then the purple flower flavors explode like a bouquet in the mouth. Elderflower touches fly into the finish."
Mount Baker,Chardonnay,83.0,17.0,2,"Dark gold in color, this is a memorably luxurious and vivacious wine, tangy in grapefruit, burnt orange and cardamom. Layered and complex, it evolves as it opens to a lingering tease of butterscotch topped in nutmeg. It is an outstanding vision of an outstanding site, a wine for the ages."
Mount Baker,Malbec,88.0,20.0,1,"Homer is the winery's top level reserve cuvée. Aromatic and complete in every detail, it opens with cinnamon and violet scents, plum and cherry fruit soaked in mocha chocolate and the density and complexity that only the finest Pinot Noirs attain. Drink with pleasure now through the 2020s."
Mount Baker,Petit Verdot,82.0,20.0,1,"Winemaker Bradley Brown manages to capture all of the redwood forest-like spice of this region in his lithe bottlings. This one offers fresh pomegranate and rose petal on the nose, plus woody touches of sandalwood and cedar. Bright acidity kicks off the sip, dropping into pencil shavings, thyme and cola, with dried raspberry fruit that runs from end to end."
Mount Baker,Riesling,85.0,15.0,1,"If anyone can elevate Oregon's already excellent Chardonnays to the next level, it's Jacques Lardière, who makes Résonance for Louis Jadot after four decades at their winery in Burgundy. This nutty toasty chiseled wine has impeccable breeding, power and elegance. White peach, pear and apple fruit is wrapped in lush barrel flavors of caramel, buttered toast and vanilla wafer, with firm acids for a foundation. Drink now and on through 2025."
Mount Baker,Syrah,83.0,14.0,1,"These are in fact the original Pinot Noir vines planted in the Willamette Valley, back in the mid-1960s. An explosion of sensory detail quickly opens up the wine, with pollen, sandalwood, sassafras and coffee grounds. Those flavors wrap around blackberry, licorice and cola, continuing to expand and explore the far reaches of the palate. Phylloxera may soon eliminate these vines, so don't wait to acquire a bit of history in a bottle."
Mount Baker,Viognier,82.0,21.0,1,"There are excellent savory qualities to this bottling, with white pepper, charred lamb, soy and pine resin adding much intrigue to the black currant fruit. The umami character is strong on the sip, with beef jerky, black pepper and wild mushroom broth flavors, but there is also some tangy fruit as well as upright tannins that will keep this wine singing for years. Drink now–2028."
Mount Baker Vineyards,Marsanne,83.0,20.0,1,"This is a stunning, vibrantly robust and intense wine, big, bold and reductive and blended with 3% Petite Sirah. Floral aromas take on meaty, gamy overtones amidst black licorice, tar and juicy strawberry, the tannins silky and supportive and the finish leathery and spicy."
Mount Baker Vineyards,Merlot,81.0,14.0,1,"It's no exaggeration to say that the 2014 releases from Shea are the best (as an entire group) in the winery's history. Could be maturing of the vines, along with a textbook perfect vintage, but whatever the reasons, these wines are not to be missed. Floral highlights, potent ripe cherry fruit, a dusting of cocoa powder and myriad layers come together in this irresistible, impeccably balanced block selection."
Mount Baker Vineyards,Sangiovese,82.0,16.0,1,"As fabulous as ever, this brilliant compendium of nutty-toasty-buttery scents and flavors is never tiring. It's vivid, fruit-loaded and bracing. Well-ripened citrus and stone fruits come into focus, along with streaks of vanilla and lemongrass."
Mount Eden Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,65.0,4,"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling from tech power couple T.J. and Valeta Rodgers offers rich aromas of dried Mission fig, elderberry and black cherry, along with clay, loam and purple flowers. There is an impressive, almost muddy thickness to the palate, without being sweet or rich at all, showing flavors thyme, dill, mint and lavender against a core of dark red fruit."
Mount Eden Vineyards,Chardonnay,92.0,37.2,5,"Sublime and gritty in stony, gravelly texture, this wine surprises and awes in its commingling of salty lime, focused acidity and complex tones of apple, pear and fig. Medium-bodied, it unravels slowly in the glass, continuing to pursue different avenues of flavor and intellectual pleasure."
Mount Eden Vineyards,Pinot Noir,94.0,61.33,3,"This wine is a study of how to make Pinot Noir both extremely light and yet powerfully flavorful. Underripe black raspberry meets with white pepper and dill on the nose. The bright and lively palate dances across the tongue with thyme, rosemary and pine flavors against tart red fruit. It's easy to guzzle."
Mount Si,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,28.0,1,"The recent vintages from this Santa Maria-based winery of actress Challen Cates and winemaker Kevin Law are some of the most impressive wines out there. This is dark in the glass, with a rich bouquet of cinnamon-clove foam, black plum pudding and hot pastry. It hits the palate with panache and power, showing allspice, dried ginger and sharp cola notes atop rich black cherry fruit."
Mount Si,Merlot,88.0,28.0,1,"This tasty, lightly toasty wine is 100% varietal, with fruit approaching plumpness and offering mixed flavors of cantaloupe, pear and peach. It rolls smoothly into a well-rounded finish with a dash of white pepper."
Mount Veeder,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,90.0,1,"Red chewy fruit that's succulent and satisfying defines this wine that takes a straightforward approach to oak and tannin, integrating them both well. Cherry and cassis linger on the sizable finish."
Mount Veeder,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,100.0,1,"This represents a softer, more subtle side of the variety, holding back on overripeness in favor of simple leather, compost and black pepper. Touches of unearthed truffle offer the wine's one note of richness."
Mountain View,Chardonnay,86.0,40.0,1,A bright copper color and tangy flavors like peach and apricot make this light-bodied wine refreshing and fun. It has a crisp feel and clean finish.
Mounts,Cabernet Franc,86.0,45.0,1,"This is rich, almost unctuous, in terms of mouthfeel. That roundness, coupled with the bright golden hue, suggest that this wine may have been barrel aged. Some aromatic traces of talcum powder remain, drifting above chunky fruit flavors of pineapple and peach. The finish is full bodied and lightly toasty."
Mounts,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,45.0,1,"Almost as deep in color as a red, this wine smells fresh and plummy, with lots of fruit flavor and good concentration. It's appealing in its richness."
Mounts,Carignane,90.0,28.0,1,"While this is 100% varietal and entirely fermented in stainless steel, it opens with a vibrant note of green apple. That apple quality gives way on the palate to light grassy peach and nectarine, finishing crisp and clean."
Mounts,Grenache,90.0,35.0,2,"Exotic aromas of cranberry, plum, sandalwood, myrrh and lavender makes for an elegant entry to this bottling by the winemaking team of Steve Fennell and Laura Roach. Layered flavors of tart cherry and pomegranate are laced throughout by dried herbs, while the tannic structure is firm but not obtrusive. Drink 2018–2034."
Mounts,Malbec,88.0,40.0,1,"From the last remaining block of a vineyard planted in 1968 by Oregon pioneer Dick Erath that's yielding less than 1.5 tons per acre, this is loaded with rose petal and cherry blossom aromas. Delicate and graceful, it offers subtle raspberry, blackberry and cherry fruit. The finish is exceptional, long and complex, with hints of coffee and caramel. Give this wine your full attention and enjoy how long it lingers."
Mounts,Petite Sirah,88.0,50.0,1,"Still quite young and showing some grapey fruit flavors, this second vintage release is bursting with purple fruit and chocolate malt flavors. Streaks of cola and a mineral-drenched finish add depth and texture."
Mounts,Picpoul,90.0,35.0,1,"This delicious, reserve-level effort keeps the alcohol low without sacrificing power, weight or depth of flavor. Barrel-fermented and aged sur lie, it's a full-bodied wine with scents and flavors of ripe stone fruit, buttered toast and caramel. Decant and drink now or cellar for a few years."
Mounts,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,35.5,2,"From the biodynamically farmed Momtazi vineyard, this adds layers of herb, pine, compost and forest floor components. Fruit is in the mix but is less prominent, giving way to those complex, earth-driven flavors, with a touch of citrus. It seems to give you more the more you give it your full attention."
Mounts,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,28.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 85% of this wine, with the balance Syrah. Bright aromas of plum, cassis, spice, herb, green pepper, blackberry bud and smoke are followed by a fruit forward palate showing a lovely sense of texture, balance and tension, with graphite notes throughout. It's remarkably fruit-filled for a wine from this region."
Mounts,Viognier,86.0,26.0,1,"Voluptuous and expansive in texture, this wine offers a wealth of honey-apple and margarita-lime flavor accented by a streak of stone. The richness is balanced by juicy acidity that lifts the experience all along to the finish."
Mounts,Zinfandel,90.0,36.0,1,"Some of the region's oldest Dijon clone plantings are in this wine, done in a firm, classy style with little new wood apparent. With its crisp apple and citrus fruit and steely edge, it delivers plenty of flavor, a long, penetrating finish and the sense that it will age nicely for a decade at least."
Moxy,Syrah,88.0,36.0,1,"Ripe and thick kirsch aromas meet with a minty chocolate lift on the nose of this bottling from one of the most important producers in Temecula, where the winery's influence is unparalleled. The warmer climate influence is dialed back expertly on the palate, allowing herb-laced black-plum and berry fruit to shine, decorated with lavender and bay leaf."
Muddy Arch,Roussanne,91.0,35.0,1,"This wine starts out quite locked up, with aromas of flowers, plum, dried herb, black pepper and mineral, showing more fruit expression than this area is often known for. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied, bringing a sense of elegance, sophistication and freshness."
Muddy Boot,Chardonnay,87.0,13.0,1,"After a faulty first bottle of this wine, the second was a revelation: sexy, polished and lushly endowed with a mix of orange, apple, pear and apricot flavors. Its texture, length and definition are truly impressive."
Muddy Boot,Pinot Noir,86.0,13.0,1,"Made from vines nearly 30 years old, this ultra-ripe Sauvignon Blanc was oak-aged in neutral barrels, and comes across with Chardonnay-like richness. It's viscous, rich to the point of liquorous—not for all palates, but done well in its way."
Muddy Boot,Red Blend,87.0,13.0,1,"Aged in 46% new American, 40% new French oak, this is predictably tannic and oaky, though smooth and showing generous fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry. It's a steak wine all the way, with some chalkiness to the tannins, though nothing that a juicy cut of beef cannot power through."
Mullan Road,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,42.0,1,"A surprisingly ripe wine from this generally cool vineyard, it shows notes of toast, buttery spice, vanilla and tropical fruit. It's medium-plus bodied, creamy in feel with a tart finish."
Mulvane Wine Co.,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,75.0,1,"This wine tames the notoriously stiff texture of the varietal with a little extra richness of fruit and a slight softening of the usual tannic mouthfeel. So it tastes generous, coating the palate with ripe boysenberry and black-pepper flavors, and finishing smooth. It's still a big wine, but won't need extended aging."
Mulvane Wine Co.,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,72.5,2,"Thick, ripe and jammy, this is an explosive wine, broadly rich and rewarding in black-cherry, berry and licorice layers of flavor. Firm, tight tannins offer structure and power, with an intriguing hint of fennel funneling through."
Mulvane Wine Co.,Syrah,88.0,40.0,1,"This wine's aromas suggest black fruit, minerals, dark plum, barrel spice and kirsch. Its black fruit flavors are sweet and sappy, augmented with toasty barrel notes."
Mumm Cuvée Napa,Champagne Blend,89.0,50.0,1,"Co-fermented with 5% Roussanne, this wine comes from Morrison Lane Vineyard. It's brightly aromatic, with blueberry jam, huckleberry and spice notes. The palate is soft and textured, delivering rich fruit flavors and a long finish that shows some warmth."
Mumm Cuvée Napa,Sparkling Blend,89.0,30.5,2,"This wine's bright aromas include cranberry, cherry, vanilla and red fruit. The flavors are tart and full, with an appealing mouthfeel and a lingering finish."
Mumm Napa,Chardonnay,90.0,44.0,1,"Crisp apple and grapefruit notes dominate the aromas and flavors of this medium-bodied wine, giving it a tangy mouthwatering aspect that suggests pairing with seafood, mild cheeses and the like. More fruit comes out with time in the glass, fading to delicious apricot on he finish."
Mumm Napa,Sparkling Blend,90.07,40.1,30,"This wine's milk chocolate, herb, cherry, barrel spice and plum aromas lead to a plush, soft palate loaded with chocolate and plum flavors. It strikes a lovely balance."
Municipal Winemakers,Chenin Blanc,90.0,26.0,1,"Light copper-pink in color, this vineyard-designate shows a wealth of peach and orange flavors that combine to refreshing effect. Lightly made in a bright accessible style, the wine offers a moderate body weight and texture that's pleasing on the palate."
Municipal Winemakers,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.67,27.0,3,"This blend of Merlot, Malbec, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon is powerful and rich. Aromas of baked black currant, vanilla and brioche are inviting, as are the palate's black cherry and cola flavors. The tannins are a tad chunky, but a grilled steak will take care of them."
Municipal Winemakers,Riesling,89.0,25.0,1,"This is a real palate-pleaser. Forward, fresh flavors of cherry and plum are accented by light herb notes and finished with a frame of chocolate. It gains precision as it lengthens through the finish, showing medium weight and enough structure to continue to drink well through 2022."
Municipal Winemakers,Rosé,88.5,24.5,2,"Here is your Pinot if you prefer elegance over power. This delicate wine opens with a heady mix of rose petals, orange and lemon peel and raspberry fruit. The raspberry flavors linger gracefully, buoyed by citrusy acidity. The length is impressive."
Municipal Winemakers,Sparkling Blend,90.0,30.0,1,"Cooked cherries in vanilla butter, just-pressed espresso, chopped dill and a hint of tar decorate the nose of this 71% Syrah, 24% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot blend from a unique vineyard atop the Cuesta Grade. Black licorice, dark blackberries, rustic elderberries and a cedar-y, asphalt-laden grip power the palate."
Municipal Winemakers,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,32.0,1,"Combining Cabernet with Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, in that order percentage-wise, this is a well-made wine. Oaky and dusty with refined tannins, its fruit brightly centers around raspberry and red currant."
Murphy's Law,Red Blend,86.0,14.0,1,"Idaho-raised twentysomething Bret Urness is turning heads thanks to blends like this 64% Roussanne and 26% Viognier, named after hooch. It's boisterous on the nose with honeysuckle, papaya, honey and banana. These tighten on the palate to offer passion-orange-guava juice flavors that surround a tense core of herb-laced lemonade."
Murphy-Goode,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.4,43.0,5,"Thick in cherry-vanilla, big oak and tannin, this vineyard-designate contains handfuls of Petite Sirah and mixed blacks that are, as the producer puts it, too long to list. Given 10 months in American oak, it offers a balance of fruit and leathery power, from raspberry and blackberry to Sunday morning bacon. Drink now through 2020."
Murphy-Goode,Chardonnay,87.0,27.6,5,"WIth cinnamon-tinged lushness on the nose, this Petite is inviting from the start. It delves satisfyingly into raspberry and blackberry flavors with bits of toast and tar, especially on the finish. Soft and layered with a tannic bite, it's ready to drink now or lay down for several years."
Murphy-Goode,Claret,88.0,24.0,2,"A crisp, linear Sauvignon Blanc, with tantalizing flavors of tangerine, that's bright, clean and easy to like. On the finish, the tangerine evolves into melon and lime.This wine will sit well on tables set for brunch or a seafood feast."
Murphy-Goode,Red Blend,84.0,15.0,2,"From the Bokisch family's splendid Lodi vineyard comes this Sonoma-made Albariño, lemony with a touch of peach that's austere in texture and body, but rich in acidity, spicy herb and pepper."
Murphy-Goode,Sauvignon Blanc,88.6,14.0,5,"The winery's first vintage of Chardonnay from this site, it doesn't quite seem to have fully ripened but still offers some enjoyment with light flavors of herbs, apple and vanilla paired with a creamy feel and a tart finish."
Murphy-Goode,Zinfandel,89.25,28.25,4,"This appealing wine offers notes of fresh blue plums, huckleberry, tire rubber and woodspice. The flavors show purity, intensity and length—a very pretty example of the variety."
Murrieta's Well,Chardonnay-Semillon,88.0,30.0,1,"This is an ambitious, Super Tuscan-esque blend of 60% Sangiovese, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon 10% and Petit Verdot. It shows woody cedar, violet flowers and dense purple fruit on the nose. Tongue-tingling acidity enlivens the palate, which offers good tension between blackberry juice and tarry grip."
Murrieta's Well,Meritage,86.0,35.0,1,"Zin fans should pick up this winery's entire range of small-batch takes on the grape, as they are all fascinating. This one is lighter in color and offers fresh blackberry and chopped black-sage aromas. The palate is very easy to sip, with salt and cherry flavors creating a food-friendly version of an often overpowering grape."
Murrieta's Well,Petit Verdot,87.0,40.0,1,"The nose begins with a smoked Meyer lemon element, but evolves into fleshier tropicality, with ripe kiwi, white flowers and vanilla. The palate begins with vanilla, but then shows ripe stone fruits that trend toward bubble gum, with enough acidity and tannic grip to keep it serious."
Murrieta's Well,Red Blend,88.0,27.71,7,"The estate vineyard, planted between 1999 and 2005, includes several different blocks, named for family members. This Pinot has a pleasing softness, entering the mouth gently with light raspberry candy flavors. The fruit is wrapped in chocolaty oak."
Murrieta's Well,Rosé,91.0,30.0,1,"Wild berries, cranberries and pungent herbaceousness characterize this Barrel Select Pinot Noir. It seems a little light at first, then gathers itself in a focused, spicy midpalate that nicely integrates the fruit and herbs."
Murrieta's Well,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,22.0,1,"A big, juicy, fruit-bomb of a rosé, this Knight's Gambit from Erath mixes flavors of rosewater, watermelon, strawberries and cocoa in a big, broad, forward, palate-pleasing wine. The pretty pink color is from skin contact with the Pinot Gris—no red wine was added."
Murrieta's Well,Touriga Nacional,88.0,55.0,1,"Cline delivers a juicy and inviting refresher here, pretty in pink salmon color and ripe in raspberry and plum flavors that flood the midpalate and finish dry. This is a great bargain sipping wine that will bring a taste of spring to your autumn table."
Murrieta's Well,White Blend,87.88,21.12,8,"This estate-grown Riesling is sourced from some of the oldest vines on Red Mountain—planted in 1975–1976. Lush and textural, it's both rich and elegant, with flavors of pink marshmallow, honeycomb, pear and meringue. It fills the mouth with pleasing confectionary flavors, fine layering and depth. Residual sugar is 13 g/L—still dry enough for most foods."
Muscardini,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.67,46.0,3,"Fragrant with scents of citrus rind, this brings a dense core of lemon, lime and grapefruit, just bordering hints of peach. It's quite dry, very fruity and substantial. It was sourced entirely from the DuBrul vineyard."
Muscardini,Petite Sirah,90.0,48.0,2,"Aged in a mixture of American and French oak (40% new), it's a palate stainer with notes of blue and purple fruit, chocolate and barrel accents. The rich fruit flavors pack a wallop along with firm tannins that lead to an oak spice filled finish. A big wine—not for the faint of heart."
Muscardini,Pinot Grigio,85.67,24.0,3,"Uriah is Spring Valley's Right Bank-style blend, with Merlot and Cabernet Franc sharing the lead. It's lively and fine-tuned, with a lovely mix of red fruits, spices, and fresh acidity. It spent 21 months in 65% new French oak, to good effect."
Muscardini,Red Blend,90.5,51.5,2,"Here is the best of the current red wine releases from Bergevin Lane, a Merlot blend that includes 5% of each Petit Verdot and Malbec. Dense and potent, it's loaded with black fruits, coffee and tobacco flavors. The wine is wonderfully rich, with excellent definition and body. Drink now or cellar for another decade."
Muscardini,Sangiovese,87.0,24.0,1,"Toast and mocha scents and flavors surround a core of tart red berries. More barrel influence comes out as the wine breathes—clove, spice and smoke—as it rolls into a tightly-wrapped, tannic finish. Give this a lot of aeration, or tuck it away for another five or six years."
Muscardini,Syrah,88.33,38.0,3,"Aged in 30% new French oak, this has brown sugar, cola and root beer notes to back up its black cherry fruit. Coelho has shaken up its lineup, made some clear improvements and kept prices in line. Drink now or through the early 2020s."
Muscardini,Zinfandel,89.0,46.0,1,"Earthy sage and black licorice invite one into this dark brooding expression of the grape, defined in exotic blackberry, black cherry and smoke. Medium bodied and softly smooth, it impresses in its brush with the dark side."
Myka,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,30.0,1,"This wine's black cherry fruit, backed by tart acidity and ample tannins, quickly emerges. Cola and brown spice hints reflect its 15 months aging in 15% new French oak, yet it fades on the midpalate as if recently bottled. As with the Carlton Hill bottling, this should benefit from an additional year or two."
Myka,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,30.0,1,"This wine's dried flower and dark chocolate aromas emerge in the glass, with brambly berry notes in tow. A well-structured effort, it tastes of tart raspberry and cherry fruit with darker streaks of anise and espresso. The tannins, though proportionate, are a touch green."
Ménage a Trois,Chardonnay,89.0,14.0,1,"This winery does an excellent job of providing a range of styles in their single-vineyard bottlings. In this case, richness is on display, with aromas of concentrated lemon cream, buttered toast and a bit of crushed chalk. Strong yellow-apple and melon flavors show on the sip as well as a jasmine and gardenia elements and a butterscotch finish. Fairly unctuous and loose in texture."
Naches Heights,Riesling,86.0,14.0,1,"A fine value, this tart young wine opens with cranberry, raspberry and cocoa flavors. It's graceful, flavorful and already drinking well but should continue to give pleasure over the next five years."
Naches Heights,Syrah,85.0,21.0,2,"Deeply colored, this bottling shows ripe blackberry pie with caramel, crushed graphite and a touch of mint on the nose. The tannins are soft but provide just enough structure to deliver lavish flavors of black cherry, beef char and cedar."
Nacina,Riesling,91.0,20.0,2,"Intensely ripe, jammy and toasty aromas and equally effusive fruit flavors make this full-bodied wine easy to enjoy. It seems to overflow with boysenberry and blackberry, and has a touch of wood smoke from oak."
Nadia,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,35.0,2,"Reduced on the nose, youthfully, the reduction blows away to reveal a fruity landscape of blueberry and blackberry that's ripe yet light. Spritzy acidity freshens a hearty body and supportive oak."
Nadia,Red Blend,90.5,36.5,2,"Broad and pleasing aromas of yellow melon, sliced lemons, white peach and apple make for a chameleon-like nose mixing ripeness with restraint. Honeydew and cantaloupe flavors make for a plush palate, quite delicious although not too flashy."
Naggiar,Barbera,88.25,31.25,4,"This is a classic style of California Cabernet that puts fascinating mint, black-cherry and black-olive flavors on a firm frame of fine-grained tannins and a medium body. It has excellent concentration and good balance. Best through 2024."
Naggiar,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.33,44.0,3,"The slow-growing trend of white Pinot Noir finally landed on the Central Coast and Coby Parker-Garcia gives it a compelling argument in this bottling. Quite clear in the glass, and maybe the slightest bit pink, this shows crisp and clear aromas of orange blossoms, poached pear, sliced lime and rainy cement. The palate is tightly wound with fresh flavors of honeysuckle and more orange blossom."
Naggiar,Cabernet Franc,88.5,25.5,4,"This is a bright, fully realized wine from the distinctive appellation: soft with an integrated approach to its use of oak. Wild strawberry, cranberry and a threading of dried herb combine effortlessly into a pleasurable whole."
Naggiar,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.5,25.5,2,"Made from estate grapes, this combines 54% Malbec with 38% Cabernet Sauvignon and smaller amounts of Syrah and Petit Verdot. Rich as cherry pie, highlights of clove and nutmeg dot the brawny, elongated tannins as the lengthy finish adds a hint of mocha."
Naggiar,Chardonnay,83.0,20.0,1,"Usually this block is at the top of the offerings from Coeur de Terre, but a leathery aroma and dried-out fruit knock it down in this vintage. Earth, cola, mint, a hint of cherry and a pleasant spiciness are also there, but the saddle leather dominates. Two bottles tasted."
Naggiar,Grenache,88.33,24.0,3,"Fermentation was done in a mix of stainless steel and French oak, yielding a soft, accessible, lightly spiced wine. Flavors mix notes of fresh cut grass and celery with melony fruit."
Naggiar,Malbec,89.0,23.8,5,"Age has been kind to this Petite, one of Concannon's smalller bottlings. The wine is noticeably easygoing with mellowed plum and blackberry fruit and tamed tannins."
Naggiar,Mourvèdre,84.5,27.5,2,"Concannon's Reserve Petite swirls in plum, dark chocolate and coconut with densely layered tannins that are expertly contained. No puckering here."
Naggiar,Muscat Canelli,85.5,23.0,2,"Due Vigne's mountain-grown Sierra Nebbiolo is savory, embellished with olive tapenade, sour cherry, cranberry and caramel, its tannins sufficiently managed to make this wine a rich, robust red with finesse. Small percentages of Barbera and Dolcetto are blended in."
Naggiar,Petite Sirah,88.4,29.0,5,"Tall Tales is a new designation for the winery's reserve Syrah. It's unfined, unfiltered and unabashed—a potent, powerful wine which teeters on the edge of bitterness. But within its compact and textural body are lively flavors of boysenberry and coffee grounds, tobacco and vanilla, cola and rock. It pushes deep into the palate and extends into a complex and long-lasting finish."
Naggiar,Red Blend,88.29,27.29,21,"This has lovely and deep black fruits, with smoke and toast from the barrel aging. There's a streak of caramel and a hint of coconut, good balance and length, and less obvious burn and astringency than the more recent vintages."
Naggiar,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.67,44.67,6,"This is finished in a dense, dark, super-saturated style, and aged in two thirds new French oak barrels. Grainy, smoky, ripe tannins wrap around deep cassis, black cherry and black olive, with occasional whiffs of truffle. For those who love a blockbuster style, this wine rocks. Just a little heat in the finish."
Naggiar,Rhône-style White Blend,85.0,32.0,1,"An elegant, supple, toasty, very tasty Cabernet Franc from one of the oldest vineyards on the Wahluke Slope. Winemaker Mike Januik carefully sculpts his flavors, running threads of black cherry, baking chocolate, espresso, loam, sandalwood, caramel and coconut through the core of this exceptional wine. Drink young or cellar and let it evolve—it's a winner either way."
Naggiar,Rosé,84.0,21.75,4,"L'Ecole is one of the three partners in the Seven Hills vineyard, and sources its grapes from some of the oldest vines. The blend includes 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc, tight and spicy at first, then opening into a deeply flavored, brambly wine with a vivid mix of berry and stone. Firm tannins anchor it solidly and the overall structure suggests it could age for at least a decade, maybe two."
Naggiar,Sangiovese,88.57,22.57,7,"It's a difficult challenge to blend six different grapes into a wine without sacrificing focus, but winemaker Rob Newsom has done a splendid job with this new vintage of Marie's View. Roughly a third Cabernet and a third Syrah, which provide a potent core of deep red and black fruits, the wine is nuanced with layers of spice, leaf, toasted grain, loam and coffee grounds. Fine acids promise a long life."
Naggiar,Syrah,87.5,29.83,6,"Baer's Arctos blend is about three fifths Cabernet Sauvignon, and here the grape shows less fat, and more structure than in the previous vintage. It's a better wine, sleek and yet fruity, with a pleasing mix of blackberry and cassis. The tannins are forceful, herbal, and sturdy, giving the finish a firm spine. The grace notes of clove and coffee and loam continue to add interest as the wine lingers through a dense finish."
Naggiar,Viognier,88.33,23.17,6,"In an effort to further differentiate the Foreshadow Merlot from the Foreshadow Cabernet, winemaker John Bookwalter has kept each out of the other's blend. This is a riveting, complex, supersized wine, with alcohol over 15% and plenty of intriguing barrel flavors. The black cherry-berry fruit is swathed in spice, chocolate, cedar and coffee, complex and well-crafted."
Naggiar,White Blend,86.22,21.11,9,"A barrel selection from the estate and Shaw vineyards, this spent a couple of years in new French oak. It shows good concentration and oak influence. Cassis fruit is underscored with vivid acidity, and the wine retains its balance through a long finish that offers highlights of smoke and char."
Naggiar,Zinfandel,91.0,22.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot split the blend with 8% Syrah in addition. The opening scents are toasty and inviting, and the wine enters the palate smooth and agreeable, with pretty red fruits. There's a lick of licorice and then the flavors seem to lighten up and finish tart and astringent. But decant this and let it breathe, and the wine can surprise with its staying power."
Namasté Vineyards,Chardonnay,80.0,15.0,1,"Sourced from an outstanding vineyard, this juicy, spicy, zesty Riesling shows terrific balance and lively acidity. A mix of peach, green apple and Key lime fruit anchors a thoroughly refreshing wine, with just a touch of residual sugar."
Napa Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,33.0,3,"A subtle style of Viognier, this has body and presence without overt fruit flavors. It soothes the palate with a creamy viscosity. Modest apple and mineral flavors interact with crisp acidity for a low-key, reserved and well-mannered personality."
Napa Cellars,Chardonnay,86.0,22.0,2,"Dust and blackberry aromas introduce this wine, which also includes 15% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc. The flavors are a nicely presented mix of cherry and plum fruit, pipe smoke, cigar ash and an earthy finish of savory herbs."
Napa Cellars,Malbec,88.0,24.0,1,"Dark golden-yellow in color, this offers tart apple and honey flavors and is light on the palate, not overdone in oak. It will pair well with seafood or bacon and eggs."
Napa Cellars,Meritage,90.0,24.0,1,"White flowers and a red apple candy reveal themselves on the nose, but the strongest aromas convey a concentrated pear-peach perfume. The palate is dominated by apple at first, but grapefruit carries the midpalate and finish, which shows good acidity and a bit of grip as well."
Napa Cellars,Merlot,90.0,24.0,1,"This red is roughly split between Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It spent time in 40% new French oak and shows density and grip. There are substantial acids, bright black fruits and a streak of black tea among the flavors."
Napa Cellars,Petit Verdot,90.0,24.0,1,"Perfumed and lovely, this hearty full-bodied wine evokes berry pie, so rich and brambly is its depth of concentrated flavor. Rapturous, it finds its savory side with an intensity of cinnamon, nutmeg and pepper."
Napa Cellars,Pinot Noir,86.75,35.75,4,"Rich and robust, this estate wine shines in milk chocolate, leather and smoky oak, its texture densely layered and soft."
Napa Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,86.67,19.33,3,"This is a fascinating wine in that it delivers all of the components of a cool-climate Syrah from what is considered a warm-weather region. Black pepper, tar, charred game, cola and lavender show on the nose, while the  palate offers roasted lamb, more pepper and crushed asphalt. It's relatively light in body as well."
Napa Cellars,Zinfandel,86.0,24.0,1,"Sanguine, with a voluptuous mouthfeel, this wine is soft and integrated in chewy sticky tannins that resolve in the glass, and dusty in dried herb. Blackberry bramble adds a fruity edge that finds companionship in the boldly etched fruit."
Napeequa,Red Blend,85.0,24.0,1,"Thickly concentrated, this wine offers a wealth of crème brûléee richness and complexity, dotted in golden honey and a twist of lime. Supple and medium in build, it integrates the oak and ripeness at its core, finishing with a brightness of acidity that refreshes."
Napeequa,Riesling,87.0,20.0,1,"Dried strawberry and prune juice meet with black spice, dust and roasted meats on the nose of this six-year-old bottling. The palate shows decent depth, from mocha and coffee to tobacco, cedar and caramel, all decorating the core flavors of black-cherry pie and bacon fat."
Napeequa,Rosé,87.0,19.0,1,"This well-made wine offers cherry pie flavors, evoking fruit but also crust, with excellent concentration and length. Despite its modest alcohol, it's a persistent, powerful rosé with enough concentration to stand up to entrées as rich as roast pork or chicken."
Narrow Gate,Primitivo,87.0,24.0,1,"More orange or lightly blush than straw-hued, this is a fine single-vineyard wine. It's bone-dry, complex and sophisticated, with persistent pear and peach skin flavors, offering more detail and less obvious fruit than most Oregon Pinot Gris."
Native Flora,Pinot Noir,91.0,56.5,2,"Pommard and Dijon clones planted in 2001 fuel this tasty wine. Its dusty plum and black cherry fruit carries a touch of dark chocolate, all framed by firm yet polished tannins. Built to age, it can be enjoyed now with a good decanting."
Nefarious,Malbec,89.33,30.67,3,"Lean and dry on the palate, this medium-bodied wine has a subtle concentration of red-fruit flavors and fine layers of mineral and spice that unfold on the palate. Grown on a pioneering property along the Sonoma Cost, it will be best after 2020."
Nefarious,Pinot Noir,91.0,37.0,1,"David and Anna deLaski planted this obscure grape on their home vineyard to honor her Austrian roots—the results are fascinating. A dark earthy graphite-driven minerality contrasts with the brighter sweeter strawberry and cherry fruit on the nose, and then the bone-dry sip pops with a candied raspberry flavor, enhanced by fennel and white pepper."
Nefarious,Red Blend,88.33,26.0,3,"This is a very fairly priced Cabernet given its quality. It's made from 100% Cab and all estate grown in the high elevations of Fair Play in El Dorado County. Oaky and smoky, it whispers of mountain fruit, with herb, cassis and blackberry highlights amid a background of savory earth. Age 3–5 years."
Nefarious,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,32.5,2,"Blended with 11% Roussanne, this high-toned effort mixes Meyer lemon and grapefruit with broader fruit flavors of pear and peach. It's got alcohol listed at 14.6%—not unusual for Viognier, but it does bring on some heat in the finish."
Nefarious,Riesling,91.0,18.67,3,"A great value from Wente, this is a layered, bright and intensely lemon-tinged Chardonnay, worth stocking up for simple dinners and get togethers where you know a lot of people will want to drink white."
Nefarious,Syrah,89.83,36.83,6,"This is unusual for a reserve, in that it's lower in alcohol than the regular bottling, and more cases were produced. The light fruits and herbs—green apple and lemon verbena in particular—are highlighted with tarragon and citrus peel. The complexity compensates for the just-on-the-edge ripeness, and time in 20% new oak adds a buttery note to the finish."
Nefarious,Viognier,90.2,19.2,5,"Juicy and soft in blackberry and black cherry, this wine is nicely resolved in terms of tannin and oak structure,. These provide weight on the back palate, with enough heightened acidity on the finish to stay on balance. Strawberry and dried herb close things out."
Nefarious,White Blend,88.0,19.0,1,"This has a light yellow color with a touch of green and a subtle smell of crisp green apples. Flavors that are richer than expected, like poached pears, butter and fig. The texture is rich, the body full and the ripe flavors linger on the finish."
Newhouse Family,Aligoté,87.0,36.0,2,"One barrel was new French oak, the other neutral. The cranberry fruit here is subdued and tart, while the barrel aging brings in popcorn, walnuts and even a trace of butter brickle. Give this bottle until 2017–2017 to open up."
Newhouse Family,Red Blend,87.5,56.5,2,"Tightly focused, as is often true of single-vineyard bottlings, this matches spicy berry fruit to light barrel flavors of milk chocolate. It's smooth and accessible, but finishes a bit short."
Newlan,Zinfandel,83.0,20.0,1,"One-third of the wine went through whole-cluster fermentation, giving an edge to a fresh herb and moist earth component. A streak of iron and a touch of licorice surrounds firm cherry fruit. It's a solid effort that fades a bit quickly."
Newsome-Harlow,Red Blend,89.5,42.0,2,"Aromas of garden herbs, cherry and bittersweet chocolate lead to medium-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins are quite firm and need some time (hopefully) to soften. The oak seems to get out front."
Newsome-Harlow,Syrah,91.0,32.0,1,"A streak of coffee runs dramatically down a tight, snappy core of citrus and berry fruit. Flavors are lightly dusted with pepper, remaining bright and precise through the finish."
Newsome-Harlow,Zinfandel,91.71,36.0,7,"There's a tiny bit of effervescence in this twist-top bottling, which shows light cola, red cherry and pencil shaving notes on the nose. The entry to the palate is soft, bringing tart cranberry and thyme flavors, with a light vanilla note on the finish."
Newton,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,190.0,2,"This light and earthy wine has plenty of fruit flavor and funky, spicy accents. Its light texture and soft tannins make it easy to sip."
Newton,Chardonnay,90.0,60.0,1,"This is a new label for King Vintners, a new division of King Estate. The wine takes an herbal path rather than putting the emphasis on juicy fruit. A phenolic edge frames the finish. Balanced and detailed, it would make a fine accompaniment to herb-grilled chicken."
Newton,Merlot,88.0,60.0,1,"This pale-copper bubbly is half whole cluster, half saignée, and finished off dry. Lightly sweet and toasty, it marries strawberry and chocolate flavors to mouth-tickling effervescence. It's simple, tasty, fresh and ready to go."
Neyers,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,35.0,1,"The mid-14% alcohol gives this wine a solid fruit core, much like a California Pinot. Cherry cola flavors hit the palate immediately, then quickly fall away. Bottle shock maybe, but the wine doesn't show the stuffing of past versions."
Neyers,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.67,71.67,3,"Borra is having fun in Lodi experimenting with both red and white blends of varieties not usually put together —here, it's 89% Viognier and 11% Gewürztraminer—with worthwhile results. White Fusion starts with a severe lemony crispness, segues into oaky caramel and finishes bittersweet."
Neyers,Carignan,89.0,35.0,2,"This wine is 63% Cabernet Sauvignon and 37% Cabernet Franc. It shows aromas of green herbs, raisinated red fruit and raspberry. The cherry cola flavors are lighter in style, with a firm squeeze of tannins."
Neyers,Pinot Noir,91.0,45.0,2,"Hailing from Conner Lee Vineyard, this barrel-fermented wine was aged in two-thirds new French oak. It has aromas of toast, char, nut oil and lemon. The flavors seem faint by comparison, with the concentration not all there."
Neyers,Rhône-style Red Blend,86.0,26.0,1,"A unique blend of fermenting orange, aging white flowers, dried apples and a musky sandalwood show on the nose of this wine. The palate is simultaneously rich, sour and creamy, with tangerine and banana flavors."
Niagara Landing,Red Blend,83.0,11.0,1,"Once again, this cuvée blends grapes drawn equally from the Ciel du Cheval and Ranch at the End of the Road vineyards on Red Mountain. Imposing minerality underscores a tight, raspberry-flavored wine that seems like it's soaked in liquid rock. A teasing barrel note adds threads of coffee liqueur and dark chocolate to the finish."
Nicholas Cole Cellars,Red Blend,90.5,80.0,2,"The Grand Ciel Vineyard seems to be coming into maturity, and this shows impressive depth and complexity. Infused with flavors of rock and light herb,with hints of stem, anise, coffee and cocoa, it nonetheless remains firmly anchored in ripe black cherry and cassis. This could easily be cellared for 10–15 years."
Nicholas Cole Cellars,Syrah,90.0,70.0,1,"Broad and earthy, with a dash of funk and a peppery lift, this grips the tongue with authority and power. It's poised and tense, as if balanced on the edge of a precipice, with the fruit, herb, roasted earth and coffee notes all tumbling around in glorious profusion."
Nicholson Ranch,Chardonnay,88.8,46.0,5,"This opens with beautiful dark fruit that's thick and voluptuous, tasting of black cherry and cassis, with excellent depth and intensity. It's sleek and supple, yet at the same time deep and polished, with impressive minerality and a note of granite-like rock."
Nicholson Ranch,Pinot Noir,88.55,58.45,11,"This soft red wine discloses pomegranate fruit and a liberal amount of Mediterranean herbs. It's light and easy-sipping, and should be consumed while young."
Nickel & Nickel,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.91,124.55,11,"A whiff of petrol leads off on this oaky, full-figured white, which is creamy and textured with a touch of sweetness on the finish."
Nicolas-Jay,Pinot Noir,94.0,90.0,1,"This is a bit thin, and mixes in a strong herbal dimension with the tart red fruit. The acids are proportionate, and the tannins carry some bitterness into the finish."
Nicora,Grenache,89.33,55.0,3,"From another of the producer's coastal estate sites, this wine is juicy, spicy and leathery—a celebration of fresh wild strawberries and buzzy acidity. Earth, rose and white pepper flavors add welcome complexity within a tightly woven frame of structure and length."
Nicora,Rhône-style Red Blend,94.0,55.0,1,"This powerful, savory bottling named for the two generations behind the family winery opens with toasted barrel and meat aromas before expanding on the nose and palate with additional black pepper and soy components. The fruit is distinctly spicy—a mix of blackberry, clove and cinnamon."
Nicora,Syrah,92.8,53.0,5,"From a vineyard high up in the appellation, this is the strongest wine in Sweetzer's current lineup. Earthy mulberry, wild mint, sun-baked soil and dark chocolate scents show on the nose. Lively dark red fruit, bay leaf and earthy garrigue qualities arise on the hearty, spicy and lovely palate."
Nielson by Byron,G-S-M,92.0,40.0,1,"This wine impresses from first sip. The addition of 20% Viognier adds violet and lilac hints to the nose. Meat and lavender notes highlight its dense midpalate, packed with flavor and gravelly texture, blanketed with tannin and seasoned with white pepper and clove."
Nine Hats,Pinot Gris,88.67,14.0,3,"In 2016, Tim Malone has cut back on the residual sugar, dropping it down to 12 g/L, meaning the wine is just slightly off dry. The old-vine flavors rock on through, delivering big bursts of honeydew, grapefruit and lime, underscored by minerals. The depth, length and succulent drinkability are sublime."
Nine North Wine Company,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.33,16.0,3,"From the fantastic mountain site and blended with 3% Malbec, this wine has a cherry-vanilla nose that leads to a meaty, substantial palate of black pepper, leather and clove flavors. Full-bodied, robust and intense, it's well worth cellaring, to be enjoyed between 2024 and 2034."
Nine North Wine Company,Petite Sirah,88.0,19.0,2,"From a vineyard in the western hills of the appellation, this wine shows lovely cool-climate characteristics without skimping on body or ripeness, expressing balance and grace. Tightly wound, it leans savory and firm, with clove, tobacco, black licorice and tomato leaf flavors and big tannins that call for further ageing. Enjoy 2023–2033."
Niner,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,40.0,2,"This wine is produced in microscopic amounts, the result of sourcing grapes from a notoriously difficult-to-farm site. It rewards in flavor: hearty cherry and pomegranate fruit, a crisp, crunchy texture, powerful tannins and oak, and an underlying minerality that presents as elusively as a cloud of fog."
Niner,Grenache,91.0,50.0,1,"Densely packed black fruit seasoned with cola and clove defines this robust, full-bodied, mountain wine blended with 8% Malbec. Spicy acidity keeps it fresh and lively in the glass, adding complexity."
Niner,Pinot Noir,90.0,65.0,1,"This is Tendril's reserve offering, better than ever in 2014. Deeply inscribed flavors of black cherry, cola and espresso come through in a textural, detailed and quite delicious wine. It's the darkest of the winery's Pinots, barrel aged for 16 months and bottle aged for another year prior to release. Toasted nuts, crackers and a dash of salt complete the flavors."
Niner,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,50.0,1,"Cassis liqueur marks this structured Cab divine in firm, lengthy tannins and a chewy grip of black licorice. Given similar treatment to the winery's other highest echelon Cabs, it has 22 months in new French oak that will help it age through 2020–2030."
Niner,Syrah,90.5,37.5,2,"Weighty and creamy in rich tones of just-picked pineapple and Key lime, this is round and expansive on the palate, with undertones of earth and herb. Complex layers of apple and almond interplay, before a finish of honey and spice lingers."
Ninety+,Red Blend,85.0,30.0,1,"Winemaker Steve Law hails from Scotland and honors his heritage with a nod to his “thirsty neighbors,” who will only gain further thirst after enjoying this Syrah. Pure to Law's cool-climate winemaking sensibilities, this offers a leathery tribute to peppery spice and bright fruit."
No Girls,Grenache,94.0,70.0,4,"This flagship effort showcases the winery's oldest block of Cabernet, planted in 1975—the first vineyard on Red Mountain. The subtle, slightly grainy and grassy nuances of old-vine grapes are here, with red-fruit flavors that are soft and delicate, yet substantial. There's a light dusting of cinnamon, a whiff of smoke and an over-riding elegance. Such old vine, 100% Red Mountain Cabernet from a great vintage doesn't come along very often."
No Girls,Syrah,93.0,71.0,5,"There is earthy darkness and a hint of the forest in this Zin, grown at high elevation in the rocky soils of the Rockpile appellation, these vines planted in 2001. The wine is magnificently structured with complex, ripe blackberry and cherry compote coming to the fore slowly and seductively."
No Girls,Tempranillo,94.5,75.0,2,"Brander's annual Bordeaux blend features 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. There is ripe boysenberry, cedar and worn leather on the nose, followed by Bing cherry flavors on the palate, where acidity and a light body combine for a lively finish."
No Limit,Syrah,91.5,67.0,4,"Principally Klipsun vineyard fruit, this is a mass of black cherry and cassis, wreathed in smoke from aging in 80% new French barrels. Great balance and length carry it through into drying tannins. A perfect steakhouse Cabernet."
Noble Estate,Chardonnay,87.0,25.0,1,"Crisp and balanced in bright acidity and apple skin, this also offers subtle toasted oak and caramel, the best of both worlds, exuberant and elegant at the same time. Enjoy now or cellar until 2020."
Noble Estate,Muscat,90.0,18.0,1,"Scents of chamomile tea with generous honey and lemon get down with white flowers and baking pie crust on this offering from Pierre Lafond, who's been making wine since the 1960s. The wine dances across the tongue, with bright papaya, pear and a dill-powered, nearly bitter finish. It's showing almost no age, so it will hold well, but it's also brilliant right now."
Noble Estate,Pinot Noir,89.0,29.0,1,"Pineapple, candied apple and a touch of guava jelly on toast achieve great aromatic balance on a rare Rancho Santa Rosa Chardonnay. The flavors are lush, not racy, and evolve in a mellow fashion, from apple to nectarine and then papaya."
Noble Tree,Merlot,83.0,20.0,1,"Made from 100% Syrah and aged in half new French oak, this brawny Syrah hails from a vineyard known for its mix of power and finesse. Sanguine and smoky, the fruit leans toward blueberry and the texture to leather, a streak of graphite in the background. Tannins are firm and sizable, with a balanced finish."
Noble Vines,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.67,15.0,3,"The Del Rio vineyard, in southern Oregon's Rogue Valley AVA, has pioneered the cultivation of Syrah in that part of the Northwest. As the vines acquire some age, they are coming into focus, and the rough tannins seem to be more in balance with the fruit. These wines are somewhat similar in style to the Syrahs from the Okanagan valley of Canada, and they offer an earthy mix of flavor that puts the fruit under earth, soy, coffee and smoke. Tannins in this Tyrus Evan are beautifully managed, with the edges sanded down, and the wine has a lovely, lingering presence on the palate."
Noble Vines,Chardonnay,89.0,13.0,1,"This is a light but classy take on Oregon Pinot, with leaf and herb in front of spicy cranberry and sour cherry fruit. The balance is fine-tuned and the wine carries the elegance of the grape through a persistent finish."
Noble Vines,Merlot,87.4,13.0,5,"This wine surprises by being so very pretty—unexpected from such a hot site. Lovely scents of raspberry, strawberry, mint and spice lift the nose; the palate is medium-bodied, nicely tart, perfectly balanced and long. The mix of sweet and tart red fruits lasts deliciously, with the spice adding grace notes. Though blended and aged in 100% new French oak barrels, the oak is muted, and the fruit shines through."
Noble Vines,Pinot Grigio,88.5,12.5,2,"The fruit is ripe and the tannins firm; winemaker Jerry Reiner is able to craft very ripe fruit while keeping the varietal character of the Cabs—earth and herb, with a touch of stem. Deep and substantial, this should age well for a decade or more."
Noble Vines,Pinot Noir,87.5,13.5,2,"Aromas of barrel toast, spice and cherry lead to a somewhat barrel-forward palate, filled with coffee and cherry flavors along with firm tannins. It drinks tight now and needs some time to unwind."
Noble Vines,Red Blend,89.0,15.0,1,"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed vineyards, Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 83% of this wine, with the balance Cabernet Franc. It brings notes of savory herb, barrel spice, flower, dark fruit and black tea. The fruit flavors are rich and well structured, with firm tannins and a sweet, spice-filled finish."
Noble Vines,Rosé,89.0,15.0,1,"Herb notes are at the fore, followed by red cherry, pencil lead and generous barrel spices on this aromatic brooder. The palate is fresh and lively, backed by firm but still well-integrated tannins."
Noble Vines,Sauvignon Blanc,89.33,12.33,3,"Ripe white peach and sharp lime peel qualities interplay on the nose of this bottling from the iconic vineyard, which is now under the quality-focused ownership of the Foley family. That lime zest comes through on the palate too, cutting through the creamy midpalate and adding a pinpoint edge to the finish."
Noceto,Barbera,89.0,25.33,3,"A spicy, earthy personality makes this wine unique, and it has a great sense of balance. It exudes cardamom, wood smoke and black pepper aromas, and the flavors follow with black plum and clove, accented by peppery spice."
Noceto,Moscato,90.0,16.0,1,"This wine is principally Merlot (58%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (17%), with the balance Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of mortared green herbs mix with anise and the blackest of cherries. The palate is medium bodied, delivering enjoyment but coming off as a bit green."
Noceto,Sangiovese,89.0,25.25,4,"Scents of rose petals and cocoa powder elevate the nose, leading into pretty chocolate cherry flavors in the mouth. It's set atop a lightly tart foundation that brings accents of oranges and tangerines, and finishes with a touch of leather."
Noceto,Zinfandel,86.0,29.0,2,"A very savory take on this close Zinfandel cousin, this bottling shows dried herb, peppercorn, forest floor and dessicated red fruit aromas. The palate is a tad riper, with black cherry and cola flavors, spiced with black pepper and more herbs, including oregano and marjoram."
Nodland,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.5,29.0,4,"Very primary aromas of lime zest and mineral are followed by lightly spritzy, just a hair off-dry citrus flavors backed by bright, tart acidity."
Nodland,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.33,38.67,3,"A rare single-vineyard rosé, this wine is rose gold in color. It offers aromas of fresh herb, citrus peel and strawberry. The palate is dry, bright and focused with lively citrus flavors that extend on the finish."
Nodland,Carmenère,88.5,25.5,2,"A hint of earthiness accents this medium-bodied, moderately tannic and berry-flavored wine. It smells savory and leathery, and tastes like raspberries and blackberries."
Nodland,Red Blend,88.33,15.0,3,"Light, oaky spices and rich berry flavors mix it up in this tangy, somewhat tannic wine. It's full bodied but the firm acidity and fine-grained tannins keep it lively."
Nodland,Riesling,89.0,18.0,2,"This 100% varietal wine sees a hearty dose of new oak and is built for the long term. It leans classic in its elegant layers of dried herb, red currant and pomegranate flavor. Boldly structured, it pleases rather than challenges the palate."
Nomadica,Pinot Noir,85.0,25.0,1,"San Francisco-based winemaker Ed Kurtzman heads to this famed vineyard south of Salinas to create this restrained bottling from a region where power and richness usually reign. Flint, Meyer lemon, honeysuckle and grapefruit aromas show on the nose. The palate offers nectarine, white peach and Asian pear flavor, proving delicate but not shy."
Norman,Zinfandel,85.0,18.0,1,"Measured acidity lifts the generous green apple, pear, key lime and nutmeg flavors in this well-crafted vineyard designate from the cooler outskirts of Napa Valley. Subtle oak and weight allow the fruit to speak, seasoned with coconut flake accents."
North by Northwest,Red Blend,90.0,15.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Grenache (44%), Mourvèdre (22%), Syrah (14%), Cinsault (13%) and Counoise. It delivers aromas of red fruit, celery stalk, white pepper and herb that lead to ripe full-bodied dark-fruit flavors that offer a lot of enjoyment."
North by Northwest,Riesling,88.5,15.0,2,"This wine has a glorious floral nose highlighted in honey and wildflowers, revealing richer gingerbread and toasted oak undertones as it opens. Its creamy texture provides a sense of unctuousness, complemented by tart green apple and lemon on the finish."
North by Northwest,Syrah,90.0,40.0,1,"This study of a low-yielding clone produced a compelling range of aromas and flavors. The nose leads with iodine, seaweed and coffee scents against a backdrop of tangy black fruit. The palate shows more nori, lavender, black pepper, asphalt and dried blackberry flavor, finishing on a lingering oaky note."
Northstar,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,29.0,1,"Big, bold and tannic, this layered and nicely ripe wine is an iron fist in a velvet glove. It smells like espresso and dark chocolate, tastes equally roasted and rich, but backs its darker flavors with blueberry and blackberry notes, finishing smooth. Best after 2019."
Northstar,Merlot,91.8,85.0,5,"This blends 64% Syrah with 26% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot to good effect, offering tomato leaf, leather, dried herb and lavender aromas. Savory, meaty and medium bodied on the palate, it pairs well with heavier fare."
Northstar,Red Blend,90.75,29.0,4,"Stonestreet consistently delivers complex, refreshing renditions of Sauvignon Blanc. Grassy on the nose, with an exotic tease of pea shoot, it seemingly vibrates on the palate with lemon, grapefruit and apricot flavors."
Northwest Cellars,Merlot,84.0,24.0,1,"High-toned citrus stars in this mineral-driven wine that harmonizes acidity and fruit. Lime and grapefruit lean into richer elements of vanilla and caramel on the finish, balancing each other out."
Northwest Cellars,Petite Sirah,88.0,32.0,1,"Crisp and high in acidity, this wine mixes cinnamon, vanilla and pear flavors, accented by a note of exotic orange blossom on the nose. With a low presence of oak and medium body, it remains fresh and vibrant in the glass, offering a hit of toast and vanilla on the finish."
Northwest Cellars,Pinot Gris,88.0,15.0,1,"Bing cherry, blackberry and hot black lava rock aromas arise on the nose of this expression of a dry-farmed vineyard. The palate is light compared to similar Zins, showing plum skins, tomato leaf and a heightened sense of minerality along with cherry-candy flavors."
Northwest Cellars,Red Blend,84.67,25.0,3,"Honey, lime rinds and just ripe peach greet the nose on this dry single-vineyard expression by Michael Callahan. The palate is extremely vibrant and citrus-driven, with a very chalky minerality and a very slightly oxidized touch of nuts on the finish. It's minerally mean and extremely, bracingly dry."
Northwest Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,24.0,1,"Here's an interesting, single-vineyard, Dundee Hills wine at a price usually reserved for blended Willamette Valley cuvées. Slightly murky and funky, it's the sort of wine you might stumble upon in some cob-webbed, Old World cellar. The primary raspberry and rhubarb tones have a peppery, lightly bitter quality about them."
Northwest Cellars,Syrah,88.0,32.0,2,"The name refers to the blend, a 50/50 mix of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. It's rather soft and smooth, showcasing the estate-grown fruit bursting with flavors of raspberries and cherries. As with the winery's other reds from 2011, it is maturing quickly and drinking at or near its peak."
Northwest Collection,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,25.0,1,"Young and visibly spritzy, this appealing wine bursts forth with scents of lemon tea and orange blossoms, followed by flavors of orange soda, candied pineapple and stone fruits. It's round and fruity, definitely sweet, but kept lively with plenty of acid and that tongue-tickling spritz."
Northwest Collection,Merlot,89.0,25.0,1,"From a tremendous vineyard location known for its meticulous farming, this wine was made in small quantities. It exemplifies balance, pitting creamy, voluptuous texture against crisp apple and guava, the acidity never ceding entirely to the oak."
Northwest Totem Cellars,Red Blend,84.0,31.0,3,"Named for the proprietor's daughter, Taylor's is stainless-steel fermented and meant to exude juicy waves of pear, apple and lemon, a fully immersive expression of fruit and minerality. Well balanced, it shows a tease of peach fuzz and the crispness of never having met a swath of oak."
Northwest Totem Cellars,Syrah,84.0,30.0,2,"This vineyard-designate opens in bombastic amounts of Asian spice and wild strawberry, making for a whirlwind of flavor and acidity on the palate. Black tea and rose garden dance around highlights of orange and cranberry, the wine tart in mineralogy, as well as full of length and density."
Northwest Totem Cellars,White Blend,85.0,10.0,1,"This mix of 68% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 12% Petite Sirah offers blackberry jam, lavender and cracked pepper on the nose. Tart berries show on the sip, made more serious with a tarry structure and lifted by light purple flowers and an incense element that carries through the finish."
Nottingham Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,58.67,3,"Though lightly colored, this is a powerful Pinot Noir from the estate vineyard of Norman Beko. He cold-soaks the fruit and ferments with native yeasts to deliver aromas of raspberry, pine and wet slate. The flavors range from pomegranate to violet to red rose to a fruit punch that lingers a long time thanks to a nice acidic lift."
Nottingham Cellars,Cabernet Franc,91.0,50.0,1,"This Pinot Noir-Syrah blend opens up with aromas of cherry compote, red currant, pencil shavings and roasted beets. It's extremely silky on the palate, with purple fruit, even blueberries present. The alcohol is not out of balance, thanks to a touch of bitterness."
Nottingham Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,47.33,6,"The Hitching Post team of Frank Ostini and Gray Hartley hit a home run on this Highliner, with a nose that features fried shiitake mushrooms, violet and sizzling balsamic vinegar. It boasts an elegant mouthfeel, with very round and widely expressive fruit, characterized by orange peel, olallieberry and more violet."
Nottingham Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,89.0,34.0,1,"This is an extremely smooth Syrah, another reminder of how well the Rhône grape does when planted in California's cooler Pinot Noir climates. Licorice and boysenberry characterize the nose, with the combination of rich fruit and peppery spice framing the palate. The lingering vanilla finish kicks it up even one more notch."
Nottingham Cellars,Chardonnay,88.5,32.0,2,"Upfront aromas of buttered dinner rolls—which take on a caramel quality with long sniff—contrast nicely with lime edges. The wine is expansive on the palate, but subtle in flavorings, with toasted coconut, balanced acidity and, on the finish, toasted marcona almonds."
Nottingham Cellars,Malbec,91.0,50.0,1,"For some tasters, this will seem a bit earthy; for others there is a note of animal. The fruit is thin, the finish chalky and astringent."
Nottingham Cellars,Petite Sirah,88.0,36.0,2,"This is the most complex and detailed of the current single-vineyard Pinots from Rex Hill. English Breakfast tea, cherry liqueur, moist loam, dried leaf and highlights of cinnamon apple pie all contribute to a feminine, elegant, well-crafted wine."
Nottingham Cellars,Red Blend,88.67,32.67,3,"This is the winery's reserve-level Pinot Noir, and it's introduced with the loveliest aromas of fresh fruits and cut flowers. Elegant and seductive, the rich berry and cherry flavors come with a light dustiness, like a whiff of incense."
Nottingham Cellars,Syrah,87.0,40.0,1,"A pretty pale pink in color, this bottling is very yeasty, reminiscent of a sparkling wine, also showing sour strawberry, wet stone and orange peel on the nose. The yeast is prominent through the sip, dominating the sharp kumquat and pink-fruit flavors."
Novelty Hill,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.5,50.0,2,"This blend of 70% Syrah, 10% Merlot and 10% Sangiovese delivers vanilla, shaved coconut and dark fruit aromas. It's full bodied, with fruit and barrel-derived flavors that linger on the finish. The oak influence is cumbersome."
Novelty Hill,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.25,28.88,8,"Extremely light on the nose, there are faint whiffs of yellow pear and lemon on this bottling from the Los Angeles coast. Yellow-apple skins, dried apple flesh and lime peels show on the sip, which is cut by a decent acidity and proves a straightforward take on the grape."
Novelty Hill,Chardonnay,90.0,22.8,5,"Riesling and Gewürztraminer make up over half of this wine, giving it an aromatic punch. Vibrant ripe peach, flower and pear scents lead to an off-dry palate with fleshy fruit flavors. It provides easy-drinking appeal, though the concentration, especially through the midpalate, seems light."
Novelty Hill,Grenache,89.5,28.0,2,"Waffles and maple syrup in the aroma, and blackberries in the flavor seem to recommend this full-bodied wine for breakfast time. In fact it is a little sweet, and those maple-like notes continue in the flavors along with vanilla and cinnamon."
Novelty Hill,Malbec,88.67,28.0,6,"Electric pink in color, this brings wild strawberry, cherry, watermelon and spice aromas. The palate is broad and heavy, lacking lift."
Novelty Hill,Merlot,90.6,24.8,5,"This medium-bodied wine is like a liquid fruit bowl, pouring out apple, melon, peach and banana flavors that taste almost sweet. It has a broad mouthfilling texture, a rather soft balance and a lingering fruity finish."
Novelty Hill,Roussanne,88.33,22.67,6,"Incorporating 30% of the variety in Musqué clone, this wine offers fresh flavors of green apple, grass and pea shoots, as well as a distinct notion of oak. Aged in both new and neutral Acacia, as well as stainless, it has a spicy quality akin to lemongrass that lingers on the finish."
Novelty Hill,Sangiovese,88.17,27.0,6,"For such a deep-colored wine, it's the lighter red fruits and minerality that comprise the aromas in this GSM with Petite Sirah. Cranberry and crushed slate rise up most prominently, but the blackberry dominance on the palate better corresponds to the color, and the caramelized finish is a nice touch."
Novelty Hill,Sauvignon Blanc,90.7,19.0,10,"There are complicated aromas and flavors to this blend from Santa Barbara County pioneer Rick Longoria. It starts with scents of wet dog, pine, pipe tobacco and peppercorns. The flavors recall gamy meat, like roasted lamb, with hints of stewed plum as well. Those who don't like constantly analyzing each sip may find this wine challenging."
Novelty Hill,Syrah,89.7,28.0,10,"Possessing intensely floral aromatics, this distinctive wine also pulls in Asian spices, specifically curry. The fruit hangs on the light side of the red spectrum, with a dash of cherry candy."
Novelty Hill,Sémillon,92.0,16.0,1,"Soft, spicy and jammy, this is rich in clove and big-hearted blackberry fruit. Easy to like and pleasantly affordable, it'll pour well for parties and other occasions where a bold, crowd-pleasing red wine is in order."
Novelty Hill,Viognier,89.0,22.83,6,"The second release of Springhill's Mer Vin (sea wine) Pinot Noir is fruit-driven, and leaves an impression of sweetness along with the fruit flavors of strawberry jam. Powdered sugar and brown sugar and cream are evident, making for a pleasant, forward, easy-drinking wine for near-term enjoyment."
Noviello,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,48.0,1,"This is a changed wine from previous vintages, now emphasizing the berry flavors of the fruit and not shying away from some chewy tannins. It seems more honest and direct, without the wash of vanilla and jam, and more food-friendly as well, with the stuffing to take on a flank or hanger steak."
Noviello,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,18.0,1,"The blend includes 6% Syrah, and the wine has a pretty plum and blueberry color, that (perhaps by the power of suggestion) carries through into the aromas. It's tight, tart, and clean, offering a mix of berry fruits and a finish lined with vanilla and tobacco. Overall the balance is excellent, the wine juicy and fresh, and the blend just about perfect."
Noviello,Chardonnay,86.5,28.0,2,"Vivid and snappy, this was fermented in stainless steel, with a small percentage aged in neutral barrels to soften the mouthfeel. It's spicy and fresh, with a mix of fruit flavors including grapefruit and pineapple. A touch of vanilla enlivens the aromas."
Noviello,Sparkling Blend,88.0,45.0,1,"Spring Valley wines have never been shy and retiring, but here the alcohol – 15.2% – seems to quickly mute the textural subtleties. Though it suggests a panoply of red and black fruits in the nose, the palate is a wash of coffee, toast, tannin and alcohol. The flavors get muddy and the alcohol strips the wine of its terroir."
Novy,Red Blend,88.0,14.0,1,"Pie cherry and raspberry fruit flavors open, with gentle barrel notes of toast and caramel. Balanced and light, this has a pleasing elegance, though a quick finish suggests a lack of depth."
Novy,Syrah,92.2,36.0,5,"Meaning “from the vine,” this 100% whole-cluster bottling presents black cherry, tart pomegranate, graphite, baking spice and sage bark on the nose. There's lots of dark herbs and dark fruit on the palate as well as black-olive depth and black-slate minerality. With the density of herbs, it's a bit like chewing on sage and eucalyptus."
Novy,Viognier,88.0,30.0,2,"There's a lot to like in this dense and impactful wine, a mix of softly layered black plum and raspberry with a powerful bouquet of violet. Medium bodied, it finishes fresh and pillowy."
Novy,White Blend,85.0,14.0,1,"Concentrated lilac and violet flowers paint a pretty picture to the beef char and creosote darkness on the nose of this bottling from a Los Olives vineyard. The palate blends boysenberry, blackberry, coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate, loaded atop a very firm structure."
Novy,Zinfandel,90.4,34.0,5,"Pure purple fruit aromas arise on the nose of this bottling by pioneer Fred Brander, as do heady cocoa, leather and herb-crusted beef roast scents. Fresh black currant and espresso cream flavors show on the palate, with a chalky tannic structure that steadily reveals more layers of flavor, from blackberry to dried dill."
Nuggucciet,Pinot Noir,91.0,48.0,1,"Rustic cola, wood smoke, fresh-squeezed black cherry and slate emerge on the very compelling and complete nose of this bottling from the longtime winery's estate property. A load of baking spice powers the palate, enhancing the dark blackberry fruit. Its tannic structure is firm, allowing the layers of flavor to emerge with patience."
Nuthatch Cellars,Carmenère,88.0,28.0,1,"Black cherry, smoked beef jerky, burned caramel and a touch of maduro cigar show on the nose of this study of a popular Syrah clone. The palate is equally savory, with smoked meats, blackberry fruit, crushed black pepper, soy and a tarry edge, bolstered by sparkling acidity."
Nuthatch Cellars,Malbec,89.0,30.0,1,"This is a well-made wine, supple and soft with velvety, integrated tannins and a relatively light body and sense of power. Chocolate and brown sugar play off of black cherry and cassis for a richness that never becomes cloying."
ONX,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.5,65.0,2,"Though 2014 is a fine, accessible vintage for many Oregon Pinots, this one is rather stubbornly shut down. At first it shows stem and herb flavors, along with chewy tannins. With hours of breathing time, the fruit emerges, a mix of rhubarb, cherry and a dash of cola."
ONX,Petite Sirah,92.0,48.0,2,"From a single vineyard site in the appellation, this is a structured, even slightly austere wine, juicy yet enclosed in sturdy tannin. Clove, leather and tobacco drive the flavor, with a shot of black pepper on the finish."
ONX,Red Blend,91.91,48.55,11,"This is a tempting and sylish wine. A seductive aroma influenced by new oak resembles toasted baguette slices, cedar and cardamom, then generous flavors like ripe black cherry and blueberry come on. It's medium to full bodied, broad and smooth in texture with enough fine-grained tannin to give it some heft."
ONX,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.25,51.75,4,"This has a vivid, gold color with just a touch of pink, which makes sense considering Pinot Gris is not really a white wine grape, but a gris or gray shade in between blanc and noir. Aromas are like buttered popcorn, toasted almond and a touch of honey. It is undeniably flavorful, lush in texture and full bodied. The blend is 75% Pinot Gris and 25% Pinot Blanc."
ONX,Rosé,90.0,22.0,2,"This grabs attention quickly, with a dark color and potent jam and brown sugar aromas. Next come dazzling strawberry syrup flavors backed by thick tannins and good acidity. The texture is astringent and tight, but the flavors are so full that they meet the tannins half way. Best now through 2019."
ONX,Tempranillo,89.0,24.0,2,"A 100% varietal wine from a prime Beckstoffer vineyard in the heart of the appellation, this aged in 100% new French oak. A robust, full-throttled wine, it's smoky in tar and baked fruit that could use some time in cellar to further develop the layers of cedar and blackberry."
ONX,White Blend,87.5,35.0,2,"This extroverted wine brims with toasted oak, chocolate and smoke aromas, followed by ripe, jammy fruit flavors. With full body and a velvety texture of soft tannins, it's both smooth and tongue-gripping at the same time."
OS Winery,Cabernet Franc,91.0,27.5,2,"This esteemed winery's annual bubbly is crafted much like its still Chardonnays, showing focused aromas of chalk, lemon zest and a telltale brie cheese rind dairy element. It's very yeasty and slightly sour on the mouthwateringly sharp palate, with squeezed limes, lemon pith and underripe kumquat flavors."
OS Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,25.0,1,"Light and clear in color, this impish wine needs time to grow up in the bottle, its profile momentarily giving way almost entirely to savory Asian five-spice and a sharp acidity that should interweave together expertly over the years. Vibrant and complex, the fruit is sultry and dusted in earth. Set this one down through 2017."
OS Winery,Merlot,86.5,25.0,2,"The Lawrence Vineyard, on the Royal Slope, has proven itself as a source of fine Syrah. This wine does not reflect the quality that the vineyard can produce. It's a thin, tannic wine whose principal flavor seems to be vanilla."
OS Winery,Syrah,91.0,42.0,1,"A blend of fruit from the McGinley and Grassini vineyards, this wine is fermented in oak barrels, yielding a nose that's an approachable buffet of nectarine, wet cement, chopped lemongrass and wet hay. The oak also gives the palate more weight to deliver flavors of green-apple slices, kumquat, lime zest and cut lawn."
OZV,Zinfandel,86.0,15.0,1,"This 100% varietal wine offers plenty of crisp cranberry, currant and restrained red fruit on the palate, the texture soft and supple. A pleasing shock of dark chocolate appears on the finish."
Oak Farm,Red Blend,86.0,24.0,1,"Deep, dark blueberry fruit meets with beef char, fudge chocolate and espresso-bean notes on the nose of this blend of 59% Petite Sirah, 15% Syrah, 14% Tannat, 7% Petit Verdot, 4% Grenache and 1% Viognier. The rigid tannins need a little more time to open, but the zesty blueberry, blackberry and black-pepper flavors shine across the fresh, sizzling acidity."
Oak Farm,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,19.0,1,Aromas of fresh dill and other green herbs leap up from the glass. The plum flavors are pure and persistent. It's a unique expression of the variety.
Oak Farm,Verdelho,89.0,19.0,1,"Plummy chocolate stars in this densely textured yet nicely lean wine, which finds balance and power in the glass. Cherry, blueberry and cedar make appearances, before a finish kissed in tobacco."
Oak Farm,Zinfandel,88.0,30.0,3,"This wine has hints of cedar and coriander, a luxurious, velvety and appropriately tannic texture, and flavors that are ripe and delicious. Its personality seems confident, well balanced and well behaved, but strong and focused."
Oak Grove,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,8.0,2,"This vineyard-designated estate wine is restrained and elegant, allowing for a sparkle of raspberry and black cherry to speak. The oak is light and integrated, and the minerality well defined, with just the smallest traces of black licorice and pepper coming through on the finish."
Oak Grove,Chardonnay,86.67,8.67,3,"A blend of 60% Montepulciano and 40% Sangiovese, this is a grippy, leathery wine, the fruit sourced from two different sites in the appellation. Black leather, baked and dried plum, and cherry combine on the palate with breadth and length, finishing as if dusted in cocoa."
Oak Grove,Merlot,84.5,8.0,2,"Perfumed in rose and violet, with a sauvage scent of musk, this distinctive wine is soft and silky on the palate. It features a mix of red cherry and sage, with a full body and an expansive and lengthy finish."
Oak Grove,Petite Sirah,85.5,8.0,2,"Always an eye-opening bottling, this blends 50% Sangiovese with 50% Syrah. This vintage shows cooked blackberries, baked plums, balsamic vinaigrette and black rocks on the nose. The palate is juicy and energetic, blending dark fruit with bright acidity, coffee and caramel flavors, with strong tannins for structure."
Oak Grove,Pinot Grigio,84.0,8.5,2,"This is made from 92% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Pinot Noir, an interesting and fulfilling combination thats robust on the palate. Pinkish-orange in color, it's both tangy and weighty, finishing dry in orange zest."
Oak Grove,Sauvignon Blanc,85.5,8.5,2,"This is a spicy, earthy and medium-bodied selection, lengthy and concentrated in cardamom and forest pine. The fruit tends dark and brooding, with a brambly character balanced against the crispness of acidity. The spiciness persists through the finish."
Oak Grove,Viognier,87.0,8.67,3,"Copper-orange in color, this wine is made from 100% Syrah grapes, and tastes delightfully of raspberry and fresh plum. Juicy and refreshing, it has a leveled amount of acidity and yet a roundness to the palate that should work well with food, finishing crisp and clean."
Oak Grove,Zinfandel,86.67,8.0,3,"Juicy with blackberry and cola notes on the nose, but not overly dense thanks to a black-slate minerality, this wine offers somewhat simple grape-candy flavors on the palate along with lilacs and other purple flower elements. Those make for a fairly tasty and easy-to-quaff bottle."
Oak Knoll,Barbera,84.0,28.0,1,"Light, clear and crisp, this extremely light-bodied wine combines fruit from various vineyards and clones, and offers a suggestion of cranberry and pomegranate. Earthy, with an edge of forest and tea, it finishes plainly."
Oak Knoll,Chardonnay,85.5,13.25,4,"Tropical peach fuzz, grassiness and acidity give this wine a lively edge, supported by ample freshness on the palate, as well as length and body. A touch sour on the finish, it begs for just-caught seafood."
Oak Knoll,Pinot Gris,85.0,16.0,2,"Made by Nick Goldschmidt, this vineyard-designate is 100% varietal and made in relatively small amounts. Sanguine, it's gamy and brimming in black cherry, blueberry, nutmeg and black pepper. It's both robust and soft."
Oak Knoll,Pinot Noir,86.29,28.29,7,"Lemon custard, ripe Gala apples and a seemingly sweet candy element show on the nose of this wine from a family-owned producer. Bright energy and ripe apple characterize the palate, along with green pear skins and stonefruit."
Oak Knoll,Red Blend,82.0,20.0,1,"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mélange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating."
Oak Knoll,Riesling,87.0,10.0,2,"Palette is a sensational value from one of Walla Walla's still-unrecognized superstar vineyards, Spofford Station. This Cab/Merlot blend is saturated with fruit and beautifully crafted. In a difficult year (2004 froze out most Walla Walla vineyards) it is a rare jewel. Hints of compost, earth, mushroom and other herbal elements add interest, and the wine is buoyed with lively acid."
Oak Knoll,White Blend,88.0,10.0,2,"This outstanding Walla Walla boutique has established a track record for consistent improvement, and the white wines are best of show. Once again this 2006 blend is smooth, round and richly endowed with mixed stone fruits. Lovely aromas build a dense cloud of complex fruit, toast and caramel scents around the glass; once in the mouth the full-bodied fruit takes hold with lychee, peach and stone fruits. Immaculate and persistent, this stunning wine just keeps on coming."
Oak Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,100.0,2,"DeLille's D2 red (51% Merlot/38% Cabernet Sauvignon/8% Cab Franc/3% Petit Verdot) is a declassified wine in the best possible sense—the grapes come from all of the winery's premier vineyard sources. The result is a substantial, even meaty red wine, muscular rather than plump. The fruit is layered and tart, its flavors laced with smoke, tar and licorice. The wine gathers strength in the midpalate, then gradually unfolds through the finish with polished tannins that are just slightly herbal."
Oak Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,23.0,1,"Named after a property that Bill Foley's family owns in Texas, this kicks off with citrusy crème brûlée and tight honey elements on the nose. It opens softly with French toast on the palate, then tightens up with limestone minerality and lemon rind acidity. Just enough buttery vanilla lingers into the finish."
Oak Ridge,Chardonnay,86.0,14.0,1,"Aromas of baked sour cherry tart precede pleasing wafts of violet and lavender. From a vineyard planted largely to a field selection of the Swan clone, it offers an expected earthiness and spiciness that intrigues around a core of balanced tension between fruit, acid and oak."
Oak Ridge,Rosé,86.0,14.0,1,"Much is exciting about this boutique, Italian-varietal winery, including this lighter Nebbiolo, which offers juicy berry aromas along with incense and intense hibiscus. It's bright and lively on the palate, with pressed strawberry lifted by clove, nutmeg, orange peel and Christmas cookie spices, all set against leathery tannins."
Oak Ridge,Zinfandel,86.33,13.67,3,"Fermented 50% whole cluster and aged in neutral oak and concrete, this appealing wine offers notes of wild strawberries, brown stems and cigar box. It's fully flavored with a supple feel, with tannins that will benefit from some time in the cellar and a cinnamon-filled finish."
Oakville East,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,125.0,1,"Black as night in the glass and noticeably viscous, this shows brooding aromas of heavy char, black tobacco, cassis, bloody meat and balsamic vinegar. The palate isn't so heavy, though. Good acidity and tannins glide across the tongue while offering flavors of pencil lead, black cherry extract and black pepper."
Oakville East,Cabernet Franc,90.0,125.0,1,"From a historic vineyard in the heart of the Napa Valley, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon develops in the glass, evolving from muted aromas of earth and cinnamon spice to subtle cherry, cassis and oak. Balanced and lovely, the spice stays on the tongue throughout the long finish. It can easily be enjoyed now, but has the structure to age well through 2022."
Oakville East,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.67,93.33,3,"A bit lighter in color than other Rhône blends, certainly due to the 40% Counoise (and bolstered by 36% Mourvèdre and 24% Grenache), this offers a punchy red-currant, orange-rind and chaparral-scrub nose. Fresh cracked black pepper, cranberry-orange-plum juice and a rich earthy tone show on the palate."
Oakville Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,47.5,2,"Blistered red plum, savory herbs, black olive and a touch of green peppercorn show on the nose of this blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Petit Verdot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. Pencil lead and black peppercorns come through on the palate, spicing up the black-cherry, clay-earth and roasted-coffee flavors. It goes down easy."
Oakville Winery,Zinfandel,87.5,25.0,2,"Loads of clove, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg spice show up the strawberry, blueberry and red cherry aromas of this lavish bottling, which also offers scents of crushed rock and turned earth. Similar elements entertain the palate, culminating with a minty pine needle note, proving to be a very dynamic sip."
Oakwild Ranch,Pinot Noir,86.5,40.0,2,"This bright and fruity Beaujolais-style wine is as light and refreshing as a young wine can possibly be. It delivers a smile-inducing burst of strawberry and cherry fruit—round, ripe and juicy. You absolutely want to drink this sometime in 2016 while all that youthful energy remains."
Obelisco Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.89,76.67,9,"From 100% estate-grown grapes, and possessing 6.8 g/L of residual sugar, this wine is lovely in peach, pear and lemon, and quite voluptuous in texture, with a hint of spice. Pretty floral aromas of jasmine provide additional flourish and invitation, with the finish dry."
Obelisco Estate,Malbec,88.0,43.75,4,"Deep but not showy aromas of velvety lilacs, concentrated blackberry and river rocks pop on the nose of this blend of 42% Syrah, 37% Grenache, 14% Mourvèdre and 7% Counoise. Rounded purple-fruit flavors mesh with a silky, earthy texture on the palate, with olallieberry, caramel and a slow rising acidity."
Obelisco Estate,Merlot,88.75,47.5,4,"This is an exuberantly fruity, spicy and robust wine, speckled with 2% Petite Sirah. Dark and full of red berry flavor, the palate is dusted in brown sugar and black pepper. Ripe and concentrated, it drinks smooth and elegant despite its serious power."
Obelisco Estate,Rosé,86.0,35.0,1,"This blend of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Malbec and 22% Petit Verdot is rich and layered on the nose with black-cherry, blueberry, dark-chocolate and roasted-beef aromas. The palate kicks off with a touch of mint, then offers thick blueberry, coffee syrup and soy flavors. The structure is still quite sticky, and will open with time."
Obelisco Estate,Syrah,86.5,42.5,2,"Grippy leather and tobacco provide a gravelly texture and burly nature to this medium-bodied wine, which finds its groove in the glass. Concentrated and dense, it offers smoother elements of black currant, cassis and leather on the finish."
Obrien & Obrien,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,28.0,1,"The man who makes a million Syrahs dives into a blend of 60% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre and 15% Syrah on this bottling, which offers composting lilac, black pepper, fresh boysenberry, dried herb and a tarry quality on the nose. There's a strong blackberry-balsamic reduction flavor once sipped, as well as beef char, elderberry and more tar."
Obsidian,Red Blend,85.0,38.0,2,"From the vineyard once known as Alisos comes this wine, with aromas of soft clove, red cherry and a touch of sage. A strong ginger spice reigns over the palate, which is bitingly acidic, and shows dark strawberry fruit and dark thyme herbs. This wine is still quite wound up, but that acidity will prove mouthwatering for years to come."
Occasio,Cabernet Franc,90.0,50.0,2,"This is the companion wine to the equally-flirty Buxom Blonde White. Here the blend includes Cabernet, Merlot, Syrah and Sangiovese. It has substantial scents and flavors of fig and prune, earth and espresso. Done in a dark, soft, ready-to-drink style, it's fine for drinking with any barbequed meats."
Occasio,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,55.0,2,"This fruity wine is a sugary mix of bubble gum, mint and syrupy peaches. It consists of bold flavors, but lacks the delicacy that Riesling can show in many vintages."
Occasio,Chardonnay,89.0,26.5,2,"A mouthful of ripe, fruity jam and baking spice from a vineyard also sourced by the producer for Cabernet Sauvignon."
Occasio,Fumé Blanc,88.5,22.0,2,"Very deep purple for a rosé, although still transparent, this could be mistaken for a light red wine. That's also true for the aromas that include cherry pie, cola and a light dusting of clove. There is a tangy tension to the sip, then flavors of baked red cherry, pastry crust and more clove. It's rather delicious, but a tad heavy for a pink wine."
Occasio,Merlot,90.75,35.5,4,"This bright-colored, quite fruity wine has strong berry and cherry flavors, rich-feeling bubbles and a slightly sweet finish."
Occasio,Petit Verdot,92.0,34.0,1,"Maple-syrup aromas and a practically syrupy texture make this full-bodied wine taste sweet, while baking spices like cinnamon and vanilla accent the deep, ripe blackberry and black-cherry flavors. It's a very tasty wine for oak lovers."
Occasio,Petite Sirah,89.67,35.0,3,"A pale bronze color, this 100% Grenache rosé brings aromas of lime zest, strawberry and pear. Lightly spritzy, it drinks dry, with tart, elegantly styled fruit flavors. Orange-rind flavors persist on the finish."
Occasio,Pinot Gris,89.5,28.0,2,"This is a smooth, dry and well-integrated white, highlighted in apricot, peach and lemongrass, with an herbal undertone. It's ready for the table, with food-friendly acidity and medium body weight."
Occasio,Port,91.5,30.5,2,"This wine is 70% Grenache with the rest equal parts Mourvèdre and Syrah. Aromas of olive, earth, orange peel, black pepper and flower are followed by full-bodied red and black-fruit flavors. It shows intrigue but doesn't quite come together."
Occasio,Red Blend,88.0,30.0,1,"Full bodied and fleshy, this is an approachable wine, richly concentrated in candied-peach flavor that pleases and finds a balance between power and grace."
Occasio,Rosé,88.0,22.0,1,"Coming from the state's premier Riesling vineyard, this wine opens with lightly styled aromas of slate, apricot and peach. It drinks a hair off dry, with honeyed stone-fruit flavors."
Occasio,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,25.0,1,"Intriguing on the nose, this bottling shows raspberry, dried orange peel and dusty, crushed slate aromas. The palate is dominated by wet river stone and chalky minerality that frame the soft pink-fruit flavors."
Occasio,Syrah,90.33,37.67,3,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up three-quarters of this blend, with the rest Syrah (20%) and Grenache. Aromas of cedar, sawdust, vanilla, herb and medicine cabinet lead to creamy feeling fruit flavors. It brings appeal but the oak seems a bit too primary."
Occasio,Zinfandel,89.0,37.0,2,"This wine was aged for 34 months in a mixture of French (85%) and American oak. Light aromas of dark fruit, vanilla and barrel spice lead to full-bodied slightly sharp-seeming fruit and barrel flavors supported by firm tannins. It shows a lot of warmth on the finish."
Odette,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,98.0,1,"This wine is a bit reductive out of the gate, opening to reveal aromas of pear, peach, melon, lees and spice. The palate is creamy and textured in feel. If the aromas come together, it could move up a notch."
Oenophile Wines,Red Blend,82.0,27.0,1,"An inexpensive, large-production Pinot that's overly earthy and a little thin on the finish with a smidgen of residual sugar thrown in too, but reasonably priced and decently quaffable with food."
Ojai,Pinot Noir,95.0,45.0,1,"Time has not tamed this in-your-face, oaky, high-octane Syrah, which on the label says it's also known as “rasta red.” The wine is very tannic, smelling of earth and tar and sticky caramel and could use a touch more fruitiness to give it a lift. Do not attempt to drink without a sauce-slathered side of beef."
Ojai,Sangiovese,91.0,44.0,1,"Cut grass and cat pee aromas arise off of this appellation blend, with squeezed lime zest and dust also present on the nose. It's a textbook version of the grape, with more citrus peels and grassy elements on the palate, alit across a nicely weighted body."
Ojai,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,30.0,2,"Hazelnut, candle wax, dried apple and nectarine aromas show on the nose of this rich and nutty bottling. Similar flavors show on the palate, including dried apples, Meyer lemon, and a honeyed character that lasts into the finish."
Ojai,Syrah,94.0,49.0,1,"The aromas and flavors in this blend of 55% Syrah, 24% Grenache and 21% Mourvèdre perfectly match its Wild West-inspired label: they're unabashedly smoky and pair with anything off the grill. Smoky strawberry, red plum and tanned leather notes lead to an easygoing palate of red fruit that's spiced with white pepper, roasting herbs and barbecued meat."
Okapi,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,100.0,1,"Fashion designer/vintner Richard Hirsh is aiming for the mass market with this approachable if slightly sweet blend. Its wide appeal is the result of sun-filled fruit, showing honey, baked apple, orange blossom and tropical notes on the nose. It's soft on the palate, with candied apple, brown sugar and lemongrass flavors."
Olabisi,Petite Sirah,88.5,38.0,2,"This is a well-put-together, affordable wine that's moderate in ripeness and tannin and easygoing on the palate, offering a plethora of red and black cherry fruit."
Olabisi,Syrah,87.0,30.0,3,"Aromas of citrus peel, plum, herb, wood shavings and medicine cabinet are followed by plump cherry flavors. The tannins bring a slight sense of astringency."
Old Acre Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,120.0,1,"Different vintages favor different sites, and this Goosepen Block offering, though perfectly made, is not quite as dense the other vintage offerings from Sokol Blosser. A wash of milk chocolate surrounds raspberry and cherry fruit. Smooth and supple, with a streak of cola and red licorice, it fades gently into a finish tinged with flavors of clay."
Old Soul,Red Blend,86.0,16.0,2,"The addition of 5% Sémillon proves to be the right call in this white, a structured, spritzy glass of tree-ripened apricot and exotic lemongrass with a pleasant heft to the palate. A twist of ripeness gives a mouthwatering, juicy finish."
Olsen Estates,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.5,18.0,2,"As always, the historic winery produces a nuanced, restrained style, with a subdued nose of berries and balsamic reduction. It's light and bright on the palate, with chicory and woody tones and medium-ripe cherry fruit, a perfect partner to varied foods."
Olsen Estates,Rhône-style White Blend,91.0,21.0,1,"This wine is named for the mother of one of the owners, an artist and teacher who provided the inspired artwork found on the label. It blends mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Merlot and is soft in red currant with fully developed acidity."
Olsen Estates,Syrah,90.0,41.5,2,"This is a deep and concentrated white wine, ripely adorned in honey and apricot with a streak of honeysuckle dancing on the nose throughout. Creamy and round, it is buoyed by a fresh sprinkling of orange blossom and rind."
Olson Ogden,Marsanne,88.0,35.0,1,"Solely from Mount Veeder, this Cabernet Sauvignon has small percentages of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. The trio combine to offer currant and cranberry around a complex, woody core of oak, black tea and herbs."
Omero,Pinot Noir,89.75,41.5,4,"White pepper and matchstick come to the fore aromatically in this crisp white that's fuller bodied on the palate than one would expect given the aromatics. Apple and pear give a complex, autumnal fruit presence that leads up to a ripe, creamy finish."
On Point,Pinot Noir,90.0,38.0,1,"Ripe black raspberry and cherry mark this lovely Pinot that is rich and concentrated. The oak is prominent, with a touch of meaty gaminess on the full palate. Balanced, the wine's acidity remains remarkably bright."
On Q,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,125.0,1,"The winery excels at capturing the coolness and acidity of its vineyard site. Estate grown and bottled, this offers a creamy expression of bright, freshly cut kiwi, lychee and lime, surrounded by pretty floral aromas. Refreshing but with ample body, it calls out longingly for seafood."
Once and It's Gone,Chardonnay,90.0,18.0,1,Carbonic maceration is the fermentation technique employed in this wine. It brings out vibrant Bing-cherry flavors and with a hint of bread dough. There are interesting highlights of cured meats also. This is a good choice for drinking with roasted birds.
One,Red Blend,87.0,30.67,3,"Pinot Noir is not often blended (Champagne being the clear exception), but here it is partnered with 23% Syrah from Southern Oregon. The results are mixed, with neither grape showing much varietal character. A lightly fruity, cherry-flavored red, it finishes with some stiff tannins."
One Hope,Pinot Noir,85.0,19.0,1,"Slightly sour orange-cranberry aromas meet with a touch of sagebrush on this wine from an increasingly popular vineyard at the eastern edge of the Sta. Rita Hills. The even-keeled, very drinkable flavors surround tongue-tantalizing spice, light red fruit and a little caramel on the finish."
One Leaf,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,26.0,1,"This very elegant nose is like a love potion perfume of violet, sterling rose, myrrh and raspberry essence. The flavors veer toward tart raspberry and cranberry, with cola and purple flowers coming through before a brisk acidic finish."
Onesta,Cinsault,90.75,27.0,4,"Pretty in violet and rose petals this is a lower-octane Pinot Noir for the winery. Exquisitely rendered in spicy dark cherry and soft, supple tannins, it hails from a cool, coastal vineyard site 1,000 feet atop Occidental Ridge, the coolest source of grapes for Davis."
Onesta,Rosé,92.0,18.0,1,"Plum, cinnamon, Chinese five spice, egg nog, strawberry compote and sour cherry team up for a memorable nose. The palate proves more straight-ahead and savory, with sandalwood up front and fleshy plum, cooked rhubarb and some strawberry in the background."
Onesta,Viognier,88.0,22.0,1,"Gap's Crown remains a magical site for Pinot producers and Fulcrum does justice to it, providing a subtle entry of soft oak on the nose before letting it open further into dark, brambly berry and earth. The backbone is strong and structured, and the finish is long and soft, with an ideal seasoning of exotic Mediterranean spice and herb that linger fully and invite one in for more."
Onward,Malvasia Bianca,88.0,24.0,1,"There is distinct black pepper on the nose, as well as fresh raspberry and a minty strawberry sense. There is mild but noticeable tannic grip, tongue-dancing acidity and great flavors, ranging from plum pie to charred beets."
Opaque,Malbec,88.0,35.0,1,"Coming from four different Tempranillo clones planted at the winery's estate vineyard, it beguiles with notes of saddle leather, dried cherry, dusky spices and citrus spritz. The fruit flavors are polished and the tannins structured—a thoroughly delightful bottle."
Opaque,Red Blend,90.0,30.0,1,"Solid and substantial, this single-vineyard wine has real meat on its bones, both figuratively and literally, as it carries some savory notes along with ripe blackberry fruit. The acid-tannin balance is picture-perfect, and though sturdy and ripe, it conveys an impression of grace and elegance."
Opaque,Zinfandel,90.0,30.0,1,"Golden yellow in color, this 16-year-old sparkler presents uniquely pleasant aromas of corn bread, chamomile and yellow flowers. It's not powerfully effervescent, but manages to strike up a rich bubbly cream on the palate, with flavors of corn tortilla and Meyer lemon making for memorable sipping."
Opolo,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,32.0,1,"This age-worthy wine smells like the shady side of a mountain, with black olive notes and roasted fennel alongside cedar-spiced strawberries and brambly berries. Both firm tannins and pungent acidity fuel the palate, with cherry, raspberry and slightly bitter espresso. Drink 2020–2025."
Opolo,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,55.0,1,"This is the first reserve Malbec from Seven Hills, the winery that first introduced this as a varietal wine in the Walla Walla Valley. Inviting aromas of pepper, coffee, vanilla and cream introduce a dark and sappy wine, with concentrated raspberry and blackberry fruit at its core. Superb ripeness and lift from the juicy acidity mark this as indeed reserve-level in quality."
Opolo,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,92.0,32.0,1,"This tasty and full-bodied blend of Rhône varieties has an attractive, spicy, oak aroma that continues through the flavors. It finds ripe black-cherry notes in the core and enough concentration to form a lingering finish."
Opolo,Meritage,89.0,47.0,1,"Rich cherry blossoms and dried strawberry-cherry paste aromas make for a very fruit-forward bottling. The palate is grippy with tannins that long hold attention, with dark red fruit and cinnamon flavors."
Opolo,Red Blend,90.0,28.0,1,"This clonal study blends rich black cherry and sassafras notes with cola, savory herbs, strong iron and slight scorched rubber aromas. The palate jumps from a red cherry and cranberry tartness right into a toasted sage and pencil-lead character."
Opolo,Zinfandel,90.0,24.0,4,"Reaching back into the 19th century, this wine revives an old-style label design, while putting a very modern spin on the blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Light cherry fruit mixes with both herbal and slightly vegetal streaks."
Ordaz Family Wines,Pinot Noir,89.0,38.0,1,"Soft and juicy in black cherry and plum, this wine offers good value in its blend of girth and acidity. It piques interest on the palate with its toned black licorice and velvety structure."
Ordaz Family Wines,Zinfandel,91.0,42.0,1,"Aromas like black olive, clove and dark cherry continue in the flavors of this full-flavored and full-bodied wine. Mellow oak notes like cedar and tobacco add complexity."
Oregon Trails,Pinot Noir,87.0,19.5,2,"Aromas of Key lime skins and lemon bar cookies hide a slight but typical petrol note on this wine from the San Diego County-based producer. It's slightly sour on the citrusy palate, with balanced acidity and a chalky grip."
Orfila,Pinot Noir,92.8,40.0,5,"Petal pink in the glass, this wine was specifically grown to be a rosé by winemaker David Galzignato. The nose is pretty with bubble gum, strawberry, raspberry and a bit of lime peel, and the palate offers flavors of ruby-red grapefruit and lemon juice, with bright acidity throughout."
Origin,Pinot Noir,90.0,60.0,1,"Made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, complemented with a small handful of Merlot, the wine is aged in new French oak half barrels. Tannic and savory in cassis and cranberry, the wine also shows a trace of black tea and tomato leaf. The wine's oak remains extremely pronounced, which suggests some time in cellar, through 2020."
Original House Wine,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,11.0,1,"From a hilltop location near the ocean-influenced town of Freestone, this wine is silky in plum and dark cherry, a hint of mushroomed earth doing its best to come out. Robust on the palate, juicy berry fruit satisfies, finishing thick and rich."
Original House Wine,Chardonnay,85.0,10.0,1,"Ripe and forward, this brings brambly berry fruit and plenty of Dr Pepper soda flavors front and center. It's a smooth ride to a quick finish. Both scents and flavors show a hint of pine needle."
Original House Wine,Sauvignon Blanc,84.67,10.67,3,"This is lushly fruity, a big bowl full of strawberries, with a milk chocolate coating. There's nothing wimpy here, but the low alcohol keeps it zippy and perfect for warm-weather quaffing."
Orpheus,Red Blend,82.0,25.0,1,"This wine opens with a curious waft of pastry-like vanilla cream underneath cherry tart and a squeeze of citrus. Oaky on the back palate it struggles to find itself in the glass, the fruit trying to make its way through the thickness of tannin. Letting the wine air a bit should help."
Oso Libre,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.5,34.5,2,"Baked strawberry and a bittersweet note of cherry play off the palate around a medium-bodied frame of subtle tannin and oak. Dried cranberry comes in as a secondary detail, before the wine finishes in a blaze of leather and black tea."
Oso Libre,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,39.5,2,"This ripe and rich wine has firm tannins and a smooth texture, making it a tasty match for rich protein dishes. It packs plump blackberry and juicy boysenberry flavors in a blend that tastes just slightly sweet, coating the palate and lingering on the finish."
Oso Libre,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,89.0,46.0,2,"Musky in leather, tobacco and black tea, this wine is juicy in currant and cranberry before finishing a tad flat. From a robust mountain appellation, it's surprisingly resolved in terms of tannin and the oak is relatively restrained."
Oso Libre,Chardonnay,90.0,26.0,1,"This is beautifully lilting in preciously defined aromas of rose petal and wild strawberry. From there, it's all subtlety and ethereal elegance. The wine is restrained, nurtured in a basket of nutmeg and graham cracker, as well as freshly packed mushroomy earth. This wine is a stunner right out of the glass, but is sure to continue its fine course through 2022–2025."
Oso Libre,G-S-M,92.0,40.0,1,"Sanguine and brooding in dense layers of juicy black fruit, leather and tobacco, this is classic Napa Valley Cabernet with an elegance at its core, that's also seamless, complex and age-worthy. From relatively cooler sites in Oak Knoll and Mount Veeder, and a cooler year too, this vintage sings for this producer, showing balance and power in equal measure."
Oso Libre,Mourvèdre,91.0,36.0,1,"Separate from the other Original Vines bottling, this is part of the new single-vineyard series, and includes the famed South Block grapes. Lush and fragrant, full-bodied yet in the classic, elegant Eyrie tradition, this bursts with complexity. Bramble, cherries, strawberry preserves, coffee grounds and a hint of root beer come together in a deep, dense and thoroughly delicious wine."
Oso Libre,Primitivo,89.0,38.5,2,"A block selection, this most rare offering from DDO has rippingly good aromatics, intense and complex, with dusty, dreamy spices wrapped around a seamless mix of berry, earth and herbal components. The somewhat gritty texture gives it muscle and length, and the overall complexity suggests it can age for up to a quarter century. Drink now through 2035."
Oso Libre,Red Blend,91.2,35.8,5,"Those who think they prefer anything but Chardonnay may be convinced otherwise with this wine. It is so powerfully evocative in crisply rendered Meyer lemon and tangerine notes, with aromas of fresh white flowers teasing provocatively on the nose. Seamless and seductively bright in acidity, it glides down the palate, hinting at a richness that never becomes overdone."
Oso Libre,Zinfandel,85.0,38.0,1,"Full-bodied and exuberant in lush tannins, this black Shiraz is concentrated and rich in hearty leather, espresso and black tea yet buoyed by lively acidity and beautiful streaks of black and white pepper. Enjoy now or through 2021."
Osprey's Dominion,Chardonnay,86.0,16.0,1,"This reserve-level cuvée has been made since 2004, but in severely limited amounts. A mix of one-third new, one-third once-used and one-third neutral oak barrels aged the blend. Rich, tight and sappy, it shows generous ripe stone and tropical fruits, along with rich layers of butterscotch and toast. Drink now through 2025."
Osprey's Dominion,Meritage,87.0,35.0,1,"Homer is the estate reserve, wood-tank fermented and blended from the winemaker's best barrels. Aromatic and toasty, it takes many hours to open fully, revealing a dense core of ripe cherry fruit wrapped in a mélange of tasty, toasty barrel flavors. Along with the gorgeous fruit comes a cavalcade of chocolate, caramel and buttered nuts. Drink now through 2020."
Otis Kenyon,Red Blend,87.0,24.5,2,"Silky on the palate, this offers exotic aromas of orange blossom and spicy cardamom. Juicy in fresh cherry, it combines structured elegance and plenty of power, amid a mouthwatering quality that's seductively delicious and yet just begs the question of how much more nuanced the flavors will be in time. Drink through 2022."
Otis Kenyon,Syrah,91.5,38.0,2,"Fresh-picked Bing cherry delights on the initial entry into this silky Pinot, sourced from a long-famous site in the heart of the Russian River. Medium-bodied and nicely structured, it offers ample concentration around a core of elegance, with a lingering finish of vibrant cherry. Enjoy through 2022."
Ott & Murphy,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.33,34.33,3,"Even by past standards, this new vintage of Sineann's Old Vine Zin is spectacular, with ripe, jammy, concentrated fruit flavors of fig, black cherry and purple plum. The balance among the fruit, acidity, tannin and alcohol is spot-on, without blowing away the more subtle compexity of the old vine fruit."
Ott & Murphy,Counoise,88.0,29.0,1,"This marks the debut of the Ramos Vineyard Chardonnay, inspired by a high-elevation site planted in 2001 by the late Bob Sessions and Jose Ramos, now director of vineyard operations. The wine paints a portrait of high-toned, elegant minerality accented by peach and lithe lemon. Capable of aging, it dances in acidity, with just a hint of caramel-vanilla on the finish. Made in tiny quantities, it's worth desperately seeking out."
Ott & Murphy,Marsanne,90.0,27.0,1,"This vineyard-designated wine reflects its sense of place remarkably well, offering tight dark cherry and blueberry around a strong character of wild earth, tea and herb. High in acidity and minerality, and yet powerfully understated, it's gorgeously drinkable now but will gain further complexity through 2022."
Ott & Murphy,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.83,25.0,6,"This classic Chardonnay brims in lemon chiffon, stony minerality and luscious pear. The complex, soft, supple layers continue to surprise in the glass, teasing the palate with unexpected notes of nutmeg and Tahitian vanilla."
Ott & Murphy,Rhône-style White Blend,86.5,23.0,2,"This hillside-grown wine is only vineyard-designated in special vintages. The nose is like a delicate pine sap, with elements of spearmint, sweet camphor and anise set against light raspberry juice. It's elegant but energetic, with soy sauce, clove and menthol highlighting the hibiscus and red and purple fruits."
Ott & Murphy,Rosé,83.0,16.0,1,"A 100% varietal wine from grapes sourced in Coombsville, this offers cranberry, currant and clove in equal measure. This tiny-production project features tight-grained tannin and a dusty texture built around moderate acidity and body."
Ott & Murphy,Syrah,89.5,31.5,2,"This soft, round and juicy wine is ripe and full bodied, a good representative of the vintage. It shows brambly black fruit, mocha and hints of coconut flakes that endure through the finish."
Ott & Murphy,Viognier,88.0,29.0,2,"A full-bodied expression of the variety, blended with 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, this soft, rounded wine is dense in blueberry and currant, with a complexity of leather, pencil and soy. A pinpoint of reduction on the finish gives it a tinge of bitterness."
Ottimino Vineyards,Zinfandel,91.5,28.5,2,"This gets special attention because winemaker Kevin Riley is one of the few to engage with old vines of the historic Mission grape variety. Light watermelon, orange spritz and wet cement show on the nose, while the slightly watery palate offers red fruit, crushed rock and citrus rinds on the finish."
Ousterhout,Pinot Noir,89.55,30.09,11,"This blends 51% Merlot with 29% Zinfandel, 15% Petit Verdot and 5% Petite Sirah, combining nicely for a full-bodied expression of chocolate and dried dark cherry. On the palate, it becomes dusty and somewhat rustic, with an intensely juicy finish."
Ousterhout,Sauvignon Blanc,89.33,24.0,6,"Mineral, dried peach, lees and honeysuckle aromas lead to just off-dry flavors. Racy acidity frames it nicely."
Ousterhout,Zinfandel,90.5,34.0,2,"Aromas of toast, coffee, herb and red fruit are followed by generous coffee and cherry flavors. The tannins bring a touch of grit but it retains an overall pretty appeal."
Overland,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,25.0,1,"This is a stainless-steel fermented combo of 90% Syrah with 10% Zinfandel. It's light and easy on the nose but dark in color and brooding in weight, made in a full-bodied style."
Ovum,Gewürztraminer,92.0,25.0,1,"Pleasing aromas of cocoa, dried herb and red fruit lead to a full-bodied palate with a tight core of grippy tannins. Vanilla and spice notes run throughout."
Ovum,Riesling,92.0,25.0,5,"A strong element of minty eucalyptus shows in this wine that is full bodied on the palate and integrated in oak, with an accent of clove. Fruity berry pie and mocha round out a softened, approachable texture that'll pair well at the table."
Owen Roe,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,74.25,4,"This rare bottling of this variety displays aromas of pear and spice along with whiffs of tropical fruit. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied with a creamy, slightly unctuous feel."
Owen Roe,Cabernet Franc,91.0,64.5,4,"Largely Chardonnay and Riesling, this wine offers aromas that include peach, pear, melon and almond. It's full in feel, lightly sweet with citrus and stone-fruit flavors that linger."
Owen Roe,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.43,56.14,7,"Herb and citrus aromas lead to lightly spritzy, just off-dry tropical fruit flavors that linger."
Owen Roe,Chardonnay,90.67,41.33,3,"The pear, apple, toast and cinnamon aromas are light and elusive. The flavors are elegant, with the concentration trailing toward the finish."
Owen Roe,Pinot Gris,91.0,21.0,2,"The first release on the winery's new label program, which shines a bright light on the soils of their sprawling vineyard atop the Cuesta Grade, this offers clean aromas of lemon peel. The palate is almost spritzy with energy, showing lime juice, green pear and dried-apple flavors all bound together by a searing acidity."
Owen Roe,Pinot Noir,91.43,44.43,7,"Pink-orange in color, this straightforward, even-keeled wine offers a bouquet and taste of fresh strawberries and pink grapefruit, with mellowed structure behind it. It has enough weight to pair well with antipasto and the like."
Owen Roe,Red Blend,90.0,24.0,3,"Brawny in blackberry, blueberry and black pepper, with a shake of cinnamon, this is a soft, complex wine with leathery undertones. From steep, volcanic-soiled vines, it's appropriately tannic without being overbearing."
Owen Roe,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,24.0,2,"The nose on this wine from a very promising appellation for value is very root-vegetable-driven, with aromas of just-cut beets, boiled rhubarb, green and black olives and a hint of strawberry. The palate is earthy and interesting, showing lots of chopped black olive, which may be a turn-off for some expecting a more fruit-driven experience."
Owen Roe,Syrah,90.12,39.25,8,"Copper peach and orange in color, this light, dry wine is soft and refreshing. Flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and cherry don't overwhelm on the palate. It finishes crisp and ready for another sip."
Owl Ridge,Red Blend,88.0,18.0,2,"Ripe fruit flavors advance from apple to pear to honey as you sniff and sip this wine. It tastes clean and fruity, with a medium body and a smooth texture that allows the fruitiness to linger on the finish."
O•S Winery,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,45.0,1,"Black and green olive tapenade and ripe plum come together around a soft, juicy yet ultimately tannic expression of the variety, given 14% Malbec and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon as worthy complements."
O•S Winery,Cabernet Franc,88.0,28.5,4,"Aromatic and forward, this is scented and flavored with macerated red plums and cherries. It remains tough and chewy, showing buttery lactic flavors that have not entirely integrated, with a bitter edge to the finish. More bottle age may help smooth it out."
O•S Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.2,36.0,5,"Wild strawberry and a soft layering of fresh earth form the core of this blend, based mostly on Cabernet Sauvignon, with a healthy dose of Merlot and then smaller supporting handfuls of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Blackberries come to fore as the wine develops, along with a swathe of bittersweet chocolate."
O•S Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,90.0,30.0,1,"A tremendous Grenache from the Foothills, estate grown from Beaucastel budwood and let to develop slowly, this wine has acres to go before it sleeps. Still superdense and dark with fruity plum and anise predominating, it'll grow old with tenderness and grace."
O•S Winery,Merlot,89.0,50.0,1,"The Boushey character shines through in this elegant, complex wine. A lovely, sensual mix of loam, mushroom, tobacco and black cherry blends into a stylish wine with exceptional detail all the way through its lengthy finish."
O•S Winery,Red Blend,88.75,23.75,4,"This very limited reserve mixes old-vine fruit from the Bacchus and Weinbau vineyards (all under the Sagemoor umbrella). Berries, cherries and cassis draw you into a dusty, detailed wine with nuances of herb and earth. A lick of rich dark chocolate ends it with a flourish."
O•S Winery,Riesling,91.0,22.0,1,"The first release for Tranche from Blue Mountain (estate) fruit, this classic Cabernet benefits from the same extended aging in barrel and bottle that sister winery Corliss gives its wines. Toasty, smoky and precisely defined dark fruit hold down the core, a muscular mix of black cherry, cassis, dried herb and leaf. Firm and compact, with well-integrated barrel flavors (two thirds were new), this balances Euro elegance with New World vitality."
O•S Winery,Syrah,92.0,35.0,1,"This dry estate wine is voluptuous and richly floral, with well-developed stone fruit and melon flavors. Medium-bodied, it's weighty enough to be enjoyed on its own or at the table with a wide array of foods."
O•S Winery,White Blend,92.0,20.0,1,"Though not a blush wine, this has a hint of a tawny color, and a whiff of alcohol reflecting the riper, warmer vintage. The fruit flavors range from Key lime to orangeade."
PRIE Vineyards and Winery,Gewürztraminer,88.0,25.0,1,"This is an herbal, earthy, delicately layered and silky wine with red cherry and pomegranate characteristics. Medium-bodied, it stays true to its varietal nature by being light on its feet."
Pace,Chardonnay,86.0,45.0,1,"Woody tannins support this full-bodied reserve wine's dark, brooding black fruit. Grippy on the palate, it combines forceful mocha, leather and cedar flavors with touches of sage and graphite."
Pace,Pinot Noir,89.0,45.0,1,"Very flavorful and generous, this wine has bright berry aromas, a mouth-filling, smooth mousse and vibrant, ripe raspberry and cherry flavors."
Pacific Crest,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,19.0,1,"Pretty to look at and lovely in the mouth, this all-Pinot rosé offers gentle hints of plum, sour cherry and orangeade. Bracing acidity puts a tight, tangy twist to the finish."
Pacific Crest,Chardonnay,88.0,17.0,1,"Aromas of garden herbs, cherry and bittersweet chocolate lead to medium-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins are quite firm and need some time (hopefully) to soften. The oak seems to get out front."
Pacific Rim,Chenin Blanc,89.5,14.5,2,"Stainless steel fermented and aged Chardonnay (eg ‘naked') is becoming commonplace, but few offer as much snap and juicy fruitiness as this one. It's a great, round mouthful of grape juice, crisp green apple and suggestions of pineapple and citrus. A little fresh herb rounds out the finish."
Pacific Rim,Gewürztraminer,88.0,16.0,3,"A succulent, almost thick mouthfeel and subtle doughy, nutty flavors give this full-bodied wine a lot of impact on the palate. The good viscosity seems to coat the sides of the mouth and help extend the finish."
Pacific Rim,Grüner Veltliner,87.67,16.0,3,"The aromas are quite light and brooding, with notes of dark fruit, vanilla, herb, coconut, wood and baking spice. The cranberry and cherry flavors bring a seamless feel. The oak influence seems a bit intense but it still brings plenty of appeal."
Pacific Rim,Riesling,89.27,23.81,26,"The aromas are generous, with notes of cigar box, dried herb, brambly berry and dried hay. The meaty flavors are round and full, providing appeal, finishing a bit warm."
Pacifica,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,85.0,26.0,1,"Slightly sour Meyer-lemon-pith aromas meet with honeysuckle and yellow pear on the nose of this bottling by veteran Bob Lindquist. There is a strong sizzle of acidity on the sip, where green-apple flavors meet with tart nectarine and lime-peel zip. It's very fresh and food-friendly."
Pacifica,Meritage,85.0,36.0,1,"Black-cherry-cola aromas along with lots of licorice and Dr Pepper spice show on the nose of this bottling from a relatively new winery in northeast Paso Robles. There is slight sweetness to the palate, with baked cherry and baking-spice flavors. Accents of dried blackberry, leather, dried meat and purple flower add complexity."
Padis,Red Blend,90.5,85.0,2,"Boisterous blueberry, black cherry and black-currant aromas make for a hedonistic nose on this bottling that also offers a sultry line of cocoa, espresso and clove spice. The palate shows similar layering, from black-cherry compote to herbs to black olives, proving unique overall."
Paetra,Pinot Blanc,89.0,20.0,1,"This wine is a unique in the state blend and features Cinsault (35%), Grenache (35%) and Mourvèdre. Pale peach in color with a slight bronze tinge, the aromas are light, with notes of strawberry, citrus zest and mineral. The flavors are dry, sleek and high acid. It's a perfect summer wine."
Paetra,Riesling,90.33,26.67,3,"The aromas are light, with notes of candle wax, herb and spice. The palate brings a light but still rounded, creamy feel that carries through the lingering finish."
Paetra,Rosé,91.0,20.0,1,"Pale salmon in color, this wine is 63% Mourvèdre and 37% Grenache. Aromas of fresh strawberry, watermelon, spice and cherry lead to bone-dry mouthwatering fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal."
Page Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,37.0,1,"Spicy earth meets baked plum and cherry in this medium-bodied wine sourced from multiple sites, including Sangiacomo Vineyards. Mint and lavender scents emerge on the nose before stronger elements of tobacco take over on the finish."
Page Cellars,Chardonnay,85.0,19.0,1,"Baked cherry and cranberry fruit kick off the nose of this bottling, followed by then wild thyme and touches of dust and smoke. The palate is light and zesty, with hibiscus and tea flavors along with cranberry fruit and more fresh herbs on the finish."
Page Cellars,Red Blend,85.5,32.5,4,"From the famous Westside Road-adjacent vineyard, this Chardonnay shows a proclivity toward lush roundness of texture and tropical flourish in flavor. Vanilla nuttiness is complemented by pineapple, green apple and caramel, lasting long into the finish."
Page Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,19.0,1,"Blackberry, anise and spice aromas are followed by rich full-fruit flavors. It's made in a hedonistic style that doesn't hold back."
Page Mill Winery,Chardonnay,86.0,28.0,1,"This cuvée gets some extra time in 40% new wood, and is bottled unfiltered. Plush blackberry and black cherry fruit flavors, accented with streaks of cola and chocolate, capture your attention. It's a rich tasty forward immediately enjoyable bottle, so go for it now through 2020."
Page Mill Winery,Merlot,88.0,28.0,1,"Golden Delicious apple meets tart Meyer lemon in this medium-bodied, expressive vineyard designate bolstered by 25% new French oak. A velvety texture enwraps its savory fruitiness and stony acidity."
Page Mill Winery,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,32.0,1,"Harvested on the night of the new moon (hence the name); this was aged in one-year-old French oak. The fruit stands out, striking for its dense purple shade, its meaty undertones and its pretty purity. It's overlaid with big barrel flavors of caramel and toast—delicious, but dominant. Let it breathe!"
Page Mill Winery,Rosé,88.0,18.0,1,"The extra time has helped to unwrap what must have been an exceedingly compact wine, but it still needs to be decanted and/or cellared further. The black fruits are subservient to the dense, tarry tannins. Everything is ripe, but ripe as fine Bordeaux is ripe, with earth and bark and herb still prominent."
Page Mill Winery,Syrah,88.5,30.0,2,"Compact and chewy, with clearly delineated Bordeaux style and character. Cassis and black cherry fruit; stiff, earthy tannins, good length and fine aging potential. The acids and tannins are in good proportion, and the fruit is not overtaken with new oak, but there is enough (40%) to frame it with some sweet spices."
Pagter Brothers,Syrah,89.0,45.0,2,"This is a linebacker wine, at 15.7% abv, bursting with roasted coffee, licorice and dry tannins all around. Soft, supple and round, and fully concentrated, the finish could use a bit more harrumph. The back label's suggestion to pair this wine with short ribs is a good call."
Pahlmeyer,Pinot Noir,93.0,56.67,3,"Like its stablemates, the Elton bottling has dropped more than a point of alcohol in 2010, and the winery's lineup overall tilts toward the thin and herbal. Here the cranberry fruit shows little charm. There's a spine of iron and a finish amply loaded with flavors of herb and earth."
Paix Sur Terre,Grenache Blanc,91.0,27.0,1,"This has a hard shell keeping it closed down, despite hours of airing. Cranberry fruit with a hint of mineral seems to quickly hit a wall and stop short. More bottle age may help to open it up a bit."
Paix Sur Terre,Mourvèdre,92.12,51.0,8,"From one of the state's most highly regarded vineyards, this boasts beguiling aromas of milk chocolate, plum, barrel spice, vanilla, herb and coffee. Lightly smoky, sensuous fruit and barrel flavors follow, showing more elegance than this often brawny appellation is known for."
Paix Sur Terre,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,48.0,4,"This wine leads with light mineral, pear and white grapefruit aromas. It's medium-bodied on the palate, with bright acidity and citrus rind flavors that persist into the finish and keep you coming back for more."
Paix Sur Terre,Ugni Blanc,90.67,27.0,3,"From the producer's estate site, in homage to her Spanish heritage, this white sizzles in varietal typicity, showing bright, forward notions of green apple, peach and a compelling wet-stone minerality that provides a gravelly edge to the texture. It lingers in honeysuckle."
Palencia,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,50.0,1,"This once common and now hard-to-find grape makes for a hearty wine, with earthy aromas of baked soil, composting rose petals, dried but not raisiny black fruit and rustic leather. Dried red cherry starts the sip, with more earthiness on the midpalate, including gravel and asphalt—a very interesting wine."
Palencia,G-S-M,91.0,36.0,1,"Brooding smoke, purple fruit and violet aromas are followed by sumptuous fruit and barrel flavors in this Syrah. Barrel notes linger on the finish, feeling a bit raw but not detracting from the overall enjoyment."
Palencia,Petit Verdot,91.0,50.0,1,"This leads with vibrant and fresh aromas, recalling cut grass, herbs, lime zest and citrus, with whiffs of tropical fruit. The palate brings tart, zingy, mouthwatering citrus flavors, with a lightly creamy feel on the finish."
Pali,Chardonnay,90.0,37.0,3,"Light and delicate on the nose, this single-vineyard Chardonnay shows white peach, honeysuckle and browned butter on the nose. There is good tension to the sip, but also riper flavors of apple cider, pan-seared pear and lemon preserves."
Pali,Pinot Noir,90.68,45.28,25,"This lovely, layered wine from the Santa Ynez Valley-based producer shows iron, cranberry, shiitake, cola and cherry on the nose. Those same elements are delicately woven into the palate, enhanced by a Sichuan peppercorn kick and vibrant acidity that will ensure a long life ahead. Its flavors continue to unwind as it opens in the glass."
Pali,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,21.0,1,"This tremendous red wine is robustly aromatic, layering its black currant, dark cherry and chocolate scents with dusty sage and cedar. Luxuriously textured and smooth, it finishes focused and direct, with a lift of welcome acidity and complexity."
Palmer,Chardonnay,84.0,12.0,1,"Focused and dense, this intense wine captures the essence of ripe raspberries. Aged in 50% new French oak, it's got a strong vein of coffee and mocha. The flavors broaden out and penetrate, finishing with highlights of cedar, cinnamon and dark chocolate. Drink now through the 2020s, but decant if you want the full expression."
Palmer,Pinot Blanc,83.0,13.0,1,"Domaine is the winery's top Pinot Noir: all-estate grown, from grapes now certified biodynamic. It's an accessible, pretty wine, with rich flavors of pastry fillings—think raspberry scones. It's got a tart, tangy grip and the length and structure to age at least a decade."
Palmina,Arneis,90.0,20.0,1,"Fruit from the oldest blocks in this pioneering vineyard is sourced here. It's bright, spicy and focused, with forward citrus-scented Bing cherry flavors. The concentration and length are outstanding, with just the lightest suggestion of green herbs rounding out the finish."
Palmina,Barbera,88.33,40.0,3,"Light gold in color, this wine is focused and bright. A jasmine aroma and succulent green-apple flavor pairs with steely minerality, offering power and grace in one satisfying package."
Palmina,Malvasia Bianca,92.0,26.0,1,"This is one of the most beloved Chardonnays from Santa Barbara County, and for good reason: Bryan Babcock manages to imbue his wine with buttery richness yet also balance it with acidity and smoke. Honeysuckle, almond and Gravenstein apple aromas lead into energetic yet creamy marshmallow and poached pear flavors, all cut with citrusy acidity."
Palmina,Merlot,92.0,53.0,1,"This bottling reveals that this historic vineyard can produce incredibly rich wine as well as the zestier styles it is known for. It shows black cherry, candied strawberry and bourbon-like spice on the nose. The mouthfeel is lavish, full of purple fruit and floral flavors, as well as peppery spice and vanilla warmth. The acidity and structure are solid, and there's a touch of tar on the finish."
Palmina,Nebbiolo,93.5,75.0,4,"This stellar reserve remains one of the finest Chardonnays from Oregon. Meyer lemon, peanut oil, salted nuts, citrus and tangerine combine in a deep and intense palate. Whole-cluster pressed and barrel fermented (but in just 10% new French oak), this delicious, dense and penetrating wine should be consumed now through the early 2020s."
Palmina,Red Blend,89.67,43.0,3,"This hearty and heavily spiced take on the grape offers fascinating black cherry, cardamom, chai spice and sanguine, meaty scents on the nose. The flavors may strike some palates as too intense, brimming with dried red cherry, Indian spice and kalamata olive, bound by energetic acidity and tactile grip."
Palmina,Tocai Friulano,93.0,22.0,1,"Cloudy, pungent and supremely earthy, this wine reveals its delicate acidity over time, bringing balance to its flamboyant fruit. With intense strawberry, orange peel and black tea flavors, it's savory and richly built, finishing on a touch of smoky vanilla."
Palouse,Cabernet Franc,89.0,29.0,1,"Multiple vineyards contribute to this standout blend. It feels open and accessible, yet carries the structure to age gracefully. You'll find interesting threads of freshly picked herb, lemon oil, pimiento and olive supporting citrus and fresh apple fruit."
Palouse,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,44.5,2,"This wine comes from one of the producer's oldest blocks in Carneros, where grapes retain vibrant acidity. Reduced on the nose, it opens up into a mix of fennel, preserved lemon and almond aromas that follow through on the steely palate with grace."
Palouse,Syrah,90.0,36.0,1,"This distinctive, complex and layered wine brings a unique aromatic profile of raspberries, sage and spice before fanning out across the palate with gorgeous raspberry syrup, dark chocolate and blackberry flavors. Its lightly grippy texture of fine-grained tannins perfectly counters the plush effusiveness of its fruit."
Palumbo Family Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,52.0,1,"Made entirely from Chardonnay grapes grown in one site, the inaugural vintage of this cuvée is delicious. It offers a rich core of almond paste flavor, with inviting peach, apple and pear fruit tones, all while remaining light, bright and highlighted with wet stone and gravel."
Palumbo Family Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,52.0,1,"A collaboration between Sonoma County-based winemaker Jesse Katz and Ken Forrester of South Africa, this 100% varietal red is robust and rich. Dark cherry, red currant and integrated oak flavors support its bold body."
Palumbo Family Vineyards,Sangiovese,89.0,45.0,1,"Quite dry and thin, with an odd mix of unripe fruit, sugary fruit, toasted seed and plastic. Just doesn't sit well in the mouth."
Palumbo Family Vineyards,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,45.0,1,"Sourced from old-vine Bacchus and Weinbau fruit, this also includes 20% grapes from the estate's Heather Hill vineyard. The aromas are dense and penetrating, with a powerful mix of black fruits, ripe berries, smoke, earth, olive and coffee. From the first sniff to the last swallow, the flavors are beautifully integrated and the effect symphonic."
Pam's Cuties,Chardonnay,83.0,4.0,1,"Deep gold, the color of honey, picked at 53° brix, this is unbelievably dense and concentrated. Yet with the acidity in place, this wine has balance, support, and depth. It's not a fat, sugary blob. This drinks like a Canadian icewine. Honey, tropical fruits, candied orange, butterscotch, butter and toasted nuts—it just keeps on going."
Pamplin,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.5,32.0,8,"A blend of nearly two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it brings notes of herbs, vanilla extract, cherry and chocolate. The wood plays a big part in the show, at times getting out in front of the fruit."
Pamplin,Red Blend,91.0,30.0,1,"With 22% Merlot blended, it's direct and appealing with notes of black tea, cherry, leafy greens and bittersweet chocolate. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a pleasing sense of balance and a slightly gritty feel to the tannins."
Panache Cellars,Pinot Noir,90.0,30.0,1,"Aromatic in black cherry and herb, this is a smooth, round Merlot that'll please many palates, balanced in pleasant fruity tones and vanilla oak."
Panther Creek,Chardonnay,88.0,45.0,2,"This is an enjoyable wine with notes of cherry lozenge, dried cranberry, coffee and herbs. It's lower in alcohol but with a weighty feel to the chocolaty fruit flavors."
Panther Creek,Pinot Noir,89.88,43.88,26,"A blend of 85% Petite Sirah and 15% Petit Verdot, this is a mouthful of intense, smoky blueberry and leather. Licorice and tar intermingle on the midpalate with the finish decisively earthy in graphite."
Papapietro Perry,Chardonnay,92.0,49.0,1,"Crisp with a taste of New Zealand grass, this wine offers pear, lemon and a pinch of fig on the finish amid layers of acidity."
Papapietro Perry,Pinot Noir,90.57,63.86,7,"This blend of Roussanne (33%), Grenache Blanc (30%), Viognier (22%) and Marsanne has light aromas of apricot, citrus and flowers. The flavors are similarly restrained but it shows a sense of balance and length that holds the attention. Drinks best at 60 degrees."
Paradise Peak,Gewürztraminer,83.0,9.0,1,"Aromas of baking spices, clove, vanilla and dark fruit lead to a nuanced palate with fruit and barrel flavors and a light grip of tannins. The alcohol shows through a bit but overall it holds it."
Paradise Peak,Riesling,85.0,10.0,1,"High-toned aromas of dried herbs, cocoa, licorice, woodspice and blackberry lead to full-bodied yet elegantly styled black fruit flavors, with the tannins showing some grit."
Paradise Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,65.0,2,"Light aromas of flowers, dried herbs and barrel spices lead to velvety cherry and chocolate flavors that have a fine sense of presence, but could use a bit more tannic structure to stitch them together."
Paradise Ridge,Chardonnay,91.0,40.0,1,"Lees aromas mix with notes of custard, poached pear, cinnamon and well-integrated barrel accents. The palate shows a sense of finesse and grace that carries through the finish."
Paradise Ridge,Pinot Noir,88.0,56.0,1,Good balance and slightly lean fruit and spice flavors make an agreeable combo in this medium-bodied and nicely tangy wine. Whiffs of cinnamon and earth go with cherry and rhubarb flavors.
Paradise Ridge,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,24.0,1,"A light-bodied wine that is blended with 8% Carignane and 4% Petite Sirah, the whole aged nearly two years in French and American oak. There's a thread of minty eucalyptus lurking in this wine, which is lean on the palate, with a suggestion of raspberry and blackberry."
Paraduxx,Red Blend,88.92,68.38,13,"The clonal selection related to the regional pioneer is the most interesting thing about this bottling, which is incredibly light and delicate, so much so that there is not tons of flavor. The nose shows very faint apple skins and key lime, and the palate barely offers pear skins and slate, though there is an intriguing texture."
Paraduxx,White Blend,91.0,30.0,1,"Dark-colored and deeply fruity, this medium-bodied wine tastes like Bing cherry juice and black plums, and feels plush rather than tannic on the palate."
Paraiso Vineyards,Pinot Noir,88.0,22.0,1,"Chaparral scrub and hibiscus combine on the rather light and dainty nose. Iron, tart cranberry and riper pomegranate pop on the palate, which has good energy and is fairly straightforward and simple."
Parallel,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.5,146.5,2,"Plum, spice and sweet herb aromas lead to rounded blue-fruit flavors surrounded by dry, astringent tannins that are unyielding."
Paratus,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,125.0,1,"This pink wine, originally started by figure skater Peggy Fleming as a benefit for breast cancer research, shows peach, nectarine, strawberry flesh and cotton candy aromas. There is a touch of sweetness to the sip, with baked orange and lemon curd flavors."
Parducci,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,14.0,2,"Ripe and accessible, this Klipsun Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc includes 20% Sémillon in the blend. Melon and light citrus flavors abound, with enough acidity to keep it fresh and lively."
Parducci,Pinot Noir,85.0,14.0,2,"One of the strongest aromas of beets I have smelled in a wine; also some vanilla and cream nuances. Tasty and satisfying, if a bit one-dimensional."
Parejas Cellars,Rhône-style White Blend,86.0,16.0,1,"Very tight in the nose, with hints of peanuts. A cinnamon nuance provides an exotic edge to the otherwise straightforward, somewhat tart cherry palate. Buttery oak and more tangy cherries dominate the finish."
Paris Valley Road Cellars,Red Blend,86.0,14.0,1,"Very lively and jumpy, with bright cherry fruit supported by high-voltage acidity. It hits the high notes, but lacks the bass below, and therefore is ultimately a bit out of balance. Very much a cherry-fruit dominated, one-dimensional wine"
Parker,Barbera,87.0,28.0,1,"At first the aroma is sharp, even clumsy, showing herbs, peanuts and even bacon fat. The fruit is in the big-plum range. A heavy dose of oak has been thrown at this wine, so it’s buttery on the palate and coffee-tinged on the finish."
Parker,Chardonnay,93.0,28.0,1,"Lovely scents of blue and black berries open into an excellent wine from this well-known vineyard. Cherry cola and molasses flesh out the midpalate flavors, and the fruit has a brambly quality that is almost like Zinfandel. Expressive and detailed."
Parker,Red Blend,88.0,36.0,1,"Abacela's tenth vintage of Tempranillo suggests it's time to call the “experiment” a success. It's savory and scented with cured meats; a spicy red that marries black currant fruit to pepper and more exotic spices—curry, cumin and five spice. Tannins are tongue-scrapingly dry, but is there a better match for a thick steak?"
Parkers Estate,Syrah,82.0,20.0,1,"Black tea, charred cherries and tree bark aromas arise off this wine from a cooler part of a warm appellation. The wine is a bit thin and light on the palate once sipped, with pomegranate fruit. Drink at the beach or with lighter fare."
Parmeson,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,60.0,1,"There's an extreme tightness to this top-end bottling from a premiere vineyard in this newish appellation. The nose is very lean with dark spice, blueberry and purple fruit, and the palate is extremely tannic, making any other flavors fall away. Only time will tell whether the wine is a success."
Parmeson,Chardonnay,90.0,35.0,3,"There's an earthy funkiness to this inexpensive Pinot, made at an unheard-of price point for the area. Dry tannins greet the entry followed up by burly oak and big brambly blackberry and cherry fruit, a touch of herb on the finish."
Parmeson,Pinot Noir,90.0,32.0,2,"Light in texture, this wine shows a fair amount of barrel influence aromatically. On the palate, it's similarly challenging to disregard the oak, which frames a mid-weight body marked by sour cherry."
Parmeson,Sauvignon Blanc,84.0,23.0,1,"A lively and fresh nose of blackberries, black cherries, black pepper, turned earth and fresh fennel greet the nose on this wine that's made by Mike Roth for Greg Martellotto. There are flavors of blackberry-filled licorice spice cake on the palate, though the tannins could use a bit of mellowing."
Parmeson,Zinfandel,88.5,35.0,2,"This is a unique blend of Chardonnay, Viognier, Roussanne and Orange Muscat. Aromas of pear, almond, white flowers and orange peel lead to off-dry fruit flavors that have a full, lightly oily feel."
Paro,Malbec,86.0,35.0,1,"This soft, light-bodied wine is on the savory side, a taste of cranberry and rhubarb at its core. It dances in cooler-climate aspects of forest floor and herb, with an unexpected aroma of menthol sneaking into the mix."
Paro,Pinot Noir,85.0,31.67,3,"All varietal coming from Dwelley and Minnick Hills vineyards, this wine leads with aromas of black licorice, dates and green herbs. There's plenty of richness to the flavors, which are backed by a squeeze of grainy tannins."
Paro,White Blend,90.0,26.0,1,"Very tight and shy aromas of lime zest, gray slate and white rocks show on the nose of this wine from the pioneering Niven Family and their winemaker Christian Roguenant. The palate shows some grassiness, Mexican lime and an interesting warmth on the back end, proving quite lean and sharp."
Paro,Zinfandel,86.0,30.0,1,"This is a tight and racy take on a rarely planted grape for the region. with scratched lemon peel and lime pith aromas, plus a brie cheese-rind character. It's lively on the palate, with grapefruit peels, white flowers, lime juice and a touch of ripe apple flesh. Expect longevity."
Parrish Family,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,57.5,2,"Merlot dominant with a balance of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine shows aromas of vanilla, coconut and jammy red and black fruit, with the alcohol poking through. The fruit flavors feel supple, backed by gritty tannins."
Parrish Family,Red Blend,92.5,49.0,2,"With the two varieties co-fermented in concrete, this has no oak to interfere with its aromas of spice, pear and honeysuckle. It drinks off dry, seeming a bit sweeter than recent vintages, but still bringing the acidity that this region is known for."
Paschal,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,25.0,1,"Sweet oak aromas, ripe fruit flavors and a firm texture make a complete and enjoyable package in this full-bodied wine. It has a toasted oak flavor, tasty plum and cinnamon nuances, good acidity and supportive tannins."
Paschal,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,28.0,1,"The oak (21 months spent in French and American) takes the lead, with aromas of baking spices, green wood and vanilla out in front of cherry. The flavors are sweet, supported by grainy tannins that show some dryness."
Paschal,Chardonnay,88.0,18.0,1,"This wine is principally Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with the balance other Bordeaux varieties. Aromas of clove, sweet plum, vanilla and tire rubber lead to sweet, palate-coating blueberry and smoke flavors that linger."
Paschal,Pinot Noir,86.0,24.0,1,"Homer is the reserve cuvée, a barrel-selection seemingly chosen for a bit of extra concentration. It retains its elegance, with scents of lavender, incense and Asian spices leading into bright, intense flavors of cherry and plum. The wine gathers itself in the midpalate, showing that fruit density, and finishes with a lick of chocolate. Drink 2018–2030."
Paskett,Charbono,87.0,27.0,1,"Sourced from a vineyard planted by Gary Andrus in 1998, this elegant and expressive wine is shaded a lovely rose tone, and scents of rose petals and ripe cherries emerge instantly from the glass. It's well defined, balanced and detailed with sandalwood, cocoa powder, cinnamon and orange-liqueur highlights. Drink now through 2021."
Passaggio,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,62.0,1,"This is a boldly expressive testament to the vineyard site from which it comes. A concentrated and lushly textured wine, it exudes lime and a hit of tropical papaya buoyed as it goes by bristling acidity and a hint of wild vanilla. Indicative of a ripe, warm vintage, it remains balanced and deliciously exuberant from start to finish."
Passaggio,Chardonnay,85.0,34.0,1,"Young and tight, this is packed with bright berry fruit annotated with brown spices. There are streaks of sandalwood and mocha, and the flavors smooth out nicely as it glides into a lingering, delicious finish."
Passaggio,Merlot,88.5,53.5,2,"Among the impressive single-vineyard Adelsheim Pinots, this is the only one from this tiny AVA. It's loaded with bright, sparky cranberry and raspberry fruit, whose juicy flavors hit the palate's bullseye. The penetrating power is underscored with minerally acidity. Drink now through 2030."
Passaggio,Pinot Noir,86.67,47.67,3,"Initially this may strike some tasters as an unusual expression, but give it a chance and it may well become a favorite. There's an interesting component of crushed flowers in aroma and flavor, along with nut oil, butterscotch, pineapple and apple butter. It's all supported by a mineral-driven vein."
Passaggio,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,28.0,1,"Stone, mineral and metal highlights combine around tight cranberry and raspberry fruit. Concentrated and compact, this distinctive bottling is bone-dry. Drink 2020–2030."
Passaggio,White Blend,88.0,24.0,1,"This is a blend of several marquee vineyards, including Gap's Crown, Martinelli and Widdoes. It comes together nicely in a mix of fig and baked bread, peppered in baking spices and dried herb. Cherry comes through along with subtle hints of violet and rose, before a long, lingering finish ties things in a juicy bow at the end."
Passion Vineyards,Merlot,86.0,22.0,1,"Featuring the Wädenswil clone, this block selection carries a whiff of wintergreen and lavender. That minty lift elevates the palate's pretty cherry fruit. It's a harmonious wine, with perfectly proportioned acids and a faint truffle note as it fades gracefully."
Passion Vineyards,Red Blend,88.0,25.0,1,"Good concentration and clear varietal flavors mark this excellent Washington Mourvèdre. The mixed red fruits are well integrated, with a strong vein of mineral, and a finishing wash of vanilla, coffee and chocolate. Lots of barrel flavors to be sure, but the fruit can take it."
Pat Paulsen Vineyards,Red Blend,85.0,26.0,1,"A Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Merlot, this bright and grapy effort pleasingly integrates slightly rougher notes of earth, leaf and stem. It all works here, adding texture and detail to the tart berry fruits. Drink in the next 3–5 years."
Pat Paulsen Vineyards,Syrah,83.0,24.0,1,"This is a proper El Dorado Zin. It's still tight and tannic, but air and time reveal a lovely bouquet of lavender and crushed herbs that's layered, soft and spicy on the finish. Miraflores is making some lovely wines and this is one worth seeking out."
Patit Creek Cellars,Red Blend,86.0,28.0,1,"This pure Malbec carries spicy, slightly gamy scents similar to Syrah. Forward purple fruits fill the mouth, accented with notes of licorice, moist earth and dried herb. The finish leaves an impression of maple syrup, which is quite delicious."
Patit Creek Cellars,Riesling,88.0,16.0,1,Strong aromas of charred oak and equally boisterous smoked meat flavors give this wine a rowdy personality. It has medium body but full-throttle aromas like rubber tires and flavors like Concord grapes.
Patland,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,131.0,9,"This wine seems quite evolved for its age, with aromas of leather and dried cranberry. It's light bodied with gritty tannins."
Patland,Malbec,89.33,76.67,3,"This seems like it came from a considerably cooler vintage and also like it has had some age. Light aromas of herb, wood spice, medicine cabinet, leather and mesquite are followed by tart light-bodied cranberry flavors. The tannins bring a slight sense of astringency."
Patland,Red Blend,90.67,68.33,3,"This is an unusual example of this variety, with aromas of exotic spice, flowers and herb. The palate has tart cranberry flavors that seem lacking in concentration."
Patland,Rosé,87.0,38.0,1,Aromas of Bosc pear and candle wax lead to off-dry fruit flavors. It brings some easy-drinking appeal but lacks a sense of clarity.
Patland,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,48.0,1,"Aromas of white flowers, lychee and grapefruit peel lead to dry fruit flavors that seem to lack concentration, with a bitter note on the finish."
Patland,Syrah,90.0,78.33,3,Aromas of herb and red fruit lead to dried out but lightly gamy fruit flavors.
Patricia Green Cellars,Pinot Noir,93.22,48.78,9,"This wine is a blend of Riesling (70%) and Gewürztraminer. It brings aromas of pear, lychee and white flowers that are followed by an off-dry palate. It needs some more acidity to pull it all together."
Patterson,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,34.0,2,"A pretty faded rose color, this delicate wine shows very light raspberry and cherry fruit, with moderate, tea-flavored tannins, and barrel-generated streaks of coffee and dark chocolate."
Patterson,Malbec,89.0,36.0,1,"Pinkish-gold in color, this is a faint, dry and herbal rosé that's pungent in fuzzy stone fruit such as peach and apricot. Made entirely from Pinot Noir grapes, it's light and bright, with a finish of tart grapefruit."
Patterson,Red Blend,86.0,17.0,3,"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Carignane offers aromas of ripe wild berries and bit of hickory smoke. The ripe, approachable flavors are edged by vanilla, with boysenberry fruit at the core. It's not complicated, but very easy to drink, perfect for a hamburger barbecue."
Patterson,Rhône-style Red Blend,85.0,25.0,1,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and—surprise!—Zinfandel, this brings a swirl of red fruits into play, and wraps them in a skin of bark and slightly bitter earth. Peppery tannins and more forest floor flavors kick in at the finish."
Patterson,Roussanne,92.0,22.0,1,"This is a soft, complex and floral wine, sourced from an estate vineyard on Westside Road. Black cherry, tangerine and oak reduction make for a bright, brooding combination of medium-bodied lushness and subtle power."
Patterson,Syrah-Petite Sirah,88.0,32.0,1,"Plump strawberry and black cherry fruit provide power, but elegance is what carries this bottling, thanks to its well-integrated rose and hibiscus aromas. Cooked raspberry and ripe pomegranate notes make for a rich palate, but floral rosewater touches complete the picture. This packs punch while still being approachable in style."
Patterson,White Blend,87.0,21.67,6,"Smoked beef and pork aromas with hints of flint, licorice and black currant show on the nose of this 45% Syrah, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Petit Verdot blend. The palate is soft upon entry, growing sticky with robust tannins as it opens, and offering black peppercorn, teriyaki and lavish black cherry flavors. Drink 2019–2033."
Patton Valley,Pinot Noir,90.11,56.0,9,"Dense and concentrated, this wine is ultra smooth in texture, offering an abundance of red and black cherry, dark plum and baking spice aromas. One of the few Pinots grown in Marin County, it has great depth and a memorable flavor profile that lingers long into the finish."
Patton Valley,Rosé,86.0,16.0,1,"One of the first producers to work with Bucher Vineyard fruit, this shows familiarity and comfort in its ability to coax black cherry, pomegranate and allspice flavors, wrapping them in a voluptuous mouthfeel. Full-bodied and lushly layered, it's lengthy with a touch of smoke."
Patz & Hall,Chardonnay,93.73,55.64,11,"From the BudBreak Vineyard, this lengthy and complex wine is bold and fresh—an exploration of cranberry and orange flavors complemented by spicy acidity. It continues to unveil itself in the glass, revealing additional components of toasted oak and forest mushroom."
Patz & Hall,Pinot Noir,93.29,72.86,14,"This blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache and Petite Sirah is quite dark in the glass, with blueberry, sharp cedar, clove and vanilla aromas. It coats the palate with soft, lavish tannins, offering zesty black fruit with cappuccino, teriyaki and cracked pepper flavors."
Paul Hobbs,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.5,175.0,2,"This wine is crisp, floral and pretty in every way. It's classically structured and graceful, with tart apple notes and stony acidity. It allows the fruit to speak softly and subtly, its lower ripeness detracting from niether flavor nor complexity."
Paul Hobbs,Chardonnay,94.4,78.0,5,"Another Joe Davis wine that's benefited from patience, this bottling offers more mature character than the same vineyard's 2009. Umami touches of soy, shiitake and leather underscore the cherry and raspberry scents on the nose. It has a grippy texture and a subtly presented range of flavors—from dried anise and Christmas spice to elderberry, cranberry and dried plum skin."
Paul Hobbs,Pinot Noir,96.0,85.0,1,"From near Olivet Lane and Pellegrini Vineyard—some of the longest planted sites in the appellation—this red is densely packed with spicy, wild black and red fruit, with a soft underbelly of structure. Earthy mushroom and forest pine give it a savory dimension, through soft, silky waves of texture."
Paul Mathew,Chardonnay,88.0,35.0,1,"There's a great deal of sagebrush on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard in the eastern Sta. Rita Hills, along with red cherry, pencil lead and sandalwood. Dark cherry and cranberry flavors power the palate, the fruit wrapped in hickory smoke. Thyme flavors carry into the tannic finish."
Paul Mathew,Pinot Noir,91.33,46.67,3,"An uber aromatic wine with notes of flowers, orange peel, jasmine and canned peaches. At 27.2 g/L residual sugar, it drinks medium sweet but overall, the acid keeps it in check."
Paul O'Brien,Chardonnay-Pinot Blanc,88.0,26.0,1,"A pretty label created by film production designer Dean Tavoularis graces the bottle of this wine. It offers a mix of tight-grained tannin, cherry cola and smoky oak."
Paul O'Brien,Pinot Noir,91.0,45.0,1,"Charred oak, barbecue smoke and a hint of prune detract somewhat in this tart, herbal wine that offers a suggestion of cola. It finishes somewhat flat."
Paul O'Brien,Riesling,92.0,26.0,2,"Pure Chardonnay, Luxe is finished at lower alcohol (at least according to the fact sheets) than the other sparklers in this lineup. It is definitely the wine with the most depth; it has a roundly fruity core of lemon cake and light citrus."
Paul O'Brien,Rosé,89.0,26.0,2,"Soft and dense with dark fruit, almost baked fruit flavors, that veer into nuts and vanilla, an easy-drinking Zin blended with a smidge of Zin from the 2009 and 2010 vintages as well as 7% Petite Sirah crafted by a Lodi producer to watch."
Paul O'Brien,Tempranillo,89.0,44.0,3,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced from Gamache, Stillwater Creek and Red Mountain vineyards. Berry, cherry and plum fruit flavors fill the mouth, gaining strength and detail as they broaden out across the palate. Highlights of loam and tobacco fill in the finish, with just a slight suggestion of alcohol burn."
Paumanok,Chardonnay,84.0,10.0,1,"Two thirds Grenache, the rest a mix of Tempranillo, Syrah and Counoise, this smooth and fruity red has a pleasing, lively mouthfeel. It carries a hint of moist, clean earth, and finishes with a lick of mocha."
Paumanok,Riesling,83.0,15.0,1,"This Cab opens with soy and molasses and then moves seamlessly into a mouthful of blackberry jam. Dense, it's still young but should develop well."
Pavillion Crossing,Cabernet Sauvignon,83.0,14.0,1,"Stiff and tart, this young wine needs a few more years of cellaring to fill itself out. The balance is right, and the vineyard's full-bodied tannins are there in abundance."
Pavillion Crossing,Merlot,85.0,13.0,2,"A classic from the first sniff to the last swallow, this Bordeaux blend, made for Lachini by winemaker Jamie Brown, offers tangy red fruits, pepper, toast and earth highlights, with a base of green olive and brown spices. All in all, a fascinating wine with subtle variations on the Bordeaux theme."
Peace Water,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,76.0,2,"This vintage of the Darkness Syrah is framed in an elegant, acid-driven, vintage-specific style. There is plenty of fruit—dark and roasted, with a mix of berries, pepper, and a splash of citrus—but the overall flavor set is highlighted by its acidity, and supported by earthy tannins. A fine food wine, with some years of life ahead."
Peace Water,Chardonnay,91.0,32.0,1,"A fine bottle — full, fleshy, immediately throwing out dense aromatics with toast and roasted coffee and bitter chocolate components. A deep vein of black cherry and cassis keeps the core tight and focused, and a small splash of Syrah adds the scent of black pepper."
Peace Water,Pinot Noir,88.0,28.0,1,"Deeply colored, this bottling shows ripe blackberry pie with caramel, crushed graphite and a touch of mint on the nose. The tannins are soft but provide just enough structure to deliver lavish flavors of black cherry, beef char and cedar."
Peace Water,Red Blend,90.0,35.0,1,"Intensely ripe, jammy and toasty aromas and equally effusive fruit flavors make this full-bodied wine easy to enjoy. It seems to overflow with boysenberry and blackberry, and has a touch of wood smoke from oak."
Peace Water,Rosé,86.0,21.0,2,"Vivacious and juicy blackberry flavors are spiced by cola and root beer on the nose of this annual fund-raising bottling by Raymond Smith, and it also shows a touch of chalk on the nose. River stones and gravel minerality are present on the sip, with fresh black plum, more blackberry and dried mint rounding it out."
Peace Water,Sauvignon Blanc,88.33,25.33,3,"Nicely ripe fruit flavors and a full rounded texture give this affordably priced wine more presence than most. The aroma is honeydew melon and the flavors are ripe apple and Anjou pear, while the acidity is on the soft side."
Peachy Canyon,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,55.0,1,"This big blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Sangiovese presents a potent purple-flower aroma on the nose as well as boysenberry, tar, dried oregano, pepper and leather. The bone-dry palate is wrapped in a chalky silky texture, with nettle, oregano and blackberry flavors."
Peachy Canyon,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,19.0,2,"This medium-bodied wine is already drinking optimally, with a core of red fruit streaked with cola, earth, graphite and citrus notes. Only four barrels were produced."
Peachy Canyon,Viognier,90.0,25.5,2,"The blend is 85% Viognier and 15% Roussanne, and finishes off-dry with 1.5% residual sugar. A slight blush color and mixed fruit flavors of melon and pear carry the wine, which has a definite sugary sweetness in the mouth. There is also an impression of celery, believe it or not, making for an unusual mix that will intrigue some tasters, and confuse others."
Peachy Canyon,Zinfandel,89.04,31.38,24,"Juicy and tart, this estate-grown Sauvignon Blanc has a pleasing mix of light melon, lime, white peach and grapefruit flavors. Hints of sweet grass and a suggestion of sweetness, like lemonade, fill out the finish."
Peake Ranch,Chardonnay,93.0,40.0,1,"Sappy, tannic and loaded with plum and blueberry, some cassis and chocolate. A good follow-up to the previous vintage, with very dark fruit, polished tannins and a lengthy, tasty finish of chocolate-covered cherries."
Pear Valley,Albariño,86.0,21.0,2,"Fresh, lightly pétillant, and scented with hints of clover and spice, this elegant dry Riesling offers light fruit flavors of pear, citrus, stone and herb. It loses momentum and fades rather quickly in the mouth."
Pear Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.5,35.0,2,"This is the producer's annual unoaked version of the variety, from its own estate, the grapes fermented entirely in stainless steel. Kept in tank until bottling, it's a fresh taste of spring, also showing green olive, quince and tropical mango, with plenty of juicy acidity."
Pear Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.25,27.25,4,"Grapefruit, orange and cherry mélange nicely together on the palate of this tantalizingly zesty wine, the acidity front and forward. Fresh and refreshing, the tang mellows on the finish, providing medium body and weight."
Pear Valley,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,22.0,1,"Lighter aromas of turned earth, dried blueberries and beef jerky show on the nose of this blend of 34% Merlot, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petite Sirah and 15% Petit Verdot. The palate packs bright black raspberries and blackberries together with graphite and light cedar notes."
Pear Valley,Viognier,87.0,21.0,1,"Dark hay in color with a concentration of oak on the nose, the palate retains that richness of nutty almond and apple pie, finding a balance that betrays the heavier implications of the initial aromas. On the finish it offers a lightness of being, as well as a touch of perfume."
Pear Valley,Zinfandel,90.0,19.0,1,"A 100% varietal wine from one vineyard, this wine opens in cinnamon stick and blackberry jam, leading the way to chocolatey leather on the palate offset by tingling acidity. Currant, blueberry and cedar also make appearances atop a full-body and lengthy, concentrated finish."
Pearl and Stone,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.5,34.0,2,Too much tobacco on this wine that comes off as slightly overripe and sweet.
Pearl and Stone,Cabernet Franc,94.0,45.0,1,"Not a lot of aromas in this 14.9% old-vine Zin, though a touch of fruit shows up mid-palate. Pretty so-so."
Pech Merle,Pinot Noir,90.0,38.0,2,"So incredibly big and meaty, this old-vine Zinfandel lists itself at 15.8% alcohol and is indeed sweet but not jammy."
Pech Merle,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,21.0,1,"This might be an example of a wine that's too low in alcohol (13.1%). Two bottles were tasted and both came off as very soft and a tad bland, even waxy."
Pech Merle,Syrah,88.0,23.0,4,"are starting to recognize Clarksburg, for growing some amazingly flavorful Chenin Blanc and Albarino, but if it's Chardonnay they want to grow, too, this wine won't help make the case. From the Wilson Vineyard, it's sweet and uncomplicated and tasting a bit burnt."
Pech Merle,Viognier,90.0,33.0,1,"Not showing very well and smelling like sweet soda. Spring for Klinker Brick's 2008 Old Ghost instead, a much more stellar version of Lodi old-vine Zin, double the price but worth every additional dollar."
Pech Merle,Zinfandel,86.0,35.0,2,"Perhaps an unrepresentative bottle (just one was submitted), but this 2008 reserve was muddy in the glass and flabby in the mouth. Oaky and buttery to an extreme degree, it had lost all freshness and fruit."
Peconic Bay Winery,Chardonnay,84.5,22.0,2,"Mirabelle is the darkest, chewiest, most tannic of the three clonal selection Pinots offered by Vidon. It's a Pinot in Cab clothing. Chewy, dense, ripe fruit keeps it all in proportion, a thick black cherry core with rings of chocolate. Think Saturn in a glass."
Pedroncelli,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.5,27.0,2,"Steely and stony in texture and underlying minerality, this medium-bodied effort shows a wealth of floral aromatics, along with lighthearted melon and green apple. A lushness to the finish is welcoming and complex."
Pedroncelli,Merlot,89.0,16.0,1,"Although it's 100% varietal and comes from one of the state's oldest Cabernet vineyards, this wine is somewhat blue-fruited for the variety, with notes of plum and mountain blueberry along with herb, graphite, espresso and spice. The palate shows more of the same, bringing a sense of restraint and polish along with lightly grainy tannins that need some time to stretch their legs. It doesn't scream Cabernet but it still brings plenty of appeal. Best after 2022."
Pedroncelli,Pinot Noir,83.0,20.0,1,"Moderate in structure, full bodied and ripe, this wine is tightly wound in firm, strong tannin. Light flavors of cherry and orange integrate spiky accents of clove, tea and dried herb."
Pedroncelli,Sauvignon Blanc,86.5,14.5,4,"The aromas are bright, with notes of savory herb, orange peel, cranberry and spice. The flavors are higher in acidity, tart and puckering, with orange-peel flavors lingering on the finish. The tannins seem a little crunchy right now but should soften with some additional time in the bottle. It's a stylistically unique wine for the state. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
Pedroncelli,White Blend,86.0,12.0,2,"This blends 84% Merlot, 11% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot, the three varieties combining to full-bodied effect. Earthy in mushroom and cedar, its texture is leathery, with the palate dotted in tobacco and black pepper, the character savory and full of spice."
Pedroncelli,Zinfandel,88.33,16.5,6,"Medium in build and lengthy with layers of flavor, this vineyard-designate offers a wealth of rhubarb, pomegranate, cherry and black tea, the background built around strong notions of forest floor."
Peirano,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.5,12.5,2,"A 100% Syrah aged for 18 months in two-thirds new French oak, this wine offers damp truffle earth aromas around burly layers of cigar box and spicy, gamy blackberry and plum. Potent, with a long finish, it's worth aging through 2022."
Peirano,Chardonnay,85.5,12.0,2,"This delivers the best of both worlds for this aromatic grape. Crispy cut-grass notes blossom into tropical pineapple guava and green papaya. A laser focus of lime on the palate subsequently opens toward green pears, freshly cut oregano and dill, and an apple skin-driven bitterness."
Peirano,Malbec,83.0,13.0,2,"Exuberantly juicy blackberry and blueberry intermingle in this midweight wine, undeterred by oak. Well-integrated, the tannins make a play on the finish, competing with dusty chocolate and mocha, a dustiness that takes on rocky minerality, recalling this wine's terroir."
Peirano,Merlot,84.0,12.0,1,"This is the winery's reserve-level 100% Cab, given the utmost care and attention. It opens shyly in cedar and blackberry before offering a luscious palate of tangy leather, dry, firm tannins and a peppery finish. From grapes designated as their own Heritage Clone, UCD 30, it beautifully expresses the appellation and should cellar well through 2020."
Peirano,Moscato,87.0,12.67,3,"Just two barrels were made, from the vineyard's 1972-era planting. This all-Pommard clone selection delivers extra nuances of leaf and bramble to a wine of medium density. The strawberry/cherry preserve fruit flavors are concentrated and rich, and the time in French oak has brought light flavors of caramel, chocolate and toasted hazelnuts into the finish."
Peirano,Petite Sirah,83.5,13.0,2,"From a blending of two barrels—one new and one neutral—this is a snappy, sappy, tangy wine with ripe, forward red and purple fruits. These notes are framed with pretty barrel toast, and the tannins are firm, ripe and balanced. Drink now with pleasure or tuck it away until 2020."
Peirano,Red Blend,82.33,13.0,3,"Flavors of baked strawberry and raspberry provide a concentrated richness to this wine, accented by earthy, subtle baking spice. Layered in well-managed tannins, it offers substantial body without the weight, staying structured on the palate, before an intensity of oak and more spice bursts on the finish."
Peirano,Syrah,86.5,12.5,2,"Sizable tannin, weight and oak suggest cellaring this wine through 2019. The time will be well spent developing this wine's generously robust and vibrant swirls of wild strawberry, black cherry and baking spices. Bright acidity and floral aromas of violet and rose complete the lovely package."
Peirano,Tempranillo,86.0,13.0,3,"Cranberry, cardamom, earthy mushroom, loam and a bit of smoke power the nose of this wine from one of the appellation's pioneers. The flavors are more subtle, with Bing cherry and raspberry fruit accented by notes of clove, plum skin and turned earth."
Peirano,Viognier,86.0,12.33,3,"This wine, which is bolstered with 4% Petite Sirah and 2% Viognier, shows aromas of tar, charred beef and white pepper. That spice shows strongly on the vibrant palate, with crushed peppercorns dominating in a pleasant way, alongside black sage and other dark herbs."
Peirano,White Blend,88.0,13.0,2,"The historic Pritchard Hill producer swings for the fences with this Cab, intense in black cherry, blackberry and cedar. Hard to penetrate on first try, it demands cellaring to soften its wall of hearty tannins, the merest hint of chocolate-coffee begging to break out. Lushly powerful and complex, it can be enjoyed through 2027."
Peirano,Zinfandel,85.33,12.67,3,"Incredibly inviting aromas of boysenberry-blackberry pie, deep red raspberry, anise and tobacco greet the nose. This wine is soft on the palate, with cherry and berry fruit that give way to layer upon layer of black sage, licorice, espresso, mocha dust and dark chocolate chips."
Peju,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,30.0,1,"A lighter shade of ruby red in the glass, this wine by young vintner Gavin Chanin—whose original art adorns the label—shows delicate aromas of whole cranberries, shaved fennel and dried tobacco. Pomegranate and cranberry fruits arise on the palate, but pine sap flavors are more prominent, along with licorice and eucalyptus. A strong tannic backbone for such a light wine indicates it will drink amazingly from 2018–2030."
Peju,Cabernet Franc,90.0,115.0,1,"This single-vineyard selection shines, with nuanced layers of granite, lead pencil, pepper and espresso around a core of dense black cherry and cassis. The power and concentration mark it as special. Still compact and lightly earthy, it's blessed with perfectly ripe and proportionate tannins, ensuring a good long life ahead."
Peju,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,90.0,95.0,1,"Chocolate-cherry and mocha fill the air and palate in this densely delicious inaugural offering from a new estate, set in the heart of the appellation. At this sister property of the PlumpJack and Cade wineries, with the same owners, there's no skimping on quality. The wine is medium in weight and lengthy, subtle in oak and integrated tannin, with a lovely finish."
Peju,Chardonnay,87.5,28.0,2,"A bouquet of spicy black pepper intoxicates on the opening of this wine, followed by captivating waves of savory blackberry, leather and dust. The grapes are sourced from one of the producer's coolest sites, With well-integrated, unobtrusive oak, the wine is soft and delicious now, offering plenty of meaty undertones, but will intrigue further over time, through 2022."
Peju,Red Blend,86.5,55.0,2,"There's a reason this is one of the pricier white wines from the region. Aromas of yogurt and brie cheese are leveled by struck match, smoked grapefruit skins and sourdough. Vibrant lime pith and singed lemons fuel the palate, which further benefits from crushed oyster shell rockiness and goat cheese-like pungency. The mouth sings with remarkable acidity that will evolve. Drink 2018–2024."
Peju,Sangiovese Cabernet,87.0,55.0,1,"From the producer's estate vineyard, this savory, sultry wine is sublime in peppery, wild game. Its textures are alive and bright in acidity, with piquant black and red berry providing inviting juiciness. Made in small quantities, it's an incredible value for the quality, a wine that will sing on the table, and become more complex in the glass."
Peju,Syrah,88.0,25.0,2,"This powerful, rich and complex wine comes from a low-yielding vineyard that produced just 2.5 tons per acre, and the meticulous label even shows the amount of fog days. Deep and jammy aromas of strawberry preserves, cherry pie, brown sugar, hot licorice and smoked meats give way to a sultry palate that shows nuanced layers of berries, black pepper, mace and baking spice."
Peju Province,Colombard,87.0,20.0,1,"The downtown Santa Barbara winery's luxury-level offering shows wondrous aromas of blackberry, licorice and pepper. The flavors take some patience to show their true colors, but soon reveal blackberry, ollallieberry, some red fruits, wet slate minerality and lavender. Expect those elements to emerge even stronger from 2018 to 2025."
Peju Province Winery,Orange Muscat,92.0,55.0,1,"Winemaker Sabrine Rodems uses the winery's estate vineyard to show cinnamon, Bing cherries, root beer and mace aromas. The flavors of anise, raspberry juice and Earl Grey tea are spruced up by a generous acidity that gives the herb-leaning wine exciting zing."
Pellegrini,Chardonnay,91.0,36.67,3,"This is extreme Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir, from an Annapolis-area vineyard. It's juicy and velvety on the palate, the layered dollops of black tea and savory cardamom accenting crisp orange peel, cranberry and pomegranate. Floral upon entry, the wine proffers subtle yet ample acidity and relatively low alcohol."
Pellegrini,Pinot Noir,89.33,65.0,3,"Deep aromas of black-cherry syrup meet with raisin, leather and fudge on the rustic but inviting nose of this dessert bottling. It's sweet and lavish on the sip, but with impressive grip, showing strawberry and cherry-sauce flavors along with cinnamon and clove spice."
Pellegrini Vineyards,Merlot,84.0,12.0,1,"This full-bodied wine is complex and detailed from the spicy perfume to the finish, and rich and satisfying in the middle. Aromas like black tea and rhubarb lead to ripe and deep cherry and slightly tangy raspberry flavors that are lifted by moderate tannins and linger on the finish."
Pellet Estate,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,125.0,1,"This is a deliciously sultry, luxurious and yet lean, focused white, dark gold in color with tightly woven acidity. Textured and layered in pops of fennel, apple and pear, it was aged in both stainless and neutral French oak, allowing briny minerality and fruit-laden characteristics to shine."
Pellet Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.5,95.0,2,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of barrel spice, black licorice and jammy dark fruit. The cranberry and cherry flavors are palate coating and dense—a hedonistic delight."
Pellet Estate,Chardonnay,93.33,57.33,3,"A youthful expression of the grape, this bottling is clean and fresh on the nose with pressed olallieberries, candied blueberries, violet extract and a nicely smoky char component as well. There is exuberant energy on the sip, where that candied blueberry flavor is cut by savory miso-like flavors. Relatively light and lithe, this would pair with a wide variety of foods."
Pellet Estate,Merlot,93.0,75.0,1,"From fruit grown in Carneros, 74% of it Chardonnay and 26% Pinot Noir, this includes grapes from both Hudson and Hyde vineyards. Gorgeously full bodied and elegant, it's dry on the palate with vibrant acidity to balance the tangy flavors of cherry, pomegranate and cranberry."
Peloton,Albariño,91.0,23.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Merlot (45%), Cabernet Franc (34%), Petit Verdot (8%), Malbec (8%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Brooding aromas of green herbs, flowers and cherry lead to a ripe full-flavored palate that shows a fine sense of balance."
Peltier,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.33,12.67,3,"Welcoming on the nose, this top-end bottling offers aromas of baked red cherry, clove and black plum before diving into crushed graphite, wet slate and loamy mud aromas. Soft on the palate but immediately vibrant with acidity, flavors of dark cranberry and tart cherry are lifted by anise-like spice."
Peltier,Chardonnay,84.33,10.0,3,"Floral like a bouquet of roses, this pretty wine is lined in a tight structure of sinewy earthiness. Orange, cranberry and rhubarb define a crisp, tart profile, while oak makes a sneak, welcome appearance that doesn't overstay its welcome."
Peltier,Petite Sirah,84.5,10.0,2,"One of the least-expensive red blends the winery makes, this bottling of 50% Syrah, 30% Petite Sirah and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon shows blueberry, lavender, violets, ginger snap, oregano, leather, coffee and freshly baked croissant on the nose. It's layered on the sip, with dark chocolate, caramel, black-cherry juice, pork au jus and savory miso flavors."
Peltier,Pinot Grigio,83.67,9.33,3,"This 100% varietal wine hails from Stone Tree, Cold Creek and Beverly vineyards. Aromas of vanilla, chocolate, cherry and raspberry lead to exuberant layered fruit flavors. It displays a lot of intensity, focus, and length."
Peltier,Pinot Noir,83.5,10.0,4,"This intensely sweet and delicious wine has a bright gold color, aromas of buttered popcorn and ripe pear, and flavors like peach, yellow plum and honey. The texture is luscious and thick, but a good sub-current of acidity keeps it balanced."
Peltier,Red Blend,88.0,25.0,1,"Comprised solely of the richer 667 clone, this bottling from the Talley family's iconic vineyard offers juicy blackberry, chipped slate, fennel frond and cola notes on the nose. Smashed black raspberry, strawberry and boysenberry are front-loaded on the palate, but then comes the underlying rush of thyme and anise."
Peltier,Sauvignon Blanc,83.6,9.6,5,"This is a very pretty wine, though not nearly as substantial as the 2009. Fruit flavors of strawberry and light cherry are set over tart acids. The palate softens up a bit and runs through a quick, clean fade."
Peltier,Teroldego,89.5,45.0,2,"This barrel-fermented wine reflects the modest ripeness that marked the 2010 vintage. Scents of almond paste, orange peel, citrus, melon and pear intertwine, and the wine's flavors carry light suggestions of them all, along with a touch of caramel. It's drinking well right now, so why wait?"
Peltier,Vermentino,83.0,8.0,1,"Michael David continues to showcase some of the more unusual grape varieties. This Tannat is big shouldered, rich and decadent, and it tastes brambly, which Zinfandel fans will appreciate. It's full of jammy red fruit and leather notes, with a long finish."
Peltier,Zinfandel,82.0,18.0,1,"With 4% Petite Sirah blended in, the Big John Zin is bright in dusty red fruit, briary and brambly, with a hint of spice and nutty almond. Focused and textured, the finish is fully satisfying, the spice piquing interest again."
Pence Ranch,Chardonnay,92.0,36.0,1,"Previously labeled as Les Gourmandises, this is now The Long Run in honor of Scott Wright's completing his first full-length marathon in 2011. It's all Nysa vineyard fruit, graceful and delicate, scented with rose water and satin smooth. Cranberry and wild strawberry fruit accents lead into a mouthful of cherry soda, delicate but lingering."
Pence Ranch,Pinot Noir,93.0,56.0,1,"A meaty, gamy Syrah boasting aromas of bacon and duck-liver mousse, this wine delivers tremendous flavor and quality for the price. It offers plenty of body around a core of plush, savory tannins and a long finish of pepper and cinnamon spice. Start slicing the charcuterie."
Pence Ranch,Syrah,88.0,50.0,1,"This tight, classic Russian River Valley Pinot Noir needs coaxing to bring out the lovely, lilting aromatics, splendid in savory dark fruit, cinnamon and tobacco. Restrained use of new oak brings a balance of richness and acidity, softened tannins and velvety texture that works in every way."
Pend d'Oreille,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,28.0,1,"This is a block selection from the principal estate vineyard. At first flavors of soda cracker, with a saline edge, fill the palate. Then apple, pear and melon fruit come in, with excellent concentration and refreshing acidity."
Penguin Bay,Chardonnay,84.0,14.0,1,"This is crisply defined, dotted with cinnamon, and features tart pomegranate,  cranberry and strawberry fruit. The sleek tannins frame a long, sturdy finish."
Penguin Bay,Riesling,84.0,14.0,1,"This Pinot is joyous in fresh berry fruit aromas and flavors, from wild strawberry to taut cherry, the fruit buoyed by lush, velvety tannins and generous acidity. Pretty on the nose and tongue, it discloses a trace of vanilla on the clean, distinct finish."
Penner-Ash,Pinot Noir,92.12,76.88,8,"This old-vine (planted 1972) Pinot offers delicate, yet complex details throughout the palate. It's elegant winemaking at its best—a pinpoint mix of herb, stone, berry and barrel—seamless and precise. Despite (or perhaps because of?) the low alcohol, this has the potential to age; try after 2018."
Penner-Ash,Pinot Noir-Syrah,88.0,24.0,1,"At first smelling like a bowl of red punch, this bottling quickly slides into dark, savory herbals, featuring a bit of five-spice blend that evolves as you sniff. On the palate, it's smooth and soothing, with blueberry and other dark blue fruits as well as anise. There is noticeable tannic structure, so this will hold well for a few more years."
Penner-Ash,Riesling,91.5,31.5,2,"Easygoing and juicy, this features classic notes of wild blackberry, pepper and leathery oak that's medium- to full-bodied. Spicy nutmeg and pepper compete for attention on the finish."
People's Wine Revolution,Petite Sirah,88.0,16.5,2,"This overly generous Cabernet Franc is supported by 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Oak, pepper and herb characterize the aromas and flavors, with meatiness competing against notes of cedar. Soft, supple and brawny, the wine finishes in a hurry."
People's Wine Revolution,Syrah,90.0,18.0,1,"Simple and fruity, this has a mix of pineapple, citrus and apple, high-toned and slightly bitter. The toasty component from some sort of barrel/oak treatment is not yet integrated into the fruit. This will need decanting or aging in bottle until 2016."
Pepper Bridge,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.07,61.33,15,"This is an oaky, seemingly sweet, blackberry- and strawberry-tinged blend of 65% Zinfandel, 30% Sangiovese and 5% Syrah. With an earthy note of sage running through, this is a food friendly wine that'll require a hearty meal to tame it down."
Pepper Bridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,60.0,1,"From the cool 2010 vintage, this the blend of 80% Roussanne and 20% Viognier comes across as slender and yeasty, simple and tart."
Pepper Bridge,Merlot,89.0,50.0,1,"Light aromas of mineral, brioche, green apple and spice are followed by sleek but flavorful palate. It shows elegance and detail."
Periple,Chardonnay,89.0,28.0,1,"Coming from a site best known for its Syrah, this wine brings high-toned aromas of violets, herb and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are rich yet supple, with fine-grained but occasionally toothy tannins providing support. Mocha flavors linger on the finish. It's a bit oak heavy but by and large carries it."
Perry Creek,Barbera,89.0,20.0,2,"This tart, sleek, pretty wine shows bright strawberry and raspberry fruit. Quite young and fresh, it's still rather tight and stubbornly closed, even after breathing for a full 24 hours."
Perry Creek,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,26.5,2,"This wine starts out a touch reduced before opening to reveal light aromas of almond, marzipan and spice. The palate puts a premium on elegance, with the concentration at times seeming a bit light but with the balance still there and a lingering finish."
Perry Creek,Chardonnay,90.0,22.0,2,"Malbec (46%) makes up most of this blend followed by 23% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot and finished with Cabernet Franc. It offers aromas of dark plum, currant, cocoa and spice that are followed by generous, textured and full blue and black-fruit flavors that bring a lot of hedonistic appeal. Coffee flavors linger on the finish."
Perry Creek,Petite Sirah,89.0,28.0,1,"Lushly rich on both the nose and the palate, this wine from the heart of the appellation is etched in chocolate and cedar, showing a ying-yang pull between savory and sweet. Currant and dried herb season chalky, firm tannin and toasted oak."
Perry Creek,Viognier,90.0,20.0,1,"Dark notions of hazelnut meet bright, integrated swathes of apple, pear and wild vanilla in this lovely vineyard-designate. Lush on the palate despite its lighter-bodied soul, it's dusted in grapefruit zest and anise, making it complex and delightful."
Perry Creek,Zinfandel,86.5,19.75,4,"This is a well-made wine at a more-than-fair price. Labeled varietally, it also holds smaller additions of other Bordeaux red grapes, most notably 6% Cabernet Franc. Black pepper, leather and cassis surround smoky oak and firm, integrated tannin, making for a complex, full-bodied and balanced experience."
Pessagno,Pinot Noir,91.5,46.5,2,"Big and bold, broad in texture and deep in ripe, chocolaty flavors, this wine is full bodied. Rich in mouthfeel, it's almost sweet, and deftly made to be appealing now despite very firm tannins. It will be outstanding in a pairing with big proteins."
Pestoni Family,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,23.0,1,"Blended with 14% Petite Sirah, this old-vine powerhouse is juicy and sultry, with a hint of smokiness. Leather and bark add to the savory picture, while the tannin profile is decidedly soft and smooth."
Peter Cellars,Merlot,84.5,31.5,2,"The aromas bring a big whack of pungent blue and purple fruit, along with notes of herb and cherry. The flavors are full and palate coating, bringing a real sense of texture and hedonism but still with great freshness."
Peter Cellars,Pinot Noir,84.57,29.57,7,"This site is seeing an increasing number of vineyard-designated bottles made from it. This one brings brooding aromas of dark fruit, licorice and spice that lead to full-bodied, almost jammy fruit flavors. It shows a lot of hedonism but retains its impeccable balance."
Peter Franus,Zinfandel,88.0,38.0,1,"A new addition to the winery's lineup, this wine opens with aromas of underbrush, dark raspberries and red licorice. The palate shows an exquisite sense of restraint and polish along with a lengthy finish that kicks it up a notch. It's a very pretty, thoroughly beguiling wine."
Peter Paul Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,57.5,2,"Though labeled sweet, this has just enough acidity to feel off-dry in the mouth. It brings a mix of pear and peach, apple and orange peel flavors, which fade rather quickly into a flat finish."
Peter Paul Wines,Chardonnay,89.33,41.67,3,"This was the first winery to make a truly white Pinot Noir (back in 2004). Produced exclusively from Pommard clones, it's barrel fermented and aged much like a Chardonnay. Along with great texture and length, there's plenty of acid supporting its palate-pleasing mix of white peach, melon and gooseberry. It finishes with a thread of lightly buttery caramel."
Peter Paul Wines,Pinot Noir,89.12,44.5,8,"Like many of the winery's bottlings, this wine shows rich but balanced concentration. Loamy and fulfilling baked blueberry and blackberry aromas are laced with vanilla. The palate is lavish as well, with strong blueberry syrup, herb and pepper flavors and a caramel touch on the finish."
Peterson,Petit Verdot,90.0,36.0,1,"Spicy clove flavors enwrap rounded tannin and integrated oak in this structured, bold and full-bodied wine. A reserve-tier bottling, it shows deep red fruit, from cassis to currant, and a predominance of both the savory and tart."
Peterson,Zinfandel,89.33,28.0,3,"From a vineyard planted above the town of Sonoma and named for its address, this small-production wine offers blueberry pie, chocolate and smoky oak aromas. Big and burly on the palate with sizable tannins, it integrates black cherry and burnt orange into the mix, finishing balanced and elegant."
Pey-Marin,Pinot Noir,90.0,42.67,3,"From a vineyard site close to the Pacific Ocean, this bombastically rich wine is hard to resist, with its supple rose and lavender notes that grow more powerful on the palate. It leads with fleshy strawberry flavors, augmenting its ripeness with cardamom and chocolate touches."
Pey-Marin,Riesling,90.5,28.5,2,"Waves of purple floral fragrance meld with soy, blackberry and roast lamb on the nose of this complex and compelling bottling. It's quite soft on the palate, with black plum and hoisin sauce flavors accenting its core of dried purple fruit, black pepper and bacon fat. The finish offers a touch of maple syrup."
Pezzi King,Petite Sirah,90.0,38.0,2,"This dark and meaty blend of 58% Syrah and 42% Grenache shows black currant, charred game and black licorice touches. The palate combines pepper-crusted beef flavors with pretty violet and lilac accents, framed by a tannic structure that's robust but not obstructive."
Pezzi King,Zinfandel,86.43,47.43,7,"This blends 52% Chardonnay and 48% Pinot Noir in a seamless, focused package of bright acidity, moderate mousse and tangled peach, tangerine and blood orange flavors. It has impressive complexity and length, with a nutty note that closes out the finish."
Pfendler,Pinot Noir,90.0,45.0,1,"Emmy is 70% Mourvèdre and 30% Syrah blend. The fruit expression is pure and powerful, an intense burst of raspberry and cranberry, anchored in mineral and chalk. Only neutral oak was used, so the fruit is framed beautifully by the acids and tannins, and it is so pure and resonant that it is hard to believe that this wine won't age beautifully for a decade or more."
Phantom Rivers,Merlot,89.0,24.0,1,"This wine has been in release for almost two years, but the extra time has only improved it. Nicely melding the strengths of Klipsun vineyard Cabernet and Merlot with 24 months in half new, half year-old French oak barrels, this powerful wine has concentrated cherry and cassis fruit, potent baking spices, suggestions of mint and pepper, and a host of details waiting to be noticed. A great bottle to toss into a blind tasting of high-end California reds."
Phantom Rivers,Pinot Noir,91.0,28.0,1,"A good amalgam of Red Mountain flavors—hard, tight tannins; dark, smoky black fruits; an underlayer of graphite and mineral. The wine is hard and compact, unyielding, but well-balanced and complete. In the nose are suggestions of moist earth, compost, soy, seaweed; the message is, stay tuned."
Pheasant Valley Winery,Red Blend,82.0,26.0,1,"Creamy and crisp—a nice trick—this refreshing Chardonnay livens up the palate with a mix of herb, celery, apple and Asian pear, rolling into a finish of caramel apple and toast. It has a light touch despite the 14.5% alcohol, and sits nicely in the back of the throat, inviting another glass."
Pheasant Valley Winery,Syrah,85.0,21.0,1,"This pleasant Merlot/Cabernet blend brings ripe cherry fruit flavors that border on raisiny. It's forward, round, soft and fruity, with the Merlot definitely dominating the front, while the Cabernet adds a bit of weight and substance to the finish."
Pheasant Valley Winery,Tempranillo,88.0,28.0,1,"This nonvintage red is a serviceable blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Zinfandel. Sharp, spicy and tannic, it has a bit of a green streak through the finish."
Phelps Creek,Chardonnay,90.17,27.0,6,"Essentially a Cabernet Franc with Merlot and Sangiovese in the blend, this easy-drinking red wine feels a bit generic. One-dimensional berry and pale cherry fruit flavors quickly fade into light tannins."
Phelps Creek,Gewürztraminer,90.0,28.0,1,"The winery produces two outstanding Pinots from estate vineyards planted in 1972. This is big and chewy (as the potent alcohol might suggest) and aging in 50% new French oak puts flavors of toasted coconut and caramel around smooth supple cherry fruit. There's a finishing hint of eucalyptus; all in all, it's a terrific value and a truly original take on Pinot Noir."
Phelps Creek,Merlot,88.0,24.0,1,"Warm butter and light toasted oak scents meld with smoked lemon and walnut hints on the nose of this reserve bottling. The palate is soft and almost sweet upon entry, its cashew and roasted apple flavors buttressed by a grippy tannic texture."
Phelps Creek,Pinot Noir,89.4,38.8,5,"Mulberry, wet rock and sagebrush show on the nose of this single vineyard bottling from a site owned by the Hahn family. The palate is tangy at first, revealing dark red fruit with a smoky kick as it opens, backed by hints of juniper and dust."
Phelps Creek,Red Blend,88.0,42.0,1,"A staple of California winemaking, this vintage is as good as ever—perfectly polished, with light aromas of toasted oak and crisp green apple, lemon-lime and tempting butter flavors, and a medium-bodied frame. The texture is silky smooth, and everything tastes harmonious and balanced."
Phelps Creek,Syrah,88.0,34.0,1,"This is not your parents' crisp and lean Barbera. Ripe, juicy and concentrated, it's so rich and opulent that it seems sweet. From the aromas through the lingeirng finish, it generously doles out raspberry syrup and blackberry jam notes, as well as a chocolaty accent from oak."
Phifer Pavitt,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,80.0,1,"This dense, richly thick wine is full of black pepper and leather flavors that complement its bright layers of black currant, plum and dark cherry fruit. Full bodied and balanced, it offers further complexity as it unwinds in the glass."
Phipps,Zinfandel,87.5,39.0,2,"This bottling from a winery whose owners are originally from Brittany shows peppery spice, tart red fruit, rose petal and lava rock scents on the nose. The flavors range widely from white pepper and dill to fresh-pressed strawberry and red plum, with a slight hint of caramel. Varietally pure and very fresh."
Phoenix Ranch,Cinsault,91.0,21.0,1,"This cofermented field blend is 60% Tannat and 40% Malbec. It's big, black, bold and captivating, with rich blackberry and boysenberry fruit. The tannins are grainy and flecked with graphite, and there's a suggestion of mocha throughout. This might fool some tasters if it were to be tossed into a blind tasting of high-octane Sonoma Zinfandels."
Pianetta,Red Blend,91.5,41.5,4,"This 100% varietal wine is spicy and succulent, with a touch of oak reduction on the nose that resolves as it opens. Big boned, it tastes dark cherry- and plum-driven, spiked with cinnamon and black pepper."
Pianetta,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,38.67,3,"Slightly reduced and showing plenty of barrel imprint, this vineyard designate is bold and grippy, its soft entry marked by clove spice and cigar. The fruit is a combination of plum and dark cherry, subtly wrapped in vanilla toast."
Picayune,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,29.0,1,"Although the challenging vintage resulted in just a half-ton per acre of Chardonnay in this dry appellation (a third of its normal yield), this wine is fantastic. Flinty and smoky aromas lead to Gala apple, white peach and lemon peel on the nose, while the palate combines salt, grapefruit pith and seared apple flavors. A sharp line of acidity brings it all into balance."
Picazo,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,45.0,1,"Cassis and elderberry scents pair perfectly with tobacco and loamy dust aromas in this serious blend of 32% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec. Tobacco accents the black fruit on the palate as well, with dill, anise and charcoal touches. It's firmly structured and bone dry."
Picket Fence,Red Blend,88.0,16.0,1,"This wine wears its high alcohol well, appearing light in the glass and delivering loads of chaparral spice, sandalwood, beet, rhubarb and earthy dust scents on the nose. Although light in body, the palate boasts an underlying juiciness, packed with cranberry, thyme and pencil shaving flavors."
Pietra Santa,Merlot,87.0,18.0,1,"This Petit Verdot grown on the hillsides of El Dorado County in California Gold Country is all dark berry and strawberry jam, still tight and grippy with room to develop added complexity over time."
Pietra Santa,Pinot Noir,87.0,14.0,2,"A blend of Viognier (60%), Roussanne (25%) and Marsanne, this wine is moderately aromatic with notes of pear, melon, apricot and flowers. It's medium bodied with abundant stone fruit flavors, quite reserved considering the warmth of the vintage."
Pietra Santa,Red Blend,85.0,24.0,1,"This blend of Syrah (50%), Petit Verdot (18%) and equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon carries appealing aromas of herbs, cherries, orange peel and sweet barrel spices. It shows a pleasing sense of restraint, accenting the Syrah's suppleness with an elegant styling that keeps the attention high."
Pindar Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,19.0,1,"This is a concentrated, lovely wine that offers a depth of red berry, forest floor and herbes de Provence. All of the wine's elements come together seamlessly on the palate. Approachable now, but should also age well."
Pindar Vineyards,Chardonnay,84.0,9.0,1,"Very seductive and flavorful, this smells like a bushel of ripe blackberries and raspberries, and tastes exotic, generous and full of dark fruit notes. Full bodied and velvety textured, it has enough firm acidity and tannin to make it mouthwatering."
Pindar Vineyards,Red Blend,83.0,11.0,1,"A partnership between winemaker Chris Phelps, who makes the wines for Swanson, and his son, Josh, this Cab is silky in currant, cassis and black raspberry, the oak more sweet than overwhelming. With room to age through 2015–2017, let it open before enjoying."
Pine & Brown,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,60.0,1,"Made by Aaron Pott, this blend of 58% Merlot, 32% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon is minerally and herbaceous, aged almost two years in French oak, half of it new, the rest seasoned. Cassis, pomegranate and peppercorn dance to the fore, supported by weighty tannins. Enjoy through 2020–2022."
Pine & Brown,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,90.0,1,"Richness and ripeness combine with a multilayered and tannic texture that frames the flavors, massages the palate and carries the expressive fruit character through a lingering finish. Ripe blackberries and raspberries accompany a subtle vein of spice and mineral flavors that add complexity."
Pine & Brown,Red Blend,92.0,70.0,1,"Ripe and fruity, rich and generous, almost soft in texture, this starts with strawberry-syrup aromas, then tastes like sweet red cherries with light spicy oak accents. It's basically a big soft pillow of fruitiness, but a touch of tannin kicks in on the finish to keep it refreshing."
Pine Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.4,126.6,5,"Robust in black pepper and intense black fruit, this has a tension of freshness and red cherry, making for a complex and intriguing wine with noticeable structure and a refreshing finish."
Pine Ridge,Chardonnay,89.0,34.0,1,"Tightly wound in oak and smoky forest floor, this intriguing wine walks a tightrope between savory characteristics and power that somewhat over take the fruit."
Pino,Pinot Noir,85.0,20.0,1,"This is made from a majority Cabernet Sauvignon, with 11% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc. This makes for a softly layered tease of cinnamon, cedar and brush, with the tannins dry and grippy. Black licorice and violet dot the nose and palate. Drink now–2020."
Piocho,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,39.0,1,"From an oceanview vineyard west of the Sta. Rita Hills comes this project led by David Yates of Jaffurs Winery. The bottling shows earthy smashed cherry, mulberry, bloody meat and brawny clove notes on the nose. Sagebrush and iron play loudly on the palate, with tart cranberry and herbal nuance. It finishes smooth and clean after a long tang."
Piocho,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,25.0,1,"Enticing plum and baked-strawberry aromas invite the nose on this bottling, as do sandalwood, cola and nutmeg notes. The palate begins with soft cranberry and then dives into oregano and thyme before moving into more restrained gravel flavors, finishing with juniper and pine needles. This wine's wound-up structure will unfurl nicely with time."
Piro,Pinot Noir,93.67,40.0,3,"A depth of baking spices and cinnamon stick greets the nose and palate with eager abundance, showing off the wine's savory, flirty side. Good acidity helps balance out the powerful concentration and sword's edge of alcohol, before finishing fresh and with length."
Pirouette,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,95.0,70.0,2,"Rich, soft and luscious, this bottling shows ripe black cherry, caramel, crème brûlée and a tinge of herbs on the nose. It's creamy, dense and smoky once sipped, with baked plum and blackberry-pie flavors laced with vanilla and caramel, proving undeniably delicious and certain to please many palates."
Pirouette,Red Blend,92.0,55.0,1,"One of the first releases since Charles Banks invested in Bob Lindquist's pioneering brand, this wine shows Japanese apple, lemon blossoms, lightly browned butter and a touch of tropicality on the nose. Still a bit wound up, the wine conveys potential length, with green-apple skins, nectarine flesh, cement-like minerality and a chive herb lift."
Pittsburgh,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,55.0,1,"A light, bright and lemony white wine that's textured and deliciously quaffable, this vineyard-designate is only available in tiny amounts and well worth the hunt. Orange blossom and juicy peach figure on the nose and palate without the interference of oak or undue sweetness."
Piña,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.58,86.5,12,"Featuring a unique and intriguingly fresh and floral nose, this shows bright strawberry, fresh-pressed hibiscus flowers, exotic vanilla-cinnamon notes and hints of slate and chaparral. The palate is just a hair less exciting, with raspberry, cranberry, white pepper, white sage and dried mint, all wrapped with tart acidity and tannins."
Piña,Chardonnay,87.0,34.0,3,"A truly complex and layered style from deep in SoCal, this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah brings aromas of smoked chocolate, smashed strawberries, dried rose petals and oregano. The palate bursts with red cherry and blackberry fruit, then settles into smoked meats and dried dill."
Plaisance Ranch,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,25.0,1,"A classic profile for top-shelf California Syrah, this bottling shows blackberry, black pepper, thyme, charred pork and dense purple flowers on the nose. The palate melds dried herbs with dense fruit, offering fennel pollen, oregano, marjoram and black cardamom atop blueberry and olallieberry, with a touch of dark chocolate toward the finish."
Plaisance Ranch,Carmenère,89.0,30.0,2,"This dry and sophisticated wine made from 77% Pinot Noir and 23% Chardonnay has just what's needed in a rosé. It has a vivid light-copper color, an aroma like red cherries and apple skin, and flavors that are bright and fresh. The balance is almost austere but rounds after a couple of sips."
Plaisance Ranch,Chardonnay,87.0,25.0,3,"This elegant, dry bubbly has a light-gold color, aromas like peach skin and white cherries, and flavors that are crisp, fruity and vivid. It starts out reserved before opening up to riper, richer tones, partly due to 15% reserve wine in the blend. Not just for toasting, it will make a very good match with seafood."
Plaisance Ranch,Mondeuse,87.0,30.0,1,"This especially firm and well-structured wine was aged longer than usual in mostly new French barrels. It tastes great now but should improve through 2020. Cranberry and black-tea aromas give way to bold cherry and pomegranate flavors, and a layered texture of fine-grained tannins and good acidity."
Plaisance Ranch,Pinot Noir,87.67,28.33,3,"Brown-pink in color, like a burnt rosé, this wine conveys strong caramel aromas reminiscent of brandy, cognac and bourbon. The palate is thick and treacly with strong flavors of wood and cherry-laced caramel, with a raisiny finish."
Plaisance Ranch,Red Blend,85.67,25.0,3,"This wine offers more power and heat on the palate than would be expected given the listed alcohol by volume, a hammering of huge tannins holding the fruit hostage. An unpleasant fish-sauce aroma mars the nose."
Plaisance Ranch,Syrah,89.5,26.25,4,"Blended with 10% Petite Sirah, this wine has a stewed quality that makes it seem overdone, with only the slightest suggestion of fruit and spice."
Plaisance Ranch,Tempranillo,88.33,25.0,3,"This lean wine has light melon and dried herb aromas, an almost neutral flavor profile and short finish."
Plumb Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.33,37.33,3,"This is a light, nondescript white wine, with a trace of sweetness on the finish."
Plumb Cellars,Red Blend,89.5,18.0,2,"Promising aromas of tangerine, light honey and plumeria flowers make a good introduction to this rare look at Chenin Blanc in Paso Robles. The flavors fall a bit flat, though, proving very round with a just a hint of chopped herbs."
Plumb Cellars,Sangiovese,88.0,34.0,1,"Light Marcona almonds, lemon curd on toast and Gravenstein apples converge for a delicate yet warmer style of Chard on this easy-to-quaff combo of seven top vineyards, including Bentrock, Rita's Crown, Clos Peper, Kessler-Haak, La Rinconada, Zotovich, and Hilliard Bruce. Buttered brioche, a drizzle of lemon oil and a touch of crushed walnuts and almonds arise on the palate."
Plumb Cellars,Syrah,89.0,26.0,1,"Neil Collins goes for the classic five Rhône grapes in this bottling, blending 48% Mourvèdre, 21% Syrah, 11% Grenache, 11% Cinsault and 9% Counoise to elicit aromas of dried fennel, fresh lavender, white pepper and boysenberry jam. Tight but juicy blueberry and elderberry fruit show on the palate, bound together by upright tannins and lifted with asphalt, black peppercorns and potpourri spice."
Plumb Cellars,Viognier,83.0,22.0,1,"A remarkably good wine at this price. Lemon meringue and custard meet creamy stone fruit in a balanced, decadent way, a suggestion of orange whip tugging at the edges of the palate. It glides down easy, impressing further with every sip, remaining balanced and graceful."
Plungerhead,Zinfandel,87.2,14.0,5,"Peppery herbal notes populate the nose, leading into flavors of brambly red fruits. The wine gathers strength on the midpalate, finishing with a flourish of strawberry preserves. There's a touch of rhubarb pie and a dusting of cocoa in the mix as well, and for an Oregon Pinot Noir made in such quantities (more than 10,000 cases) it offers exceptional depth and density."
Plush,Pinot Noir,86.0,50.0,1,"This is a barrel selection, and as such, may be expected to show extra layers of concentration—more stuffing overall. It's a rich, smoky, lush wine, with a complex mix of red fruits ranging from rhubarb to raspberry to Bing cherries. Spicy highlights and a frame of orange peel also enter the picture. You might wish to give this another couple of years of bottle age before popping the cork. Drink 2018–2025."
Plush,Red Blend,81.0,8.0,1,"This estate-grown wine comes from the vineyard that provides the backbone to the producer's well-known Les Pommiers Pinot Noir. Tart in rhubarb, pomegranate and plush, herb-kissed red fruit, it's juicy and young, complex yet approachable. Full bodied and grainy in tannin, it'll provide years of pleasure for drinkers who can wait."
Poet's Leap,Riesling,95.0,85.0,1,"The Estates Reserve is a barrel selection combining chosen lots from the three estate vineyards. Despite this vintage's reputation for offering ripe, forward, accessible flavors, this wine remains stubbornly closed. It's entirely possible that it has just hit a bit of a dumb phase, which is not uncommon for recently-bottled Pinot Noir. Ripe full-bodied flavors of strawberry preserves peek through, with moderating acids and no herbal notes."
Poggi Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,75.0,1,"The wine from this vineyard has a lightly smoky scent, more of the characteristic tobacco aromas, and a flavorful fruit mix of mulberry, blueberry and blackberry. It's spicy and chunky and generous, ready for near-term drinking."
Point & Line,Chardonnay,90.0,40.0,1,"This captivating wine, from vines dating back to the early 1970s, will reward your patience. It must be decanted if you want it to burst open past the initial tart flavors of green apple and grapefruit. Once it does, it will delight with juicy citrus, ample acidity, and plenty of grip."
Point & Line,Pinot Noir,92.5,47.25,4,"This vineyard dates to the Civil War era and is owned by Joel and Morgan Peterson, Joel of Ravenswood fame. Funky and selectively spicy, it shows its dry-farmed heritage with dusty tannin and stemmy earth, the density mellowed by piquant red fruit."
Point & Line,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,25.0,1,"Made from a single vineyard, this wine is both tasty and complex enough to stimulate the imagination. It smells like butter and cream, and tastes like ripe pear, toasted almonds and vanilla bean. Luscious yet a bit crisp, the texture feels great on the palate. Grenache Blanc, Piquepoul Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier all contributed."
Pomar Junction,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.5,44.0,2,"Tart and juicy, with wild raspberry fruit streaked with dried herb and just hinting at black cherry. This is a subtle yet powerful wine, with whiffs of smoke, licorice and coffee, but far less noticeable barrel influence than its companion reds. Focused and pure, with the structure to age."
Pomar Junction,G-S-M,89.0,45.0,1,"A real success, this 100% Merlot, sourced from the Stillwater Creek and Conner Lee vineyards, is exotically scented with a rich mix of baking spices, coffee, dust, pencil lead and cedar. Lots of oak influence, but it plays well against the tart and mellow berry flavors. There is a suggestion of dried leaf, perhaps an indication of older vines."
Pomar Junction,Grenache Blanc,88.0,25.0,1,"Intense concentration and firm structure make this an age-worthy, big and tannic wine. It boasts a deep, dark color, dense ripe blackberry and black cherry aromas and spicy, oaky nuances that add complexity. Best after 2019."
Pomar Junction,Viognier,88.0,25.0,1,"Light, quiet layers of spice persist in this elegant, soft yet refined wine. Rose petal, orange, cherry and rhubarb flavors provide subtle fruitiness, supported by vibrant acidity and unobtrusive oak."
Pomum,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,38.0,1,"Ripe, dark fruit flavors get great support from spicy oak and firm tannins in this full-bodied wine from an outstanding producer. Cinnamon and clove notes drive the aroma, while blackberry and black cherry flavors fill out the palate."
Pomum,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,40.0,2,"This pretty Pinot offers ripe fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry. There's a nice dash of chocolate and a supple, seamless mouthfeel, with all the components beautifully integrated."
Pomum,Graciano,92.0,32.0,1,"A block selection from the producer's expertly farmed estate in Carneros, this is a robust, ripe white that's velvety rich on the palate and laced with apple and melon flavors. A tart, salty note laps at its edges."
Pomum,Red Blend,85.0,34.0,1,"Three-fifths was whole-cluster fermented, and the wine spent 18 months in 20% new French oak. This bottling amplifies the house style, which favors ripe, concentrated flavors of strawberry and raspberry fruit, adding highlights of chocolate and espresso. A whiff of dried straw wraps this up."
Pomum,Riesling,88.33,16.0,3,"This is a fruity mix of sweet berries, with a streak of ripe orange. In both nose and mouth an almost delicate earthiness can be noticed, with suggestions of dried leaves."
Pomum,Tempranillo,88.0,35.0,1,"Made from 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Malbec and 4% Petit Verdot and aged in 100% new oak for 20 months, this is a burly red wine with impressive structure and presence. Tangy red fruit, recalling cranberry and currant, is spiced with clove, mountain sage, bay leaf and molasses notes."
Pondera,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.73,36.09,11,"Concentrated cola, dark cherry, tree bark and wet-gravel aromas make for a very focused and intense nose in this bottling. The palate is hearty and full of blackberry and black plum fruit, with more complex char and tar flavors. Quite layered and compelling."
Pondera,Cabernet Franc,89.0,32.0,1,"This is a luscious wine with a smooth and hearty mouthfeel, ample ripe fruit reminiscent of pears and white peaches, and vanilla and honey accents on both the nose and palate. Fermented in neutral barrels, it doesn't have oaky flavors but feels soft in acidity and seems to melt in the mouth."
Pondera,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,36.0,1,"From old-vine blocks planted in 1934, this vineyard-designate also contains 4% Carignane. Full bodied and richly concentrated, it has pillowy tannins, and aromas and flavors defined by mint, dill, black licorice and leather. Layers of deep, dark blackberry and black cherry give it a pleasing fruitiness as well."
Pondera,Malbec,90.0,34.0,2,"The variety is unmistakable, with notes of dried herb, dark cherry and espresso. The jammy fruit flavors are rich, with lightly grainy tannins and coffee notes on the finish. It shows a fine sense of balance."
Pondera,Red Blend,88.5,30.25,4,"Just one barrel was produced from the own-rooted vines planted almost 50 years ago. It's earthy and scented with a menthol/eucalyptus note, that carries on through. Cranberry flavor reflects the rather low alcohol, but there is no hint of unripeness or any vegetative character."
Pondera,Syrah,90.0,38.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (66%), Cabernet Sauvignon (20%) and Syrah. The aromas are brooding, with notes of earth, toast, red fruit and spice. The palate brings tart tangy cranberry flavors that linger on the finish."
Ponte,Rosé,86.0,28.0,1,It's rare to see a vineyard-designated bottle of Pinot Gris from the state. This one brings light aromas of apple and pear that are followed by dry fleshy fruit flavors. It hits all the right notes.
Pontin del Roza,Riesling,87.0,8.0,1,"This is a well-made blend of 53% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc, 6% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. It is among the producer's “curious blends,” created from estate properties in different styles. Here, firm, structured and present tannins dominate an otherwise concentrated and spicy mix of black licorice, clove and tobacco."
Ponzi,Chardonnay,92.71,50.79,14,"This expansive wine is generous on the palate in dusty tannin, currant, pencil and tobacco, more savory than sweet. Firm texture and structured acidity provide a classic edge to this 100% varietal wine that will do well at the table."
Ponzi,Pinot Gris,93.0,38.0,1,Aromas of pear and yellow apple are at the fore. It drinks off dry with full feel. There's enjoyment to be had but the varietal is hard to discern.
Ponzi,Pinot Noir,92.73,70.91,22,"A rustic, barnyard aroma greets one on the nose before a basic taste of stewed prunes waltzes in."
Ponzi,Rosé,88.67,20.83,6,"A burnt, reduced quality mars the fruit in this wine, made in a big style with full-bodied power and density."
Pope Valley Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.5,52.0,2,"Barrel notes take the lead with aromas of char, butterscotch and spice overrunning the fruit. There's a pleasing creamy feel to the sweet fruit flavors but the variety is near impossible to find."
Pope Valley Winery,Merlot,87.0,32.0,1,"Earth, mint and blackberry flavors make this full-bodied and firmly-tannic wine both flavorful and eccentric. As the wine sits in the glass for several minutes the aroma become like beef bouillon and the texture on the palate is a bit astringent."
Pope Valley Winery,Red Blend,83.0,32.0,1,"This wine is flawed, with rustic leathery undertones that veer into Band-Aid, and an intensely sour note. Multiple bottles tried over several months."
Pope Valley Winery,Sangiovese,83.0,28.0,1,"Like a pastry shop in a glass, this rare treat of a well-aged bubbly smells of cream, butter and nutmeg, and tastes like baked apples, almonds and vanilla. Although not sweet, its generous fruit, spice and nut nuances build on the crisp but smooth texture and linger on the finish. From a cool vintage that produced long-lived wines, this is irresistible now but should keep through 2020."
Portalupi,Barbera,89.75,43.25,4,"One of just a handful of varietal bottlings made in the state, this wine offers aromas of white pepper, fresh vegetables and flowers. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors."
Portalupi,Pinot Noir,89.33,56.67,3,"This is a late release wine, but a bit of a boon for wine drinkers, who may open and consume it at will. Light cranberry, licorice, root beer and coffee flavors meld, with plenty of supporting acidity. It's a modest wine, with a quick finish, but drinks nicely at the moment."
Portalupi,Vermentino,87.0,28.0,4,"Barrel aromas are out front, with notes of char, toast and vanilla along with dark raspberry and spice. The palate presents a mixture of fruit and barrel, with the latter showing a bit too prominently."
Portalupi,Zinfandel,90.67,43.33,3,"Aromas of green wood, vanilla and cola are followed by plump fruit flavors. The palate brings appeal but the aromas don't seem to match up."
Portfolio,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,96.0,155.0,1,"Rounded aromas of baked strawberry, red plum and a touch of graphite show on the nose of this always-solid offering for everyday sipping. Black raspberry and dried sagebrush make for a compelling palate that finishes on a touch of caramel."
Portfolio,Red Blend,95.0,140.0,1,"A deep, dense blackberry flavor suggests that this is cellar worthy. Notes of ground coffee, cacao and clean earth abound. The finish is long and compact, with nicely polished tannins."
Portlandia,Pinot Noir,90.0,40.0,2,"This blend consists of 40% Mourvèdre, 40% Grenache and 20% Syrah, creating a strong base that's loaded with steely mineral and graphite notes, plus tart fruit flavors of cranberry and strawberry. A hint of strawberry leaf brings in an herbal accent."
Portlandia,Rosé,88.0,18.0,1,"Consulting winemaker Matthew Loso knows his way around a blend, and this fine Cabernet-Merlot mix shines with focused, dark fruit flavors. It's threaded with streaks of clove, black olive and anise, with real muscle and tannic heft."
Portola Vineyards,Chardonnay,90.0,30.0,1,"In this vintage, the blend is 66% Tempranillo and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon. The earthy funk is well integrated with black cherry and hints of stem and bark. Still tight and herbal, this is a well-balanced, well-crafted wine, with medium body and length."
Portola Vineyards,Pinot Noir,87.5,38.0,2,"This opens with a powerful, sharp and spicy set of aromas mixing dense blackberry and boysenberry fruit with sweet smoke and chocolate-covered raisins. This is a fine effort, with sappy fruit, tart acids, streaks of leaf and vanilla, a burst of tobacco in the mid-palate, and a smooth finish with polish and verve."
Poseidon,Chardonnay,90.17,42.0,6,"Opulence is the winery's reserve Syrah, and it is a robust, tooth-staining wine that takes no prisoners. Dense scents suggest a pig roast on a pile of licorice sticks; the aromas are almost visceral. The fruit has been very well handled and the tannins, though full and powerful, have been polished to a satiny sheen. There's a little chalkiness to the finish, perhaps from acidification, but that may well resolve with a little more bottle age."
Poseidon,Pinot Noir,90.86,41.86,7,"Sage-tinted cedar and black cherry combine in this proprietary blend of 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Sangiovese, 13% Syrah and 13% Zinfandel, from the producer's estate vineyard. Lean and refined, it shares a generosity of chocolate on the palate, with a slight spiciness to the finish."
Potek,Pinot Noir,92.5,55.0,2,"Beef teriyaki, lavender, lilacs, black pepper, smoked meat and blueberry jam combine for a dynamic nose. The palate is also very much the full Syrah package: black pepper dust, blackberry fruit, soy, charcoal, teriyaki-plum sauce, contained by both strong tannic structure and zesty acidity."
Potek,Riesling,89.0,35.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Merlot (63%), a whopping 22% Petit Verdot and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of smoke, cedar, dried herbs, licorice, pencil lead, crushed flowers and red and black berries are followed by soft, plump fruit flavors. It brings an undeniable warm vintage appeal but with a compelling sense of elegance and balance."
Potek,Syrah,91.0,45.0,1,"This wine hails from a new vineyard region high above famed Seven Hills. Baking spice, cocoa and herb aromas are followed by focused black-fruit flavors, with espresso and vanilla notes that linger. It captures the attention."
Potter's Vineyard,Pinot Noir,88.0,25.0,1,"A partnership between Julia Jackson of Jackson Family Wines and Hélène Seillan, whose mentor is her father, Pierre Seillan of Vérité, this wine is lithe and complex, made from 100% Cabernet Franc, and shows plum and tangerine atop layered, pronounced acidity and a depth of weight that belies its lightness of being."
Powers,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,30.0,1,"Simultaneously light, vivacious and flavor-packed, this bottling is a lightly faded shade of pink in the glass, and shows delicate bubble gum, sliced watermelon, pink rose buds and a squeeze of lime on the nose. The blend of 45% Grenache, 30% Mourvèdre and 25% Syrah offers zesty acidity and a pithy texture on the palate, with bright tangerine, lemon pith and a touch of strawberry fruit."
Powers,Syrah,89.0,25.0,1,"Very tight and Chablis-like in style, this bottling from Richard and Thekla Sanford shows crisp Asian pear, lemon pith, Pink Lady apple rinds, wet concrete and a touch of petrol on the nose. The palate is light and fresh, with yellow pear, nectarine and a lemon skin-led acidity, possessing all the bones to age with style."
Prager,Port,87.8,68.4,5,"A plush style of the grape, this shows blackberry and black plum fruit, lush purple flowers, baking spice and a dusting of graphite on the nose. The palate is soft and cola-driven, with blackberry puree, woody elderberry and violet flavors. The tannic structure enhance its robust character."
PreVail,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,90.0,1,"Blended with 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Malbec, this sturdily built, medium-bodied wine shows a distinct green, herbal quality that's strong and persistent on the nose. Pencil shaving and sage elements contribute further intrigue and complexity."
Predator,Zinfandel,83.0,15.0,2,This unoaked Chardonnay is powered by tangy lemon and pineapple flavors. It's medium-bodied and has nice concentration without seeming overly ripe. Butter and vanilla touches weave through its lively fresh fruit notes.
Prejean,Chardonnay,82.0,13.0,1,"This wine is a pretty very pale peach, almost bronze color. Light strawberry aromas are followed by bone-dry textured fruit flavors. Pink grapefruit lingers on the finish. Pair it with food to see it at its best."
Presqu'ile,Pinot Noir,92.11,44.22,9,"Grippy with tar notes and tannin, this full-bodied wine offers ripe blackberry, currant and licorice highlights before giving in to its richness with dark chocolate renderings."
Presqu'ile,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,22.0,1,"Juicy plum and currant flavors accent the velvety texture of this soft, integrated estate wine. It displays a light sprinkling of black pepper and clove."
Presqu'ile,Sparkling Blend,91.67,64.67,3,"Doug Margerum delivers his annual crowd-pleaser with this bottling, which evokes ripe apple, sweet stone fruit and grapefruit pith on the nose. Chalky texture and racy acidity mark the palate, providing the perfect framework for sour kumquat flavors and a cement-like minerality."
Pressed,Pinot Noir,92.0,40.0,1,"Consistently among the best $20-and-under wines each vintage, this blend of 52% Grenache, 44% Syrah and 4% Tempranillo from vintner Dan Lee delivers plump boysenberry, plum, baking spice and rosemary scents on the nose. The palate is dry and herbal yet bright with acidity, full of thyme and sagebrush notes against a backdrop of plum fruit."
Preston,Merlot,85.0,14.0,1,"This Pinot Noir-dominant sparkler is nutty and perfumed, its honeysuckle scents bringing lightness and brightness to a meaty core of body and weight."
Preston,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,36.0,1,"Sweet tannins support this wine's cassis and cherry flavors, accented with sage and dried herb. With a dry, puckering mouthfeel, it's boldly ripe and brawny, showing persistent toasty oak scents."
Preston,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,14.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Carménère, Merlot and Petit Verdot, coming from a block designed by the late Master of Wine David Lake. Light aromas of herb, green pepper and cherry are followed by elegant fruit flavors that seem a bit faint. The oak appears to be dialed way back. Best paired with food."
Preston,Syrah-Petite Sirah,87.0,36.0,1,"This is an intriguing wine, with the extraction and the alcohol seemingly dialed back. Somewhat light in color, it brings aromas of fresh herb, sweet spice, cedar and cherry. The flavors are elegant and cranberry tart. It doesn't come off as entirely varietal but there's plenty of enjoyment to be had, especially if paired with food."
Pride Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,113.33,6,"This blend of Merlot (61%), Cabernet Sauvignon (27%), Syrah (8%) and Petit Verdot brings notes of anise, black currant, herbs, mint and raspberries. The palate brings good depth of flavors and richness while showing both elegance and precision."
Pride Mountain,Chardonnay,89.0,50.5,4,"The distinct black and white pepper nose on this wine by Siduri's Adam Lee evolves into gingerbread and cinnamon, all backed up by riper scents of blackberry extract. It's light in density, but pops with black cherry and more berry flavors, all carrying a citrus-like tannic grip."
Pride Mountain,Claret,90.33,136.67,3,"From the Hahn family of wines comes this solid representation of the appellation, with dark cherry, wet slate and soft mint on the nose. The mouthfeel is soft and comforting, with tight raspberry fruit and a clove-like spice note carrying through the entire sip, culminating in a mouthwatering black-pepper finish."
Pride Mountain,Merlot,93.0,80.0,1,"This concentrated Merlot is blended with smaller percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Syrah. Dense in black licorice and toasty oak, the fruit character is dominated by red plum and berry aromas and flavors."
Priest Ranch,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,80.0,1,"Coming from the highest corner of the limestone-laden vineyard at 1,275 feet—with views of the entire Santa Ynez Valley—this gives off broad, approachable aromas of lit match, bacon fat, purple fruits, pepper and smoked meats. Though full of dried cherry and smoked blueberry flavors, it's leaner in texture, with acidity that keeps it fresh. Drink 2017–2025."
Priest Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,48.0,1,"This wine is 79% Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. It offers brooding notes of dried herbs, cassis, spicebox, blackberry and anise. Flavors are rich yet refined with mouthwatering acids and exquisitely polished tannins."
Priest Ranch,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,22.0,1,"An inspired co-mingling of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, this wine offers swirls of spicy cinnamon, plum and tobacco. Rounded on the palate and balanced, while rich, the finish delves into clove and black pepper."
Prim Family,Pinot Noir,92.0,30.0,2,"This is the inaugural release from this winery. With Grenache (71%) and Syrah (23%) leading the way, it shows aromas of vanilla bean, herb and ripe red and blue fruit. The palate is full bodied and no holds barred, showing a mixture of fruit and barrel along with the ripeness of the region and vintage. The wood pokes through at times."
Primarius,Pinot Noir,89.0,22.0,1,"A savory, woody accent runs through this medium-bodied, earthy and attractive wine made from “America's oldest Zinfandel vineyard.” The mouthfeel is quite smooth, with ample blackberry and strawberry flavors that soak the palate."
Prime Solum,Cabernet Franc,92.0,79.0,1,"Coming from a blend of fruit from the Walla Walla Valley, Red Mountain and Yakima Valley appellations, this wine opens with high-toned aromas of spice box, dark cherry, earth, tobacco and herb. The flavors are full and tightly coiled, with lightly grained tannins giving support. At times it seems a bit dried out."
Prime Solum,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.5,79.5,4,"A blend of fruit from DuBrul and Meek vineyards, this wine brings light aromas of herb, vanilla, raspberry, orange peel and black licorice. The palate offers a mouthful of tart fruit flavors that are simultaneously sleek and generous."
Prodigal,Pinot Noir,91.0,45.0,1,"Beguiling aromas of honeysuckle, lime, peach and baking spices are followed by palate-coating stone-fruit flavors. It shows an impeccable sense of balance."
Proper,Syrah,92.25,46.5,4,"This wine blends 49% Syrah with 27% Mourvèdre, 18% Grenache and 6% Counoise. Together, they provide a smooth, seductive taste of strawberry pie that invites and delights within a full-bodied package that's enjoyable now."
Prophecy,Red Blend,90.0,14.0,1,"This blend of 35% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Petite Sirah is actually a party of three, but the results are solid. Chocolate, black cherries, scarlet rose buds and toasted oak pop on the nose. The smooth and dense palate shows boysenberry, black pepper and a chalky tannic structure."
Prospect 772,G-S-M,89.0,36.0,2,"Somewhat lean in texture but very tasty and classic in terms of aroma and flavor, this wine has a unique presence. Aromas suggest rhubarb, raspberry and black tea, and the flavors reflect that complexity, too. At less than half the price of Hirsch's higher-priced wines, it has almost as much charm."
Prospect 772,Grenache,91.0,36.0,1,"Coming from one of the state's top Cabernet sites, this wine offers reserved aromas of earth, dried leaves and herb, cocoa and dusty cherry. The palate shows precision and balance, with a focus on elegance of expression."
Prospect 772,Grenache Blanc,88.67,27.0,3,"This estate wine comes from vines planted two decades ago and was named for John Drummond, who owned the land in the 1800s. With a touch of Cabernet Franc in the mix, it offers black licorice, buoyant acidity and a back beat of tannin that integrates well. Bark, dark plum and chocolate round out the full-bodied picture."
Prospect 772,Grenache-Syrah,92.0,36.0,3,"This wine comes from vineyards planted in the late 1970s. It shows pleasing aromas of Bosc pear, melon and flowers. The wine tastes a hair off dry, with a full, appealing feel to the apple and passion fruit flavors."
Prospect 772,Red Blend,90.5,27.0,2,"A pretty peachy color, this bottling, which is 100% Mourvèdre, shows an intriguingly salty strawberry hint to the nose, where dried cherries and brisk watermelon aromas also pop. There is zesty acidity to the sip with richness in the midpalate, offering flavors of sea-salted peaches, orange-rind tang and impressive length for a rosé."
Prospect 772,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.25,36.0,4,"Sizable tannins and oak make for a full-bodied experience that comes off closed and tight at first, the wine needing some time in the glass to unwind. With patience, it unpeels layers of soft, floral aromas and quiet notions of raspberry and strawberry."
Prospect 772,Syrah,91.6,36.6,5,"From the famous vineyard site along Westside Road, equally known for its Chardonnay, this big, bold red is not for the faint of heart. It delivers a powerful punch of voluptuously jammy blueberry around soft, earthy wisps of forest and black tea."
Prospect 772,Syrah-Petite Sirah,94.0,36.0,1,"Second-generation winemaker Drake Whitecraft taps his friend Matt's vineyard for this fruit-forward bottling, which shows smashed black grapes, black cherry, black raspberry, lavender, lilac and cola on the nose. The palate is juicy with blueberry and blackberry, lifted by violet and lavender, and touched with white pepper spice."
Prospect 772,Syrah-Viognier,92.5,36.0,2,"This delicious bottle sings out with a burst of bright raspberry fruit. As with all the Winderlea designates, the exposure to new oak is fairly minimal—just 10 months in one-sixth new barrels. Juicy acidity keeps flavors buoyant, and the barrels add light notes of caramel and nougat. Drink this with great enjoyment over the next two or three years."
Proteus,Pinot Noir,93.0,28.0,1,"In honor of Adam Comartin's daughter, who's named after the Australian city where he learned a bit of winemaking, this bubblegum pink wine offers plush and inviting aromas of light strawberry, peach skins and watermelon juice. Rounded pink and red fruits show on the palate, cut by orange zest, packed up with edgy acid and grippy tension. Quite complex."
Proulx,Grenache,88.0,24.67,3,"From a warm site on the valley floor, this wine is soft and velvety, approachable and sophisticated. An additional 8% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot provide complexity and further softness, the wine buoyant in juicy blueberry, currant and fig."
Proulx,Mission,88.0,16.8,5,"This is the producer's proprietary Merlot-driven blend, the variety comprising 60% of the whole, with 30% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. Like its other blends, it spent 21 months in French oak, 75% of it new. Sanguine in currant and plum, its thick structure holds richer notes of chocolate and coconut. Drink now through 2023."
Proulx,Red Blend,89.6,60.4,5,"Estate grown and fermented with native yeasts, the Select cuvée is the entry level offering from Brick House. In this hot vintage the picking, sorting and fermentation have been carefully managed to produce a balanced and textural wine. The fruit shines through with apple, cranberry and cherry, underscored by a refreshing minerality. The acids have a subtle citrus/orange peel flavor."
Proulx,Rosé,87.0,35.0,4,"This lush wine, green/gold in hue, offers mouth-coating flavors with richness and style. Apple, pear and papaya fruit holds down the center, with elements of toasted hazelnuts and butter pecan from aging in 20% new French oak. The creamy, smooth finish is delightful."
Proulx,Syrah,88.0,72.0,1,"A depth of earth and sassafras make for sultry companions in this vineyard designate, marked by heady aromas of roses. Soft and subtle on the palate, with a lightness and elegance, it lingers in pomegranate, raspberry and black tea."
Proulx,Zinfandel,88.0,40.0,1,"Quite distinct from the winery's regular Pinot Gris, this is oak fermented and barrel aged on the lees for 16 months. The hock bottle suggests an Alsatian model, the extended barrel time softening the sharp acidity. There's a light suggestion of wood flavor, not toast but neutral wood, and the fruit is damped down. However, with extra aeration this wine springs to life, with complex highlights of wood, herb and stone."
Provenance Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,50.0,1,"Medium-light, with clean and fresh berry fruit flavors, sharp and tart. It starts out with some quick punch, then fades away in a fast finish."
Provenance Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.83,107.0,6,"This Bordeaux-style blend, one of four from this tiny winery, is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon. The somewhat thin cranberry and raspberry fruit, high in acid, is not quite substantial enough to completely shed its candied character."
Provenance Vineyards,Sauvignon Blanc,86.5,29.0,2,"A white Bordeaux-style blend, crisp and edgy, with green fruit flavors sporting a citrusy kick. Young, tight and tart, it shows its alcohol on the angular finish."
Provincial Vineyards,Pinot Gris,90.0,16.0,1,"A new vineyard source for the producer, this was planted in 1910 to a mix of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Peloursin and Trousseau. The wine shows a zestiness to the palate and fruit, a mix of pomegranate, raspberry and plum, side-kicked by dusty mocha. Bright in acidity with a chalky finish, the wine can be enjoyed now with a decant or cellared through 2022."
Provincial Vineyards,Pinot Noir,88.5,34.5,2,"Coming from Uvas Valley earth that was originally planted in the 1920s by Italian immigrants, this wine shows leather, plum sauce and dark chocolate on the nose. It's light on the palate, but possesses strong tannic grip and refreshing acidity that boost the dried flower, blueberry juice and graphite flavors."

Puccioni,Zinfandel,89.0,30.0,2,"This 100% varietal comes from StoneTree and Red Heaven vineyards. Fruit-forward, it suggests blueberry pie with barrel notes of pencil lead and vanilla. It's full bodied and supple in feel with abundant blue-fruit flavors and smoked-meat accents on the warm, lingering finish."
Pulchella,Grenache-Syrah,91.0,70.0,1,"Zin fans should pick up this winery's entire range of small-batch takes on the grape, as they are all fascinating. This one is lighter in color and offers fresh blackberry and chopped black-sage aromas. The palate is very easy to sip, with salt and cherry flavors creating a food-friendly version of an often overpowering grape."
Pulchella,Pinot Noir,89.0,35.0,2,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-centric blend includes all six Bordeaux varieties. It has sweet, ripe notes of fresh dark cherries, herbs and chocolate drizzled with butter backed by slightly dry tannins."
Pulchella,Red Blend,92.33,40.67,3,"Coming from one of Washington's premier Riesling sites, it's redolent with peach, mineral and floral notes. It drinks almost completely dry with bright, crisp acids."
Pulchella,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.5,47.5,2,"Pedro Vargas has made a nice Merlot in this strongly herbal, plum and cassis concoction inviting in its layers of oak and tobacco. Soft, it finishes lean and is all in all integrated and well-made."
Pulchella,Syrah,91.0,64.0,1,"A single-vineyard Pinot Gris, focused and tart, with flavors as fresh as can be. Sharp and yeasty, but with good grip and substance through the middle, and a flash of heat in the finish. This will benefit from another year or so of bottle age."
Pulchella,Tannat,89.0,40.0,2,"There are some elegant floral highlights in the nose, leading into a fairly substantial mouthful of mixed citrus, apricot and peach fruit. Bigger than most Oregon Pinot Blancs, this has a round, fruity flavor with a hint of sweetness."
Pulchella,Tannat-Syrah,93.0,40.0,1,"This impressive wine is tangy in cherry, cranberry and evocative peels of orange zest that possess concentrated tannin and weight while maintaining a baseline of positive acidity. Lengthy and bold on the finish, it lingers in hits of spice."
Pulchella,Tempranillo,88.0,35.0,1,"This white is barrel fermented and then aged further sur lie in a mix of French oak, stainless steel and concrete egg, with the goal of additional texture and complexity coming into play. It does, the wine intoxicating in floral apple blossom and honeysuckle, with a taste of crisp, refreshing lemon and grapefruit. Light bodied, it doesn't hold back on mouthfeel, offering richness without overripeness."
Pulchella,Zinfandel,94.0,50.0,1,"This concentrated, full-bodied wine blends 80% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, all grown from the producer's Upper Bench blocks known for cobbly soils. Brick, tar and pencil shavings accent a considerable presence of tannin and toasty oak. It should show best from 2020 to 2022."
Pull,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,18.0,1,"This is an approachable, varietal wine, representative of the appellation in its dusty black cherry and vanilla. Succulently juicy on the palate, it offers more satisfyingly savory accents of leather and black pepper in a full-bodied, concentrated package."
Pull,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,18.0,1,"This is a huge bear-hug of a wine, from the effusive dark-fruit aromas through the rich, layered texture and ripe fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It is full bodied, well oaked, spicy and complex, with a mouthcoating texture and long finish."
Pull,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,18.0,2,"Here is a powerful mix of tart berry and pungent herb, that punches through with authority. It picks up fresh blackberry fruit and a lick of licorice as it powers through to a polished and persistent finish."
Puma Road,Pinot Noir,91.0,45.0,1,"From grapes grown at some of the Willamette Valley's highest elevations, this is a pungent mix of citrus oil, grapefruit, metal shavings and stone. The flavors persist along that path, crafting a sleek and distinctive wine that in many ways is the antithesis of the fleshy, jammy, fruit-forward style of many domestic Pinots."
Puma Road,Rosé,85.0,20.0,1,"Fresh-pressed boysenberries and blueberries meet with lilacs, Vietnamese coffee and a touch of cedar on the ripe, showy nose of this blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah. The thick, coffee-laden palate is full of deep blueberry fruit, sure to be an attention-grabber yet serious enough with bitter espresso and sour-plum skins."
Pure Cru,Cabernet Franc,92.0,65.0,1,"Fermented in 80% stainless steel and 20% barrel, this at first shows a touch of barrel reduction on the nose that dissipates into richly layered stone fruit and fresh lime. Lingering minerality provides freshness and perspective."
Pure Cru,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,48.0,1,"Spicy, lemony acidity balances out a classic barrel imprint of oakiness and toast in this medium-bodied, concentrated wine. Silky-smooth on the palate, it rewards patience in the glass and will pair well with rich, creamy foods."
Pure Cru,Red Blend,90.0,65.0,1,"Ripe, rich fruit flavors and a handsome streak of spicy oak make this full-bodied Rhône-style blend luscious and tempting. Great fruit concentration and a nicely viscous texture team up with soft tannins and an almost-sweet finish."
Purple Hands,Pinot Noir,89.96,44.17,24,"A vivid buttered-popcorn aroma and luscious vanilla and lemon-meringue flavors make this wine frothy and mouthfilling. Made in 100% new Hungarian oak barrels and aged for 20 months, it's full-bodied, so rich in texture that it seems almost sweet, with good balancing support from mild acidity."
Purple Hands,Red Blend,84.0,19.0,1,"Burly and powerful, this is an explosively complex and satisfying wine, full bodied and brooding in black cherry and tobacco, its tannins mild and lengthy."
Pursued by Bear,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,85.0,1,"This well-made wine opens in earthy compost and black licorice before unwinding a topknot of grippy tannin. Even with its power and concentration, it offers velvety mouthfeel and an expansive wave of juicy, robust acidity, particularly on the finish, making good use of smaller additions of Cab Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Merlot."
Pursued by Bear,Syrah,90.5,58.5,4,"This unusual rosé is all Pinot Gris, picked for thick skins, chewy tannins, high acidity, and given a 36-hour cold soak prior to fermentation. It's a pale salmon/copper shade, full-bodied and juicy, with fruit flavors of peach and citrus. Highlights of hibiscus tea and floral aromatics contribute further complexity."
Putah Creek,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,30.0,1,"This very small-production offering deserves its reserve labeling, a nicely balanced and concentrated wine with aromas and flavors of baked bread, big leather, cigar and black peppercorn. Tense on the finish, it shows promise of opening further in time. Drink now through 2023."
Quadrant,Red Blend,88.0,16.0,1,"The famous growers branch out into their own wines with aplomb in this 100% varietal wine, tangoing with a much sought-after grape from their property. Sanguine and gamy, it's structured in good acidity and low oak, showing a succulence of blackberry."
Quadrant,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.5,16.0,2,"This 100% varietal wine celebrates what the variety can do when planted in the right place. Remarkable layers of dried plum and cherry come with additional flavors of cocoa powder, coffee and leather. Smooth and medium bodied, it has a grip of tannin on the finish that mellows going down."
Quadrant,White Blend,86.0,16.0,1,"Cabernet makes up three-quarters of this blend. Appealing aromas of dried herbs, blue fruit, coffee and spice lead to sweet, full-feeling cherry and plum flavors backed by a light grip of tannins."
Quady,Black Muscat,90.0,23.5,2,"This wine entices with its nuanced aromas of mineral, spice, almond butter, lemon pith, tropical fruit and chamomile. The flavors are concentrated while still showing exquisite restraint along with pitch-perfect balance. The extended finish kicks it up a notch."
Quady,Moscato,87.33,14.0,3,"Owned by the producer, this vineyard is planted to small-cluster Dijon clones in the heart of the appellation, near San Pablo Bay. Rich and voluptuous, it's intensely oaken and decadent in tropical pineapple, guava and pear, finishing clean and full bodied."
Quady,Orange Muscat,93.0,25.0,1,"This vineyard is a premier site for this variety, taming the mean, green aromas and flavors it can be associated with. Aromas of peppery spices, green herbs and cherry are followed by soft, sultry dark fruit flavors that show exquisite balance and length."
Quady,Palomino,86.0,32.0,1,"This big mouthful of wine offers great value. Smelling like licorice and chocolate and tasting like superripe berries and black figs, this brute has full body, great concentration and richness of flavor, a thick but soothing texture, and a long, lingering finish."
Quady,Port,93.5,30.5,2,"A thick, decadent and dark wine with 5% Malbec blended in, this spent almost two years in nearly all new French oak, giving it a backbone of vanilla oak and toast. Atop that density and richness sits high-toned characteristics of plum and cassis."
Quady North,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,40.0,2,"Fresh pear and jasmine rise on the nose of this wine, a fulsome, full-bodied version of the variety that's creamy in vanilla and caramel undertones. Rewarding with food, it finishes fresh and fruity."
Quady North,Cabernet Franc,87.0,35.0,1,"Mourvèdre (47%) and Grenache (37%) are in the lead on this wine with the balance Syrah, Counoise and Picpoul. The aromas of red and black fruit, brown stems, green olive, coffee and spice are initially faint while the tart red-fruit flavors bring a sense of delicacy and restraint."
Quady North,Cabernet Franc-Merlot,91.33,40.0,3,"Don't be fooled by the Washington label. This is Yakima Valley fruit coming from a site next to esteemed Boushey Vineyard. Aromas of fresh herbs, brown stems, red fruit, graphite, bacon fat and orange peel lead to a mouthful of generous fruit flavors. The finish persists."
Quady North,Grenache,88.33,19.33,3,"From a site planted by Steve MacRostie in 1998, this white sings in complexity and tension, providing tart jolts of lemon verbena, ginger and nutmeg. Complex and elegant, especially in its floral perfume, it drinks voluptuously, full of come-hither ripeness."
Quady North,Grenache Blanc,90.0,21.5,2,"This may be the quintessential site among the extensive Milbrandt vineyards that produce much of the K Vintners Syrah lineup. The Northridge bottling has amazing purity and concentration, with a beguiling mix of deep berry fruits and gravelly minerality. Supple power, muscular and dense."
Quady North,Red Blend,87.0,40.0,1,"From the estate vineyard, located in the cobblestone-rich area known as The Rocks, this cellar-worthy effort is complex and riveting. Berries and citrus, juicy and tart, cling to the palate and pull through to a lingering finish. Pure and deep all the way through."
Quady North,Rhône-style White Blend,90.5,19.5,2,"A similar blend to the Ovide; this is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Syrah. The fruit is more forward here, with pretty blackberry and black cherry flavors, and a dark and forceful streak of iron and charcoal and licorice. A light lavender note adds interest."
Quady North,Syrah,89.9,39.0,10,"A deep and compact wine with Syrah fruit styled with a Cabernet-like verticality, this layers ripe berry fruit with streaks of graphite, ash and rock. The flavors persist through a lingering, super clean finish with the balance and acidity to age. What are initially tightly wound subtleties of herb and spice may well expand into nuanced complexity over the next decade or more."
Quady North,Viognier,89.0,22.33,6,"A Burgundian take on Viognier, barrel fermented in 30% new French oak, put through M-L, and aged 18 months in barrel. Predictably dark and smooth, with a rich mix of soft, ripe stone fruit and barrel flavors. It's a bold style, showing plenty of toast and oak, but also concentrated and peachy, with lemon verbena, Key lime and a hint of honey."
Quady North,White Blend,89.0,19.0,1,"With its excellent concentration of pure fruit power, this is like taking your mouth through a 100 yard dash of raspberry, blueberry and black cherry fruit, right down the heart of the throat. Along the way you find a tight wrapping of rock and espresso, but it's the snappy, sappy fruit that really shines here. Great length."
Quilceda Creek,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.33,70.0,3,"This wine is made from 57% Petit Verdot (a variety of increasing interest, it seems) from mountain sites. An additional 29% Cabernet Franc and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon help soften its tastes of black licorice, leather and black currant, dotted by a dash of black olive. Opaque in color, it's savory and sizable in body without becoming overly concentrated. Drink now through 2021."
Quilceda Creek,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,101.0,3,"This wine contains 7% estate Cabernet Franc, showing bittersweet elements of dark chocolate, cedar and currant around an extracted core that drinks full-bodied, boldly structured and lush."
Quilceda Creek,Red Blend,91.5,60.0,2,"A sour tinge of toasty oak invites one in aromatically and taste-wise in this vineyard-designate, from such a stellar Westside Road site. Gravenstein apple and melon pique the palate while it remains balanced and beautifully textured through the spicy finish."
Quinta Cruz,Albariño,88.0,18.0,1,"An enticing cedar and cinnamon aroma leads to robust spiced plum flavors and a lively combination of fine tannins and good acidity for balance. This is a bold, flavorful and ripe-tasting wine that also stays poised and appetizing. Not shabby at all and it should improve through at least 2020."
Quinta Cruz,Graciano,91.0,28.0,1,"There's an exotic perfumey-ness to this wine that almost suggests patchouli, so relaxed and complex it is. Medium-bodied with an inviting layering of black cherry and stemmy earthiness, it's curiously riddled in white pepper as it finishes."
Quinta Cruz,Port,88.0,30.0,1,"Known for great values, McManis has upped the ante with this outstanding blend made largely from Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. It has a gorgeous, spicy, new-leather, new-oak aroma, and similarly complex, minty and intriguing flavors. The wine tastes full-bodied, firmly tannic but well balanced and poised in style."
Quinta Cruz,Souzao,87.0,24.0,2,"Bright and vivacious black and red berries meet with dill, mint and white sage on the nose of this bottling from a historic vineyard, with a touch of sweet pine wood as well. Dried purple flowers are prominent on the sip, where touches of asphalt, charcoal and beef in a blackberry sauce are boosted by peppery spice."
Quinta Cruz,Tempranillo,90.0,20.0,3,"This wine plays at the edges of ripeness, providing well-structured citrus and spice atop layered acidity. Aromas of salted caramel give it an additional intrigue before a lean, fresh finish."
Quintet,Pinot Noir,90.25,48.0,4,"This lovely wine has a great depth of decadent, succulent aromas of citrus and apple blossom, that explode around tangy acidity. Pear, quince and lemongrass-ginger spice dot the palate in measured, beautiful ways, finishing balanced and crisp."
Quivira,Cabernet Blend,91.0,55.0,1,"A buttery style, this bottling offers popcorn, sea salt caramel and vanilla cookies on the nose alongside tropical coconut, ripe peach and banana fruit, all judiciously presented. There's an immediate sizzle of acidity to cut through the butter on the palate, where pan-fried apples, squeezed lemons and almonds make for an excellent California Chardonnay."
Quivira,G-S-M,88.0,34.0,1,"Now winemaker for Swanson, Robin Ackhurst excels here in this tiny production of his own wine, which exhibits exotic plum and juicy blackberry. A 100% varietal offering, it has a girth of structured tannin and toasty oak."
Quivira,Grenache,90.5,32.0,2,"Aromas of dried herb, bay leaf, spice, dried flowers and dark fruit are followed by tart, spritely cranberry and cherry flavors. It possesses a real sense of freshness and elegance."
Quivira,Red Blend,90.0,43.67,3,"This wine is an intrigue of lavender, rose and kirsch, young in firm tight tannins and tension. Black pepper, cherry and a light-bodied weight provide smooth drinkability and elegance, just waiting for the tannin to settle down. Drink now through 2020."
Quivira,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,36.0,2,"This big but smooth wine has a seductive spicy, oaky aroma, rich and generous fruit flavors, a good layer of tannin to add mouthfeel and a lingering, delicious finish. The layers of flavor match layers of texture for an irrestible combo. 10% Cabernet Franc and 4% of the Portuguese variety Touriga Nacional contribute to the flavor complexity."
Quivira,Rosé,93.0,22.0,1,"The sparkling wine producer shows off its prowess with still wines in this inaugural vineyard-designate from the well-loved Hyde. Tart lemon and green apple flavors highlight a brisk acidity that never tastes lean, and instead offers full-bodied luxury without the weight. Chameleon-like in that way, it's also juicy, structured and dotted in salty lemongrass."
Quivira,Sauvignon Blanc,91.33,27.33,3,"Sonas is half Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, and the rest Cabernet Franc. It has graham cracker scents and flavors, and a soft, smooth mouthfeel. The red plum fruit is swathed in plenty of mocha flavors; a most enjoyable, unpretentious wine."
Quivira,Zinfandel,90.86,42.71,7,"A blend of Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's ripe and succulent with notes of cherry, vanilla and sweet spices supported by tart acids and tightly wound tannins."
Qupé,Chardonnay,89.67,20.0,3,"Blended with ten percent Syrah and aged in neutral oak, this wine from the cool 2011 vintage brings notes of black pepper, plum, and game. It's full bodied and intense with tart flavors and firm, somewhat dry tannins."
Qupé,Grenache,91.0,35.0,1,"This new offering from Gamache Vintners is a Bordeaux-style blend made from 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced from the Gamache and Champoux vineyards. Pretty cherry lollipop fruit carries a whiff of barnyard, and the tannins finish with an herbal echo."
Qupé,Marsanne,91.0,31.5,2,"Made from organic grapes, Yorkville's light-bodied Merlot is dry and herbal, with cedar in spades rounded out by elegant plum and chocolate softness. This vintage has 10% Cabernet Sauvignon as well, and would match well with lighter meats, like chicken."
Qupé,Viognier,89.0,30.0,1,"Tart and spicy, the latest release of Adelsheim's iconic Auxerrois opens with grapefruit and lemon zest, shows excellent grip and length, and moves into subtle details of lime, citrus, and ginger. A unique and interesting wine, crisp as a new dollar bill."
Qupé,White Blend,87.0,17.0,2,"Dark in color and flavor, the Crannell brings ripe fruit flavors of black cherry and prune. Smooth and full-bodied, with an easy-drinking roundness to the mouthfeel, it finishes softly with all components well integrated."
R. Stuart & Co.,Pinot Noir,89.25,34.25,4,"Good concentration and a classic Oregon Pinot mix of herb and fruit characterize this winning effort. Dried herb, thistle, berry, cherry and a Dr. Pepper streak are all in the mix, with hints of earth and stem."
R2,Chardonnay,89.0,24.0,2,"Though no new oak was used in the élévage of this wine, it has a lovely, toasty backdrop to the aromas of fresh rose petals, spicy tobacco and tart plum. This is nicely rounded, keeping the acids from dominating and allowing the fruit to display itself gently and without any rough edges. In the mouth the acids come forward, but they are so fresh, natural and clean that it's a genuine pleasure."
R2,Grenache,89.0,31.0,2,"This tasty, well-built wine is light in color, moderate in fruit flavor and has interesting spicy accents. The mouthfeel is broad and generous but also nicely supported by a light lacing of tannin."
R2,Grenache Blanc,87.0,25.0,1,"From a promising winery in the Morgan Hill area south of San Jose, this blend of 48% Grenache, 36% Syrah, 12% Mourvèdre, 2% Carignane and 2% Petite Sirah shows deep, dark but not juicy black plum, condensed coffee and game aromas. There's firm structure to the palate, which is dense yet dry with elderberry, dark chocolate and violet flavors."
R2,Pinot Noir,88.5,46.67,6,"This wine is an unusual blend of Barbera (40%), Malbec (25%), Sangiovese (21%) and Cabernet Franc. It works, with aromas of sweet baking spices, vanilla, cherry and herb that are followed by generous, velvety cherry flavors. The oak is very primary but it still brings appeal."
R2,Rhône-style White Blend,85.0,24.0,1,"Perhaps Temecula's future is in Super Tuscans. This balanced blend of 50% Sangiovese, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc offers a complex nose of cranberry, pomegranate, pencil lead and chocolate sauce. Flavors of hot brick, white pepper, raspberry and stewed mushrooms rock the palate."
Rabble,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,25.0,1,"Earthy cherry and wild strawberry notes form the core of this deep, concentrated and yet not overly dense wine. Herbal and teasingly tart as it shifts from midpalate to finish, it offers a last splash of nutmeg on the finale."
Rabble,Merlot,87.0,25.0,1,"This standout blend—the best from this winery to date—is 68% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. It offers a complex assortment of cocoa, pencil lead, tomato leaf, mocha, cherry and herb aromas. The café au lait flavors are silky soft and concentrated, framed by bright acidity and showing an exquisite sense of balance and texture that carries through the lingering finish."
Rabble,Red Blend,88.0,15.0,2,"This lower alcohol-style wine from the biodynamic-minded producer shows cranberry, orange rinds, chaparral scrub, dried oregano and a mix of green and kalamata olives on the nose. It's very savvy on the palate, with minced parsley, olive tapenade, cracked peppercorns and caper berries, all framed by mouth-watering acidity."
Rabble,Rosé,88.0,15.0,2,"Subtle aromatics of earthy rose petal surround this silky, light wine, steeped in acidity and a damp-forested quality. Spicy throughout in cinnamon, cardamom and grated nutmeg, the wine picks up a girth of thickness on the finish, a knot of tannin that gives it a swath of complexity and cellaring possibilities, through 2018."
Rabble,Zinfandel,92.0,25.0,1,"A blend of 52% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc and 6% Petit Verdot, this wine is aromatically brooding with notes of coffee, mineral, flowers and cherry. The palate boasts abundant coffee and cherry flavors backed by firm tannins that need time in the cellar to stretch their legs. Best after 2021, with a long life ahead of it."
Rack & Riddle,Sparkling Blend,87.86,20.57,7,"Made from a barrel selection of Keefer Ranch grapes, this wine flirts in juicy grenadine and red licorice on the nose, before developing into a more complex expression of supple tannins and likable acidity. Ripe and blood-orange sweet on the finish, it delivers elegance and finesse without holding back on the appellation's exuberance of fruit."
Rahn,Grenache-Mourvèdre,87.0,25.0,1,"Made from a single-vineyard source of Pinot Noir grapes, this lovely pinkish-red wine is a celebration of wild strawberry. Dry, crisp and refreshing, it offers a twist of citrus on the finish and a floral backbone of honeysuckle."
Rail2Rail,Zinfandel,86.0,15.5,2,"This wine is a blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 5% Syrah. It offers roasty-toasty aromas of dark coffee, bittersweet chocolate, char and cherry. The palate is appealing and silky in texture, showing elegant styling but with a lot of flavor intensity, followed by a lengthy finish. It's a pleasing mix of grace and power, barrel and fruit."
Rain Dance,Riesling,90.0,22.0,1,"Preserved lemon and lemon curd combine for dramatic effect in this wine sourced from three estate-grown vineyard sites. Fleshy on the palate, it continues the lemon theme throughout, with weighty additions of oak and crème brûlée that hit their peak on the finish."
Rain Dance,Rosé,90.0,22.0,1,"Silky in blueberry and boysenberry fruit, this is a balanced Pinot, tending toward black and blue fruit over red, with a bouquet of rose petals and truffled earth. With just a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg, it develops spiciness on the palate, finishing light and bright."
Rainstorm,Rosé,88.0,17.33,3,"Winemaker Justin Mund worked at Laetitia for four years, so he knows the blocks, and picks this one well. The nose shows blackberry fruit but the unique parts are the beef blood and gamy pork aromas. It's sanguine on the palate at first, then opens to Bing cherries and eucalyptus oil."
Rally Point Wines,Chardonnay,88.0,38.0,2,"Extremely pungent yet not overdone aromas of ruby red grapefruit, tropical flowers and passion-fruit juice show on this great interpretation of the often sweet-leaning grape. Despite the showy nose, it's quite tight and dry on the palate, with flavors of pear and apple skins, lime rinds and yellow grapefruit."
Rally Point Wines,Marsanne-Roussanne,89.0,28.0,1,"Wild berry and vanilla rise to the fore on this rose-petal-piqued vineyard-designate, the site planted by this producer. There's some girth on the midpalate, and depth of flavor, along with a supportive structure of oak and tannin, the entirety teased in complexity. It finishes juicy and refreshing in pomegranate, wild mushroom and spice."
Rally Point Wines,Pinot Noir,90.0,38.0,1,"This wine doesn't hold back from the representative California-style on its rich and strong nose: candied apples, browned butter, vanilla candies, sea salt caramel, browned marshmallow, even some Olroso Sherry tones. Yet the palate brings it all into focus, with bitter peach skin, pithy lime and grippy apricot playing the foil to vanilla bean and butter. It's a bold yet expertly restrained wine."
Rally Point Wines,Viognier,85.0,28.0,1,"Hailing mostly from renowned Les Collines (44%) and Lewis (41%) vineyards and rounded out by up-and-comer Stoney Vine, this wine isn't fully ready to reveal its aromatic charms. Notes of dried herb, green olive, licorice, earth and boysenberry are out in front of brooding blue and red fruit. The flavors, however, are in full bloom, with palate-coating, focused and almost creamy cherry and plum notes that persist on the finish."
Ram,Cabernet Franc,86.0,25.0,1,"Here is a generous, full-throttle, high-octane Zin, with lots of rich oak accents and a touch of sweetness. Aromas of strawberry jam, maple syrup and hickory-smoked bacon are followed by rich fruit flavors, full body, light tannins and a jammy finish."
Ram,Malbec,85.0,25.0,1,"Flowery and balanced in crisp, dry flavors of lemon and pear, this wine takes its designation from the French word for fog, a nod to its cool-climate environs. Supple tannins and refined acidity round out the deal."
Ram,White Blend,85.0,18.0,1,"Bristling in acidity and steely in wet stone, this SB is crisp and layered in lemon, with more lemon on the finish. It yearns for shellfish."
Ram's Gate,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,64.0,1,"Only the faint smell of grass emerges from this wine, but the palate is another story, with fresh squeezed lime and brisk nectarine flavors. The mouthfeel starts rich and then zips up tight with nice acidity. This vibrant wine needs food that's both rich and exotic, so try Chinese or Indonesian."
Ram's Gate,Chardonnay,91.71,70.29,7,"A Cabernet with 12% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot blended in, all from Sonoma Valley's Rancho Salina Vineyard, this wine is medium in weight and viscous. A nice mix of cedar and herbs play against savory cranberry and tobacco. The balanced acidity gives it a lift."
Ram's Gate,Grenache,92.0,70.0,1,"Coming from a cool-climate appellation in a cool vintage and aged in neutral French oak, this wine has a vivid, precise fruit focus. Notes of black currant and blackberry are framed by tart, lively acidity and firm, dry tannins."
Ram's Gate,Pinot Noir,90.29,69.43,7,"Light and crisp, it offers layers of lemon chiffon and spicy pear. The at-first luxurious mouthfeel evolves smoothly into crisper, citrus-wrapped acidity. This is a sippable, ideal summer wine."
Ram's Gate,Syrah,89.5,62.0,4,"This limited reserve incorporates the best of 82 different lots, some done in stainless steel, some in neutral oak, and some in concrete eggs. Phenomenal concentration reveals a wine packed with powerful fruit flavors that cover the spectrum of citrus, apple, peach and pear. The luscious combination is supported with natural acidity and an underlying minerality. It's deep, long and satisfying, with the structure to age for decades."
Ramey,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,146.25,4,"Earthy aromas of black loam and graphite give complexity to accents of beet juice and dried purple flowers on this wine by longtime Rideau Winery winemaker Andres Ibarra, who also manages La Presa Vineyard. Deep purple florals of violet and lavender hit the palate along with cooked peppercorns, sweet plums and spiced cherries, making for an elegant and complex package."
Ramey,Chardonnay,94.67,65.0,9,"One of the region's premiere bottlings, this vintage's blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc by winemaker Scott Shirley offers dried figs, raw meats, cigar box, chopped mint and red berries on the nose. The palate combines dried cherries, black currants and blueberry with a lavish amount of black pepper."
Ramey,Pinot Noir,91.0,60.0,1,"One of the region's top producers excels at exploring single-vineyard bottlings, and this is one of the best. A reductive nose of burnt rubber sinks into a fantastic menthol character, laid across plump black currants. The palate thrives on a minty blackberry element and complex black pepper and creosote flavors. A strong tannic structure ensures the best sipping 2018–2025."
Ramey,Syrah,94.5,70.0,4,"This has lots of fresh berry aromas, blending raspberry, strawberry and deeper blackberry. Full bodied, it features ripe flavors, velvety mouthfeel and firm tannins. Dry and well balanced, it will make a great dinner wine because of all the palate-cleansing texture. Drink now through 2022."
Ramseyer,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,42.0,1,"This big red offers opulent fruit aromas, like ripe blackberries and strawberries, followed by concentrated fruit flavors interwoven with slightly herbal, meaty accents. Full bodied but not at all coarse, it has a very smooth texture, moderate tannins and mouth-filling richness."
Ramspur,Pinot Noir,84.0,64.0,1,"Very light in color, this bubbly shows ripe apples, caramelized pears, nectarine flesh, yellow cake and the slightest hint of roasted nuts, marzipan and yeast on the dynamic nose. Nuttiness and yeastiness also touch the tightly wound and tart palate, flavored further with seared pineapple, apricot and apple flesh elements."
Ranchero Cellars,Carignan,93.0,32.0,1,"A fascinatingly flavorful wine by South African Ernst Storm, this shows very perfumed apple peels, pungent green pears and telltale grass shavings on the nose, all lifted by white pepper, wet thyme and hints of dried peaches. The incredibly vibrant palate, with lots of energy and acidity yet not in a biting way, offers flavors of rainy cement, limestone, Granny Smith apple skins and more grass."
Ranchero Cellars,Grenache Blanc,89.0,28.0,1,"Showing a light whiff of funk, this seems a bit reductive at first, but opens gracefully with adequate aeration. Black cherry and dark chocolate flavors combine and thread into a medium finish with some of that same earthy character."
Ranchero Cellars,Viognier,89.0,30.0,1,"Blakeslee brings a wine with pinpoint aromas of beet root, ripe strawberries and accents of Dr Pepper and clove. Young and tart, it remains compact but shows an elegant profile, with the promise of further development. Drink now through 2030."
Rancho Maria,Zinfandel,90.0,42.0,1,"Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this reserve comes from a three-acre block of an estate vineyard. Dark, fleshy plum and soft, supple tannins give it a fruit-tinged structure and lushness, alongside plenty of full-bodied chocolate, tobacco and a hint of mint."
Rancho Sisquoc,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,26.5,2,"An eminently drinkable blend of 50% Marsanne and 50% Grenache Blanc, this shows a delicate honey aroma on the nose, along with apricot-filled brioche and sweetly cooked chanterelle mushrooms. It's very light and restrained on the palate. Nectarine flesh, yellow peaches and dried mango gain structure and depth from a lime peel tartness and chalky minerality."
Rancho Sisquoc,Chardonnay,89.0,22.0,1,"Here is a well-built, Bordeaux-style blend based largely upon Cabernet Sauvignon, with 12% Malbec and 6% Petit Verdot filling it out. Firm, dark and muscular, this mixes tart black fruit flavors with streaks of licorice and peppery herbs."
Rancho Sisquoc,Meritage,89.0,31.67,3,"This captures the spicy vitality of Les Collines Merlot, with pretty cherry and plum fruit set against a smattering of new oak toast. It's a clean, well-defined wine that continues into a tasty finish with highlights of roasted walnuts and clove."
Rancho Sisquoc,Merlot,88.33,20.67,3,Steely cranberries and earthy tannins control the palate here. As the wine sits in the mouth a certain sense of green coffee beans arises. The finish is light and supple.
Rancho Sisquoc,Pinot Noir,87.0,30.0,2,"Chocolate graham cracker and a Port-like aroma of ripeness dominate in this wine, which adds in Carignane and Petite Sirah. Good acidity and a softness of texture complete the picture."
Rancho Sisquoc,Red Blend,91.0,22.0,1,"Young, bright raspberry fruit brings fresh, forward flavors front and center. There's a touch of cherry Popsicle also. It's an undeniably pretty wine, ready to drink, though don't look for much in the way of either depth or concentration."
Rancho Sisquoc,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,18.0,1,"A pleasant, though generic wine, this brings light touches of apple, pear and peach, underscored with moderate acidity. Though barrel fermented, it seems more in line with most stainless steel Chardonnays, with hints of herb throughout."
Rancho Sisquoc,Syrah,90.0,25.0,3,Attractive hints of oak in the aroma and fresh cherry-berry flavors make this medium-bodied wine interesting. A good layer of fine tannins adds welcome traction to the texture.
Rancho Zabaco,Zinfandel,90.0,15.0,2,"This unusual blend, all co-fermented, includes roughly equal proportions of Vermentino, Viognier and Marsanne, with a splash of Roussanne. It's perfumed with the intensity of Gewürztraminer, a mix of baby powder and candied citrus, and those flavors carry through the palate. Though listed as just 12.5% abv, it tastes and feels much riper, showing some heat in the aftertaste."
Random Wine,Syrah,86.0,29.0,1,"Chewy and tannic, this rugged wine puts Pinot in Cabernet clothing. The black-cherry fruit carries a streak of cola, and a slight sense of rubber in the finish."
Ransom,Pinot Noir,87.0,27.0,1,"In 2004 winemaker Chuck Reininger put the accent on Merlot (45%), filling in the rest with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Syrah. Sweet and sappy, spicy and loaded with chocolate and cherries, it's a real flavor-packing bombshell that is sure to delight."
Raphael,Chardonnay,85.0,15.0,1,"The Celilo vineyard, located on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge appellation, is one of the most unique in the region. This ripe, almost liquorous Merlot is bursting with sappy cherry fruit, buttressed with tangy acids. The structure is here to more than support the weight of the wine and its alcohol, just under 15%. Barrel flavors of bourbon and vanilla dominate the finish."
Raptor Ridge,Grüner Veltliner,87.0,20.0,1,"This is very well made, smooth and supple. The round, approachable fruit tastes of red currant, red berry, and black olive. There is a flash of heat in the back of the throat, but it offer excellent value. Unfortunately it's very limited—just 99 cases."
Raptor Ridge,Pinot Noir,88.39,40.06,18,"Bedell continues to raise the bar for Long Island Merlot with this offering. A rich, savory nose of meat, leather spice and dark berry leads into a poised balance of savory spice, rich fruit, acids and tannins. The wine has a friendly brightness about it but overall, is restrained and integrated."
Rare,Red Blend,86.5,11.0,2,"There's a basket of ripe raspberry and strawberry in this earthy, single-vineyard designated wine, an earthiness that doesn't let go. Truffle and damp forest meet in the middle to introduce dusty, dense tannins that will benefit from time and air."
Rare,Rosé,87.0,10.0,1,"A swirl of fresh berries and sour cranberries, rust and a touch of asphalt greet the nose on this wine from one of the more beautiful vineyards in California. The flavors also touch on ripe, juicy blackberries and tart black plum skins."
Rarecat,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,100.0,1,"Chalky tannins and dried herb mark the entry of this wine, which stays varietal despite the addition of 14% Cabernet Sauvignon. Sage, peppercorn and high-toned cherry complete the picture, with well-integrated, generous tannins framing the overall picture, finishing in swirls of cinnamon and vanilla."
Rarecat,Chardonnay,91.0,65.0,1,"Organically grown and selected from a mix of specific vineyard blocks, Rex Hill's reserve is rather light in 2007, with tannins that are a bit out of proportion to the fruit. It's a carefully controlled effort, but thin and dilute, with strawberry/watermelon fruit and some tomato leaf creeping into the finish."
Rasa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.25,95.0,4,"This is a sharp, tart Pinot, scented with pine needles and showing wild strawberry fruit flavors and plenty of sharp acidity. In the mouth the fruit also reveals a cherry candy core, pretty but brief, and quickly winds down through a citrusy finish."
Rasa,Cabernet Franc,91.33,36.0,3,"There's a warm leathery character to the squeezed black cherry, black plum and violet notes on the nose of this wine from a vineyard on Paso's westside. Flavors are rustic and tart with barely ripe berries, showing balanced zing that lasts a long time as well as a grippy texture."
Rasa,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.6,83.0,5,"Very inviting, incredibly rich aromas of butterscotch, crème brûlée, peach custard, lemon curds, honeysuckle and caramelized banana show on this wine's thick nose. The palate offers orange peels cooked in a buttery sauce, marshmallows and marzipan."
Rasa,Chardonnay,90.0,45.0,1,"There's a smoky, char-like quality to this wine, a blend of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot. Soft and supple on the palate, dried tobacco and cherry intermix, along with leather and coffee, letting the more savory elements speak loudly. It finishes with a hint of sage."
Rasa,Grenache,91.0,57.5,2,"This easy-drinking blend of 86% Viognier, 8% Roussanne, 3% Marsanne and 3% Grenache Blanc—featuring a sailboat painting by Santa Barbara artist Chris Potter—offers aromas of flambéed bananas and toasted coconut on the nose. The palate shows grapefruit pith and the warmth of browned pears and seared red apples, seasoned with a nice sparkle of acidity."
Rasa,Mourvèdre,91.67,46.67,3,"This wine is easy to like at first taste, a heady, interesting combination of ripe, rich red fruit and spicy earth, accented in black tea and truffle. Soft in texture, and from a wonderful grower, it may have gotten overly ripe, finishing a touch hot."
Rasa,Petit Verdot,93.0,55.0,2,"Effervescent lemon, lime and grapefruit and a flinty edge define this crisp white, aged mostly in stainless steel. A ripe, unctuous finish gives the wine subtle power and voluptuousness."
Rasa,Red Blend,88.5,45.5,2,"The barrel influence plays prominently on the aromas, with notes of cocoa, vanilla and spice that show some warmth. On the palate, a mix of fruit and barrel flavors conveys creamy dark fruit, caramel and vanilla."
Rasa,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.33,58.33,3,"The herb, grapefruit, tropical fruit and melon aromas are light but very varietal. The palate has a slight spritz that perks up the tangy fruit flavors."
Rasa,Riesling,87.0,30.0,2,"All varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from Beverly, Shaw and Stone Tree vineyards. Aged in all-new French oak, it leads with barrel spices followed by aromas and flavors of medicine cabinet, cherry and chocolate. It offers appeal but the tannins need time to unwind."
Rasa,Syrah,92.75,73.75,8,"A medium cherry-red color, this wine offer fruit-filled aromas of strawberry bubble gum, pomegranate and cherry. It drinks a hair off dry, with broad, fleshy fruit flavors that linger."
Ravenswood,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,50.0,1,"Aromatically, this wine seems locked up with notes of tire rubber, herbs, pepper, woodspice and plum. Favors are supple and reserved in style. It's a unique expression of the variety from this cool vintage."
Ravenswood,Petite Sirah,87.0,10.0,1,"A slightly sour red-apple and light strawberry aroma meets with a touch of watermelon and cotton candy on the nose of this blend of 76% Grenache, 10% Syrah, 8% Mission, 4% Zinfandel and 2% Cinsault. There is lots of citrus zing to the nectarine-driven palate, which also shows some pink-lemonade flavors."
Ravenswood,Red Blend,88.0,42.43,7,This wine is half Syrah with the rest equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah. Aromas of wet copper penny and herb are followed by sweet blue fruit flavors supported by firm tannins. The varieties seem to tussle.
Ravenswood,Zinfandel,89.59,34.71,17,"Fleshy in pineapple and papaya, with a pinch of Sémillon blended within, this wine displays itself in a fuller-bodied style, quite ripe and robust, with strong, lingering flavors of dried apricot and vanilla."
Ravines,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,83.0,25.0,1,"this full-bodied white wine stresses complexity, weight and viscosity. It smells like blanched almonds and candle wax, and tastes rich, almost heavy."
Raylee,Pinot Noir,87.0,29.0,1,"This medium-bodied wine has earthy, almost salty aromas, good acidity, herb and melon flavors and a fresh mouthfeel. Its sea-breeze character suggests seafood as a good pairing."
Raylee,Red Blend,86.0,25.0,1,"A 100% varietal wine, on the nose this suggests a pungency of French bread, which doesn't open up for much else aromatically. On the medium-bodied palate, expect a mix of viscous honey and baked peach."
Raymond,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.3,78.74,23,"Easygoing and soft in texture, this medium-bodied red wine has fruity, jammy aromas and flavors, and blends in a little black pepper for interest."
Raymond,Chardonnay,90.0,52.67,3,"Oaky bacon and barbecue smoke make for a burly wine-drinking experience in this full-bodied, expressive and somewhat heavy offering from the Dry Creek winery's estate."
Raymond,Meritage,89.0,32.0,1,"A rare finding of this variety in California, this wine is golden-orange in color and offers resin-like sweetness that may not appeal to everybody."
Raymond,Merlot,90.0,24.0,1,"Made entirely from Cinsault, this copper-orange-colored wine comes in a swank square bottle, but delivers a tart, sour quality that veers slightly metallic."
Raymond,Petite Sirah,87.0,45.0,1,"There's something overripe and flat about this wine, which conveys a mix of Dr Pepper, chocolate and vanilla that doesn't impress."
Raymond,Sauvignon Blanc,87.5,23.0,2,"This wine smells like a Danish pastry, with strong, very sweet almond flavors that cling to the taste buds long after sipping."
Reasons,Syrah,91.0,35.0,1,"It brings a Northwest Cabernet profile of black currant, plum, licorice and light herbs with medium-bodied feel. A touch of sweetness rounds out the finish."
Reata,Pinot Noir,87.0,25.0,1,"A perfumed wine with notes of candied orange, peach and lavender. The palate is sweet and easy drinking. Chill down and enjoy."
Record Family Wines,Red Blend,91.0,22.0,1,"Note the vintage—2009. This is already moving into maturity, loaded with berry-pie fruit flavors, especially blueberry. It's soft and drinking well, with cinnamon and baking spices in abundance. Don't delay—enjoy it over the next couple of years."
Record Family Wines,Syrah,89.0,35.0,2,"Dark and richly colored, this juicy, mouthwatering, generously oaked wine has a high quotient of blackberry and raspberry. It is as rich on the palate as it is in color, getting better in the glass."
Red 7,Red Blend,85.0,24.0,1,"A banner vintage delivers a wine with nicely delineated layers of flavor, from fleshy tropical fruit into streaks of slightly bitter-skin flavors, herb and banana cream pie. It's long, lush and deliciously lively."
Red C,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,24.0,1,"A barrel selection from the estate and Shaw vineyards, this spent a couple of years in new French oak. It shows good concentration and oak influence. Cassis fruit is underscored with vivid acidity, and the wine retains its balance through a long finish that offers highlights of smoke and char."
Red Car,Pinot Noir,92.0,63.78,9,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot split the blend with 8% Syrah in addition. The opening scents are toasty and inviting, and the wine enters the palate smooth and agreeable, with pretty red fruits. There's a lick of licorice and then the flavors seem to lighten up and finish tart and astringent. But decant this and let it breathe, and the wine can surprise with its staying power."
Red Car,Roussanne,90.0,42.0,1,"Sourced from an outstanding vineyard, this juicy, spicy, zesty Riesling shows terrific balance and lively acidity. A mix of peach, green apple and Key lime fruit anchors a thoroughly refreshing wine, with just a touch of residual sugar."
Red Car,Syrah,93.0,51.67,3,"A subtle style of Viognier, this has body and presence without overt fruit flavors. It soothes the palate with a creamy viscosity. Modest apple and mineral flavors interact with crisp acidity for a low-key, reserved and well-mannered personality."
Red Mare,Chardonnay,91.0,40.0,1,"From a 90-year-old vineyard, this begins with a lean blackberry nose and other pointed dark-red to deep-purple fruits, all nicely laced with minerality and herbs. The flavors are dynamic, slipping from cranberry to pomegranate to cherry juice. A black tea finish framed by strong tannins ensures long cellar life. Drink 2018–2022."
Red Newt Cellars,Gewürztraminer,84.0,39.0,2,"Balanced and fairly light, this is nuanced in apple, pear and quince, with soft tannins and eager acidity that comes off as bright citrus. The texture has some creaminess that isn't overdone and the finish revisits the themes of lemon and lime."
Red Newt Cellars,Pinot Gris,87.0,23.0,1,"This Bordeaux-style blend is 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cab Franc, Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. The winery states it's their “signature wine,” combining fruit from Dineen, DuBrul, Meek and Sheridan vineyard sources. Despite its age, the wine remains tight and tart, with the balance and structure for further cellaring."
Red Rock,Merlot,87.0,14.0,2,"This wine is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, followed by smaller percentages of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, the lot aged almost two years in 75% new French oak. It presents itself as a classic example of the vintage and the valley, robustly bold and approachable in sage and red berry with a sturdy, sizable structure."
Red Rock,Pinot Noir,85.0,14.0,3,"Lots of richness and a multi-layered personality make this deep-colored, full-bodied wine delicious and interesting too. It's a big red, with bold berry and black cherry flavors, an especially attractive texture that's velvety and firm at the same time, and a long, lingering finish."
Red Rock,Red Blend,89.0,14.0,2,"A salty lick of saline brings the palate to attention before tingling acidity seals the experience: the wine's backbone a nicely balanced combination of generous oak that supports ripe fruit. Francois Freres and Taransaud barrels cradled the wine for 10 months, only 35% of it new, making for a robust yet elegant expression of the variety from this site."
Red Sky,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,40.0,1,"An estate-grown wine from an Oakville-based producer, this is an opaque, concentrated expression of black fig and gunpowder, girded by sturdy tannin and a richness of black cherry and berry. It reveals the power of the appellation well, and a ripeness of the vintage."
Red Stich,Pinot Noir,93.0,54.0,1,"This combination of 63% Roussanne with 37% Viognier goes through native fermentation and given time in neutral oak, making for a refined, light-bodied white pungent in pretty honeysuckle. Sharp acidity provides a powerfully lingering zip on the finish, the whole punctuated in herb and honey."
Red Stitch,Chardonnay,92.0,50.0,2,"Winemaker Chris Pisani used small American oak barrels to age this well-made, generous wine, which opens in a sweetness of vanilla bean, grilled peach and toasted oak. Richness and concentration make friends with a decent level of minerality and plenty of length, the wine made in a full-bodied style."
Red Stitch,Pinot Noir,92.33,55.33,3,"Underripe lemons, yellow roses, cut apples and white lilies are bolstered by an intriguing, light cinnamon spice on the nose of this bottling. It's a bit like sipping on honeysuckle tea, as the palate is sizzling with acidity and packed with flavors of lemon oil, green apple skins and tangerine rinds."
Red Table Cellars,Zinfandel,88.0,25.0,1,"From a vineyard atop the Cuesta Grade, this atypical yet awesome blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petite Sirah, 5% Petit Verdot and 2% Malbec shows blackberries, beef char, pencil lead, coffee beans and a touch of dried dill on the nose. Though flavors are still unfolding, there's plenty of blueberry, violet, lavender, soy, dried strawberry and night jasmine on the palate."
Red Tail Ridge,Chardonnay,86.5,14.5,2,"A Cabernet-heavy blend with 7% Sangiovese and 3% Petit Verdot, this wine marks the twentieth vintage of the producer's flagship wine, sourced from both its estate Cloudy's Vineyard and several Beckstoffer heritage sites. Black and green olives dance on the nose and palate first, followed by a concentration of cedar, pencil lead and black tea. It's powerful without being overly concentrated."
Red Tail Ridge,Rosé,84.0,17.0,1,"This is the deal of the century for wine made at this level from vines dating back as far as 1881, the wine sourced from two sites, the Saitone and Banfield ranches. Yeasty baked bread and juicy strawberry commingle around black currant and blood orange, the texture smoothly seductive, with a cradling of dried herb as a back note."
Red Theory,Red Blend,84.0,12.0,1,"Orion Stang's stylish winery produces a solid bottling here, starting with blackberry jam, pressed violets and cedar flakes on the dense and brooding nose. The palate offers well integrated flavors of boysenberry, lavender, woody elderberry, herb-crusted beef roast and a minty, purple flowers sensation that lingers into the finish."
Red Thread Wines,Red Blend,88.0,65.0,2,"This is such a refreshing take on the variety, still robust and rich in body, yet possessed of firm acidity and a crispness of cherry kirsch and pomegranate. It practically shouts violets and roses on the nose, following through on the palate with a delicacy of power that's entirely surprising. The finish is a mix of allspice and white pepper."
Redgate,Pinot Gris,83.0,15.0,1,"From a vineyard on the western edge of the cool climate appellation comes this great wine, with touches of butter, almond, white flower buds and lime pith on the nose. The palate is high and tight, structured by Meyer lemon pith, made savory by sea salt and warmed up with savory melted butter on the finish."
Redhawk,Pinot Noir,87.55,26.36,11,"There's no mistaking the variety, with plentiful aromas of fresh herb and cherry alongside vanilla and light barrel accents. The dark fruit flavors are supple with a mesmerizing texture and an exquisite balance that extends through the coffee-filled finish. The attention to detail throughout is impressive, especially for a wine at this price."
Redwood Creek,Zinfandel,87.0,8.0,1,"This stylishly labeled wine by Adam Lazarre and Christian Tietje shows salted apples, lime blossoms and white flowers on the nose. The energetic palate offers just-cut green pears at first, then opens into a touch of vanilla. It tightens back down on green apple peels before ending with vanilla cream. The wine delivers a full experience."
Refugio Ranch,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.67,39.33,3,"Rich and concentrated in red cherry, cigar and plum, this demurely approachable and enjoyable wine has the legs to age. Structured and tightly drawn, it holds a tannic overbite that eases in the glass. Cellar through 2017."
Refugio Ranch,Rhône-style White Blend,90.0,24.0,1,"A 100% varietal wine, this still has a puckering sense to the tannins, the power and weight of the wine generous and robust. Leather and banana figure into the bouquet, with the savory-laden flavors leaning toward black pepper and dark, ripe plum. This wine needs time; cellar through 2022."
Refugio Ranch,Roussanne-Viognier,91.0,30.0,1,"Almost clear in color, this wine has pungently floral aromas of honeysuckle that pave the way for sizzling acidity and fresh layers of peach and lime zest to complement one another on the palate. Refreshing, light bodied and dry, this is a wonderful additional to any arsenal of aromatic wines for summertime enjoyment."
Refugio Ranch,Sauvignon Blanc,88.4,24.8,5,"A new project from winemakers Mark McNeilly and Trey Busch, this wine leads with aromas of fresh green herbs, raspberries, dark chocolate and cherry. The palate is full bore but not overweighted, showing intensity to the red and black fruit flavors."
Refugio Ranch,Syrah-Petite Sirah,92.0,52.0,1,"A Southern Rhône-style blend, this wine shows aromas of cranberry, raspberry, fresh herbs and peppery spices. The flavors show purity, richness and restraint, with a finish that lingers."
Regusci,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,50.0,1,"Using dry-farmed grapes, Ryan Pease crafts a heavily structured wine with aromas of black gravel, mocha and blueberries reduced in a vanilla vinaigrette. The sticky tannins will need some time to unravel, but the flavors of cooked cherries, blackberries and coffee paste are promising. Drink 2018–2024."
Reininger,Carmenère,89.0,47.67,3,"Tart cherry, ripe plum and black cherry flavors and barely a trace of detectable oak character make this a lively, fruit-driven wine. The aroma has touches of clove and black pepper, the texture is not too rich but braced with firm acidity and tannins that keep the fruit flavors zooming along through the finish."
Reininger,Chardonnay,91.0,48.0,1,"Voluptuously exotic in Asian pear and honeyed hazelnut on the nose, this savory and ultimately lean wine is balanced and elegant, with a richness of texture and juicy mouthfeel on the midpalate and finish. Made in small quantities, it has a lovely label and is well worth looking out for."
Reininger,Malbec,90.0,45.0,1,"A blend of Sangiovese (38%), Merlot (31%) and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine displays each in turn with aromas and flavors of dried herbs, coffee, tobacco and cherry. The style is reserved, with plenty of fruit and acid but subtle oak—perfect for the dinner table."
Reininger,Red Blend,90.33,34.0,3,"No punches are pulled on this blend of Dionysus, Northridge, Red Heaven and Stone Tree vineyards. Light aromas of coffee, toffee and herbs lead to über rich, sweet, high-octane cherry flavors that are backed by grainy tannins."
Reininger,Syrah,91.0,41.0,1,"Aromas of cocoa, coffee, flowers and herbs lead to a velvety palate that possesses a real sense of texture, flavor and balance. The finish lingers."
Reininger,Sémillon,90.33,36.0,3,"Tart and tangy in orange and lime, this wine conveys an undeniable freshness that one won't soon forget, with a bright, focused acidity at its core. Mouthwateringly succulent in lemon custard and brioche as it develops and lengthens in the glass, it offers the best of vibrancy and voluptuousness."
Remy,Lagrein,86.0,50.0,1,"This is the first vintage of this 100% varietal, vineyard-designate for the producer, a mountaintop site 1,900 feet high. Red, rocky volcanic soils contribute a dusty concentration to the wine that shows a graceful grip of cranberry, cherry and currant wrapped in buoyant acidity. A wisp of smoke appears at the end."
Rendarrio Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,45.0,1,"There is a healthy dose of 22% Petit Verdot in this bold, juicy wine, rich in wild raspberry and cassis aromas and flavors. Graphite and chocolate fill out the dense, integrated midpalate, complemented by tangy acidity that provides structure and a hint of grace."
Rendarrio Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,40.0,3,"Velvety, robust structure makes way for a textured, complex personality of baked plum, rhubarb and cola spice. That spice continues in lengthy spikes of clove and cinnamon, providing a warmth that complements and accents the concentration."
Rendarrio Vineyards,Chardonnay,90.0,30.0,2,"Young and compact, this well-made, single vineyard Pinot is layered with cranberry, raspberry and black-cherry fruit. Tannins remain a bit stiff, and the acids assertive, with a muscular, tannic finish. Give this a bit more cellar time, and drink 2020–2030."
Rendarrio Vineyards,Grenache-Syrah,92.0,34.0,1,"This complex spicy wine is tangled up in blue fruits—plum and blueberry—with a side order of raspberries. It's bright, youthful, in perfect balance, and sporting a palate-pleasing toasty note."
Rendarrio Vineyards,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,34.0,1,"A welcome new entry in the burgeoning Oregon sparkling wine scene, this vintage-dated, all Pinot Noir cuvée can stand right alongside the best in the U.S. Details in both aroma and flavor bring elements of sweet hay, lemon rind, pineapple and green apple, with fine bead and impressive length."
Rendarrio Vineyards,Syrah,91.0,34.0,1,"Still tasting quite young, this potent Pinot brings a dark streak of smoke and a splash of citrus to its core black-fruit flavors. The tannins are stiff and carry a hint of stem. Give this some further bottle age, and drink it between 2018 and 2028."
Renwood,Barbera,90.0,100.0,1,"Fermented in neutral puncheons, this is a dense, rich and mouth-coating wine that ups the bar for Oregon Pinot Gris. The neutral wood aging expands the breadth and texture. There's a rich mix of apple, jicama and Bosc pear fruit, lightly touched with wood highlights, and finishing with a lick of buttery caramel."
Renwood,Red Blend,91.0,50.0,3,"This top-tier blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot shows lots of black rocks at first on the nose, and then black plum, lavender, cigar box and rose petals emerge with patience. It shows floral depth on the palate, with lavender and fennel enhancing the blackberry fruit, all wrapped together by minty earth tones."
Renwood,Syrah,88.0,25.0,1,"The first vintage for this re-branded, mid-level Ponzi Pinot is a doozy. Lovely aromatics offer a plush potpourri of plum, blueberry and cherry fruit, along with hints of curry, chocolate and hickory chips. Flavors are nicely entwined, round and full bodied, with a streak of root beer. This is ready to enjoy now and over the next couple of years."
Renwood,Zinfandel,90.48,46.12,33,"From one of the few Pinot Noir plantings in Paso, this wine is hearty on the nose, with black cherry, black plum, bay leaf, forest berry, balsamic reduction and a rugged earthiness. It's thick on the palate, where strong licorice spice meets with flavors of caramelized beef in a black-plum sauce."
Replica,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,14.0,1,"This must-have wine from the producer is always fun, a celebration of bright, juicy acidity and softly rendered dried lavender. Seamless on the palate, it will please fans of the variety and bring new ones into the fold, alluring in its smoky leather, white pepper and depth of blackberry."
Replica,Chardonnay,88.5,15.0,2,"Another of the producer's 100% varietal wines, this hails from a tiny site at the base of Spring Mountain. Juicy and delicious, it offers a mix of ripeness and savory complexity, with layers of soft, integrated cranberry, blueberry, cassis and sage, the acidity balanced and nicely uplifting."
Replica,Pinot Noir,84.0,16.0,1,"This bottling shows off more savory smoke than fresh fruit, with soy, black and white pepper and teriyaki/peppercorn-crusted beef aromas. The structure is surprisingly fresher and more clean, with lighter blueberry, pepper and more soy."
Replica,Red Blend,88.0,26.0,1,"This is a serious effort, with concentrated flavors of blackberry and cherry syrup. Syrah sometimes shows a substantial coffee streak, as it does here, along with a vanilla-soaked finish, amplified by aging 18 months in two thirds new French oak."
Respite,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,75.0,1,"Notes of hibiscus meet with red cherry, cola and cinnamon on this wine from a hilltop vineyard in the heart of the appellation. Intriguing chalky tannins frame the palate, where pomegranate and ripe cranberry flavors are leveled by a black-tea element."
Retro,Petite Sirah,91.0,45.0,1,"Made in the traditional method, this is a blend of base wines from the 2011 and 2014 vintages. The freshness of the recent vintage is annotated with mildly mature flavors from the earlier one, creating a delightful wine with rich flavors of lemon, lime, pink grapefruit and a touch of honey. The posh fruit says New World, but the overall elegance nods gracefully in the direction of France."
Reuling Vineyard,Pinot Noir,94.0,70.0,1,"The Legacy estate reserve is a limited selection from the original mid-1970s vines. Fruit flavors of blue plum and blackberry are shot through with a streak of chocolate, from aging in 18% new French oak. Elegant and persistent, this will drink well now through 2025."
Reustle,Grenache,84.5,27.0,2,"This hits the palate rather hard and green, with thin fruit that does not seem quite ripe. The barrel flavors add fat and caramel over the top, but remain unintegrated and seem out of place. The wine reverts to its green side as the tannins take over."
Reustle,Grüner Veltliner,89.75,28.5,8,"An uneasy mix of steel and butter, this may just need a bit more time to settle. At the moment, the twin elements of metal and popcorn clash and compete. For those who love the buttery style, this should prove pleasing."
Reustle,Pinot Noir,86.38,36.38,8,"Three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also has Sangiovese, Syrah and Merlot. The result is a pleasant, unfocused red wine, with candied flavors of berry and cherry, plus some tannic bite. Drink up."
Reustle,Red Blend,86.0,45.0,1,"This is a modest red wine, with very light berry-flavored fruit, and just a hint of cherry candy. The simple flavors are ready to drink."
Reustle,Riesling,88.0,21.0,2,"This is quite light, almost ephemeral, with tart raspberry and red licorice flavors and a strong metallic/mineral streak. It is delicately made, and interesting, but comparable to a simple Bourgogne rather than a wine priced at this level."
Reustle,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,22.67,3,"This aromatic wine has a strong floral scent that opens into more typical notes of tart lime skin and pineapple. It continues with similar palate impressions, then leaves a somewhat oily aftertaste, like a swallow of perfume."
Reustle,Syrah,85.86,38.43,7,"An open-book Cabernet medium in tannin structure and expressive in plum, blackberry and tobacco. Juicy with a rustic edge."
Reustle,Tempranillo,84.75,33.75,4,"A powerful Cabernet rich in black fruit, cinnamon and a backbone of mild tannin, Freakshow is robust and grippy, the finish showy in vanilla and smoky oak."
Reustle,Viognier,88.0,27.0,1,This is fashioned from a single clone and sourced from a single block of the estate vineyard. Peppery berry fruit is focused and concentrated. The length and overall precision and power suggest that further development in the bottle will continue to add complexity.
Revelry,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.5,20.0,2,"Green melon, lime peels and lime blossoms show on the nose of this racy wine from the historic regional producer. The green fruit flavors carry to the palate, where Granny Smith apples, green Anjou pear and lime juice mix with lemon peel and white rocks."
Revelry,Cabernet Franc,88.0,52.0,2,"The odd name (misspelled on the front label, correct on the back) means beyond the beyond. It's a lightly buttery, nutty take on a relatively simple, yet tasty Chardonnay, with mixed apple, tangerine and honeydew fruits."
Revelry,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,57.33,3,"Fully ripe, this opens with scents of hibiscus tea, mixed berry, plum and black cherry. The fruit flavors are bold and intense, right on the border of showing some prune character. Streaks of balsamic, tobacco and black olive make it a real potpourri. Drink up now through 2018."
Revelry,Merlot,89.0,40.0,1,"A spicy oak aroma, fresh red cherry and cranberry flavors and a brisk, slightly tannic texture make this wine quite appetizing. While medium bodied, it has plenty of flavor impact as well as an enticing mouthfeel."
Revelry,Red Blend,87.0,35.0,1,"Juicy, nearly sweet-smelling aromas of blackberry pie introduce this wine by master sommelier Paolo Barbieri, who moved from Las Vegas to become a winemaker in the Santa Ynez Valley a few years ago. The flavors are streamlined and fruit-forward with dark purple and red berries, as well as root beer and cola notes."
Revelry,Syrah,88.25,52.0,4,"Lots of raisins, prunes and heavy baking spice show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling, as well as hints of black pepper and shredded asphalt. Exotic figs and prunes also make an appearance on the palate, which is framed by a decent tannic grip."
Rex Hill,Chardonnay,90.57,48.29,7,"This shows light, tangy cranberry and raspberry flavors on the fresh, straightforward attack. Beyond that, it doesn't offer much detail, finishing with a touch of acidity."
Rex Hill,Pinot Gris,94.0,30.0,1,"The winery offers this bottling as a counterpart to their dry Riesling, but there's not much separation between the two. Its 10 g/L of residual sugar is certainly above threshhold, but with the searingly tart acidity underneath, it barely makes a dent. Citrus and apple flavors come through, but the sour lemon acidity is what dominates."
Rex Hill,Pinot Noir,90.86,55.14,37,"This full-bodied wine shows smooth and rounded plum fruit. The flavors are mouth-filling, but the rather quick fade suggests it's best consumed in the near term, as it's already five years past harvest."
Rex Hill,Rosé,90.5,24.0,2,"This wine shows grapey and plummy purple fruit notes lead to an earthy palate, with hints of stem and coffee. No new oak was used, but it spent 22 months in barrel prior to bottling."
Rexford,Merlot,90.0,35.0,2,"This wine opens with a rich nose of graham cracker and a concentrated midpalate, which becomes full bodied and toasty in oak. Around a gravelly texture are flavors of green olive, brine and baked pear, a mix of savory and sweet that finishes with a dash of nutmeg."
Rexford,Pinot Blanc,90.0,28.0,1,"Made in an understated classic style, this wine has a woody persistence of dried herb and mountain sage amid a grip of dusty tannin. Pencil shavings and red currant provide a yin and yang of structure and subtle character."
Rexford,Pinot Noir,93.5,40.5,2,"This vineyard site, like many others in Green Valley, was once planted to Gravenstein apples. That heritage persists in this wine's tartness that highlights an earthiness of sassafras, pomegranate and even citrus, bright elements atop a velvety-smooth texture."
Rexford,Tempranillo,92.0,28.0,1,"This wine opens with a touch of reductive qualities on the nose, allowing the oak to speak loudest. Soon, dark berry and cherry make their presence better felt, with the oak taking a lesser role and the soft, integrated tannins coating the palate in this light-bodied, unfussy effort."
Reyes,Pinot Grigio,83.0,22.0,1,"Elegant and lush aromas of black plum and boysenberry mesh with violets and lavender on the nose of this wine. Earthy tones of mace, cinnamon and crushed gravel enhance the bouquet, while wild berries pop on the palate. Flavors of bay leaf, coffee bean and more lavender ride atop the soft and polished tannins."
Reyes,Red Blend,86.0,22.0,1,"This is a shockingly good wine. The aromas draw you into the glass, with vibrant notes of capers and Kalamata olives, brine, smoke meat, mineral, black pepper and earth. The fruit and savory flavors—speckled by black and green olive notes throughout—show a compelling sense of texture and richness. It's a savory delight."
Reyes,Rosé,85.0,22.0,1,"This is a bright, engaging and vibrant 100% varietal wine, lovely in currant, cranberry and a sanguine earthiness. The acidity is weaved throughout and entirely supportive, uplifting the fruit to greater heights of freshness and focus."
Reyes,White Blend,80.0,30.0,1,"Juicy, wooded and herbal, this full-bodied wine is deliciously layered in plum, cherry and blackberry, well composed and sourced from a site in Yountville. The grippy texture is accented in dark chocolate that gives velvety lushness that lasts through the finish."
Reynoso,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,34.0,1,"From two of the most coveted sites in the appellation, this wine showcases an elegant ripeness and rapturous relationship to fruit. Dried sage and forest overtones complement concentrated flavors of fig, orange and dried cherry. It offers ample structure and is beautifully put together."
Reynoso,Syrah,88.0,36.0,1,"A rusty cherry and earthy forest-floor quality marks the energetic nose of this bottling, along with graphite and touches of chocolate and coffee. The sip boasts great verve, showing flavors of tart raspberry and well-integrated thyme, rosemary and pine-needle herbaceousness."
Reynvaan Family Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.67,73.33,3,"The first such bottling from the producer's 75-acre ranch on Westside Road, this impressive white is crisp in acidity with a fullness of body, both lengthy and complex. Apple skin, nutmeg, Bosc pear and a salty lilt combine effortlessly around a core of power and concentration that continues to evolve in the glass."
Reynvaan Family Vineyards,Syrah,92.65,76.76,17,"This wine is a blend from several of the producer's higher-elevation estate vineyards in the appellation. Floral and inviting in sugar apple, caramel crème brûlée and complex spice and salt seasonings, it's plush and voluptuous, with supportive acidity and a crushed stone minerality."
Reynvaan Family Vineyards,White Blend,92.0,40.0,1,"Velvety smooth, this wine seduces from the get-go, robust in black fruit, tea and delicate offerings of rose petal and lavender. Intensely full bodied, it retains a balance of bright, natural acidity that tames the spicy tannin."
Riaza,Graciano,86.0,28.0,1,"Coming from Upland and Boushey vineyards, this wine is 60% Grenache, 33% Mourvèdre and 7% Syrah. Expressive aromas of fresh blackberry, huckleberry, black pepper, smoked meat and herb are followed by penetratingly pure dark fruit flavors that are rich but still bring a sense of freshness. The purity is dazzling as is the length on the finish."
Riaza,Tempranillo,82.0,26.0,1,"This bottling by Josh Jensen shows sharp aromas of black plum and blackberry, with hints of lilacs. The palate combines a strong earthy quality with gravelly minerality, rose petals, lavender and dark cranberry fruit. Tannins are a bit rigid this early in this wine's life, so wait for the mellowing. Drink 2018–2034."
Riaza,Tempranillo Blend,85.0,29.0,2,"Sultry and inviting aromas of buttercream, custard and white peach are sliced by Meyer-lemon juice, salt and jasmine on the nose of this single-vineyard expression. It's finely tuned on the palate, delivering butterscotch and pecan flavors dissected by razor-sharp acidity and a chalky texture."
Riaza,Verdejo,85.0,19.0,1,"This grape is historically from southwest France but performs intriguingly in this bottling, with aromas of black cherry and sweet sage. The palate presents black olive, cooked cherries and plums, charred meats and decent tannins. There is not a ton of acidity, but it feels balanced nonetheless."
Ribbon Cliff,Red Blend,88.67,28.33,3,"A GSM blend of estate-grown fruit, this is delicate, brambly and shows light cherry-candy fruit flavors, benefitting from an elegant touch. There is a subtle hint of whipped cream and coconut as it winds down."
Ribbon Ridge,Pinot Noir,91.0,35.0,1,"Red dusty berry cobbler marks the entry to this estate wine co-fermented with 2% Petite Sirah. Milk chocolate, nutmeg and clove play supporting roles in this otherwise bright, food-friendly wine with measured oak impact."
Riboli,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,60.0,1,"Coming from the popular vineyard owned by the Chumash tribe, this delivers aromas of ripe raspberries and sanguine, earthy elements of iron-rich dirts. It's fairly mellow on the palate, with flavors of wild berry, lifting anise and a dank sense of tree roots."
Rideau,Chardonnay,91.0,42.0,1,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec offers classic peppercorn and big juicy cassis and blackberry notes. It's enjoyable now in its vibrant fruit forwardness but also structured enough to let sit 2018–2020. On the finish are touches of bittersweet chocolate and dried herb."
Rideau,Grenache,89.0,38.0,1,"This is an aromatically appealing estate Syrah with the Viognier (4% co-ferment) at the fore with notes of flowers and orange peel backed by Syrah's smoked meat, pepper, and earthy funk. The palate is light in body and flavor, not quite matching all of the intensity the aromas have to offer."
Rideau,Malbec,92.0,70.0,4,"The cool 2010 vintage seems to have taken a toll on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It's distinctly herbal with dry, astringent tannins and the fruit unable to stand up to the oak."
Rideau,Mourvèdre,92.0,42.0,1,"Fresh grapey, berry-like aromas and rich, ripe flavors make this medium-bodied wine easy to drink. It's smoothly textured and almost sweet, with generous fruit elements filling out the palate and persisting through the finish."
Rideau,Pinot Noir,92.8,47.6,5,"Aromas of flowers, green herb, pear and peach lead to silky sleek stone-fruit flavors. There's some interesting things going on but the fruit doesn't quite seem to have fully ripened."
Rideau,Red Blend,87.0,48.0,1,"Sharp acidity and intense oak meet in this deeply concentrated, tropically-influenced white. Peach, apple pie, and faint pineapple flavors all figure in."
Rideau,Rosé,88.0,28.0,1,"Simple red and black berry fruit defines this estate wine, along with its soft, ripe and lightly structured body. Vanilla and cranberry notes emerge on the midpalate, while the finish is marked by a grip of oaky tannin."
Rideau,Sangiovese,91.0,38.0,1,This rustic wine from a site just outside of Healdsburg offers a dense taste of grenadine liqueur and cola. It has moderate structure and plum and nutmeg accents.
Rideau,Syrah,89.0,48.0,4,"Sour plum, dried herb, pepper and tar scents show on the nose of this bottling from the widely available brand. The palate is tightly wound with sticky tannins, which are like to mellow with time, allowing the coffee, asphalt, elderberry and black currant flavors to shine more brightly."
Rideau,Viognier,88.67,45.67,3,"The oak (50% new French) plays a big part in this show, with aromas of coffee and pencil lead alongside the variety's strawberries and herbs. It's supple and pillowy in feel with a high yum factor."
Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,50.0,1,"In this distinctive, delicate, dry Riesling, the signature aromas of pine, petrol and white peach lead to crisp, tangy, green apple and peach skin flavors that tingle the taste buds. It's light bodied, lean in texture and makes the mouth water."
Ridge,Red Blend,92.0,38.0,1,"Aromas of vanilla bean, coconut and cocoa meld with cherry cola and dark fruit. The palate has tart, focused cranberry and cherry flavors with a restrained, velvety feel."
Ridge,Zinfandel,90.75,29.0,4,"Equal parts Dineen and Sheridan vineyard, this 100% varietal wine shows a mixture of dried and fresh herbs, savory notes, graphite and floral aromas. It's reserved and ultra-polished in feel with a divine sense of texture and plenty of tart acidity. Serve it at the dinner table to see it truly shine."
Rigg Estate Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,85.0,1,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec, this wine exudes complex aromas of leafy herbs, pencil lead, black licorice, citrus peel and dark cherries. On the palate, the blue and red fruit flavors are front and center, well framed by lively acidity and lick of tannins."
Righteous,Red Blend,86.0,12.0,1,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (67%), Merlot (22%) and Cabernet Franc draws you in with aromas of dark coffee, dried herbs, medicine cabinet and dark cherry. The sweet flavors are layered and tightly wound, with tart acidity and lightly gritty tannins stitching it all together."
Righteous,Sangiovese,86.0,20.0,1,"This blend of Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier displays aromas of almond, corn husk and apricot. There's a pleasing, nuanced feel to the sweet, full-bodied fruit flavors along with a finish that won't quit."
Righteous,Tempranillo,84.0,24.0,1,"This wine comes from some of the oldest vines in the valley, planted in 1977. Aromas of pear, hay and hazelnut lead to stone-fruit and butterscotch flavors that are light and elegant in style with a very pretty sense of balance."
Ripken,Graciano,85.0,25.0,1,"A new project from winemakers Mark McNeilly and Trey Busch, this wine leads with aromas of fresh green herbs, raspberries, dark chocolate and cherry. The palate is full bore but not overweighted, showing intensity to the red and black fruit flavors."
Ripken,Malbec,86.0,28.0,1,"Using dry-farmed grapes, Ryan Pease crafts a heavily structured wine with aromas of black gravel, mocha and blueberries reduced in a vanilla vinaigrette. The sticky tannins will need some time to unravel, but the flavors of cooked cherries, blackberries and coffee paste are promising. Drink 2018–2024."
Ripken,Primitivo,82.0,22.0,1,"This wine from an ownership team of former pro baseballers Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts is plush on the nose with dried strawberry, gingerbread and baking spices. The palate offers pomegranate-cherry juice along with graphite and coffee notes."
Rippey,Red Blend,86.0,20.0,1,"It's rare to see a varietal bottle of Chardonnay from this appellation. This one comes from Birch Creek Vineyard and has alluring aromas of lees, almond, peach and straw. The creamy stone-fruit flavors have a sense of richness but are also quite deft, with a finish that lingers."
River Road,Chardonnay,84.25,17.0,4,"Though it's a niche variety in the state, Carmenère has always been a flagship wine for this winery. This one is all varietal, with aromas of herbs, freshly cut green and jalapeño peppers. It coats the palate with dark fruit and savory flavors."
River Road,Pinot Gris,85.0,16.0,1,"This stylishly labeled wine by Adam Lazarre and Christian Tietje shows salted apples, lime blossoms and white flowers on the nose. The energetic palate offers just-cut green pears at first, then opens into a touch of vanilla. It tightens back down on green apple peels before ending with vanilla cream. The wine delivers a full experience."
River Road,Pinot Meunier,88.0,20.0,1,"A Southern Rhône-style blend, this wine shows aromas of cranberry, raspberry, fresh herbs and peppery spices. The flavors show purity, richness and restraint, with a finish that lingers."
River Road,Pinot Noir,88.5,22.0,2,"Light aromas of almond, fresh-cut red apple and spice lead to restrained fruit flavors. The concentration seems lacking."
River Road,Zinfandel,90.0,20.0,1,An unusual tawny color blends with deep pink in this wine that conveys cinnamon aromas and persimmon flavors. It's certainly an unusual style but has its own appeal.
River's Edge,Pinot Gris,85.0,12.0,1,"This wine has just enough residual sugar to take it to the upper threshhold of dry. It's quite full flavored with a thirst quenching mix of citrus, apple and pineapple. Crisp acidity enhances the freshness and contributes a tangy, lemony kick to the finish."
River's Edge,Pinot Noir,89.6,25.1,10,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (50%) and Franc (43%) finished off with Merlot. A blend of Stillwater Creek and Stonetree vineyards, it leads with fresh herb, game, black cherry and barrel-spice aromas. The flavors are more reserved than the aromas suggest, pulling up toward the finish."
RiverAerie,Red Blend,85.0,24.0,1,"A milky aroma, creamy texture and nice butter, peach and vanilla flavors add up to a rich taste for this big, soft, mouthfilling wine."
Riverbench,Chardonnay,91.33,30.0,6,"A percentage of Zinfandel plays nicely in this medium-bodied wine, aged almost two years in French oak. Spicy plum and vanilla surround supple tannin and a dry, lingering finish, accented in leather and black pepper."
Riverbench,Pinot Noir,91.31,44.15,13,Aromas of ripe red apple and pencil lead are followed by tart cherry and cranberry flavors. It's a unique interpretation of the variety.
Riverbench,Sparkling Blend,91.5,44.75,4,"Coming from the winery's vineyard just outside the Lake Chelan appellation, this wine is moderately aromatic with notes of lime, pear, flowers and diesel. It drinks off dry, with abundant stone-fruit flavors that linger."
Riverbend,Syrah,85.0,18.0,1,"Aromas of lees and spice edge out peach and pear notes. The palate is dry and creamy in feel, with the fruit flavors light and elegant. The lees influence dominates."
Riverhaven,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,34.0,1,"This unique blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Marsanne by Bob Lindquist is priced to sell. Fragrant Gravenstein apple, pink-grapefruit pith and a touch of honeysuckle show on the nose, followed by flavors of apple blossoms, lemon and lime zest on the light and easy palate that sizzles with a cider-like acidity."
Riverhaven,Syrah,90.0,28.0,1,"Coming from a cool vintage and one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine is starting to show some age, with evolved notes of dried fruit, mineral, licorice and baking spice. The cranberry, cherry and spice flavors show depth and intensity. Drink now."
Roadhouse Winery,Pinot Noir,89.0,57.83,12,This pale salmon-colored wine shows bright aromas of watermelon and strawberry. The palate drinks dry with mouthwateringly tart fruit flavors.
Roar,Chardonnay,91.0,45.0,1,"This cool-vintage wine offers aromas of vanilla, coconut, barrel spice, clove and red fruit. The palate is full of restrained cranberry flavors that show persistence."
Roar,Pinot Noir,94.5,56.0,4,"Aromas of smoke, vanilla, green herbs and spice are followed by generous cherry and barrel flavors. The wood juts out but it still brings enjoyment."
Roar,Syrah,91.0,40.0,1,"A very pretty pale salmon color, this wine is principally Grenache (64%) and Roussanne (23%) with the rest Counoise and Lemberger. Aromas of watermelon and rosewater are followed by just off-dry, mouthwatering citrus and cherry flavors that linger."
Roark Wine Co.,Pinot Noir,94.5,62.0,2,"Very well structured and richly textured, this is a serious red for a special occasion. It has a deep, smoky red color, slightly herbaceous and mineral aromas, generous cherry and raspberry flavors, full body and lots of fine tannins to give a soft bite on the palate. Made from 50% Tinta Roriz, 35% Carmenère, 15% Cabernet Franc."
Roark Wine Co.,Syrah,93.0,48.0,1,"A new wine by father-son team Tom and Rob Sinton, whose forebears partnered with Louis Martini during Prohibition. This blends in Merlot and Petit Verdot from a handful of vineyards, including Stagecoach and Konrad. It's herbal and peppery, exhibiting dark berry and coffee notes as well as soft, mellowed tannins."
Robert Biale,Petite Sirah,93.0,57.33,3,"Expertly integrated butter elements mix with peach and lime spritz on the nose. This single-vineyard Chardonnay offers stone fruit flavors, slight sea saltiness and a long vanilla finish for very easy drinking."
Robert Biale,Syrah-Petite Sirah,94.0,48.0,1,"Concentrated and generous in sweet red fruit, this is a gangbuster Oakville Merlot for the price. Balanced in fruit, herb and dry tannin, it's a lovable quaff from a well-known vineyard."
Robert Biale,Zinfandel,92.32,51.47,34,"Named after winemaker David Corey's son, this 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 3% Merlot begins with nose-tickling scents of berry syrup and smoked cigars. The maduro cigar flavor consumes the palate, with black cherry fruit and smooth tannins. It can stand up to a fat stogie or gamy meats like lamb."
Robert Craig,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,55.0,1,"Blueberry, sage and vanilla swirl into an admirable nose on this wine from a property far up the Santa Ynez River valley. There is distinct tar on the palate, like other wines from the property, with smashed black cherry fruit and tobacco herbaceousness present as well."
Robert Hall,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,50.0,1,"Big flavors and full body make this deep-colored Grenache stand out. It combines aromas of ripe raspberry and boysenberry jam with hints of tobacco and cedar in the flavors. All are supported by a firm, tannic texture that is rounded out by a sensation of richness."
Robert Hall,Orange Muscat,87.5,16.0,2,"The vineyard for this 100% Grenache is certified sustainable, organic and Biodynamic. Bright and light in strawberry and mint, the wine has a strong herbal component intertwined with tartness and tingling acidity."
Robert Hall,Port,90.0,36.0,1,"Full-bodied and lush on the palate, this exuberant wine offers a brightness of red raspberry fruit followed by acres of lively clove and ginger spice. High in acidity, it has years to go before it sleeps, the finish savory in leather."
Robert Hall,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,20.0,3,"This exotic and memorable white wine brings a floral, perfumed aroma, ripe fruit flavors and a nicely viscous texture. Rather light in body for its richness level, it delivers a lingering finish. It has the generous texture of a Chardonnay but with more intense fruit flavors."
Robert Hall,Rosé,86.67,14.0,3,"Honey is the key word to describe the nose and flavor of this extremely aromatic and just slightly sweet wine, which also offers notes of honeysuckle and honeydew. Winemakers often turn the grape Symphony (a cross of Muscat of Alexandria and Grenache Gris) into a sweet, dessert-style wine, but this shows how good it can be in a drier version."
Robert James Wines,Chardonnay,89.0,40.0,2,"This is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Syrah, with a core of blueberry and cocoa. It's super-smooth and quite easy to sip and enjoy. But apart from that, and the seductive coffee/mocha flavors that run rampant through the finish, it shows little of the depth and complexity that Washington Cabernet can display. Drink 2017–2019."
Robert James Wines,Pinot Noir,86.5,42.5,2,"Lively and full-bodied, the blend includes Chardonnay, Marsanne, Roussanne and Pinot Gris. Citrus fruits fill the mouth, with a streak of honey and appealing roundness. This is a great wine to just drink and enjoy, without too much contemplation."
Robert Karl,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.5,21.0,2,"There is a floral touch to the aroma and flavor of this bold, spicy wine. Along with toasted bread and smoke aromas, it has plenty of mouthwatering fruit flavor, firmly balanced by ample tannin and acidity."
Robert Karl,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.5,36.5,2,"Light aromas suggest peach and pear. The wine's flavors revolve around a slightly tannic and tart tension, between hard green apple skins and sharp mustard, making for a somewhat angular yet interesting spin on Chardonnay. Ample weight provides a solid mouthfeel, with a medium-length finish."
Robert Karl,Red Blend,90.5,34.0,2,"Lightly aromatic with notes of yellow apple, pear and melon. It drinks off dry, with the sugar seeming out of place but followed by an extended finish with clarifying acidity."
Robert Mondavi,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,11.0,1,"This very limited reserve is from a particular block, and as with most block selections, it offers focused, somewhat constrained flavors. Precisely defined red berry fruit is set in a frame of vanilla, toast and coffee. It's a pleasant, albeit generic quaffer."
Robert Mondavi,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.25,114.75,4,"This is a great wine for fans of the flashy, almost sweet, dark colored and fully oaked style of Zin. It has a tasty sense of maple syrup on waffles, boysenberries and vanilla. Full-bodied and concentrated, it's firm in texture and slightly sweet on the finish."
Robert Mondavi,Chardonnay,89.33,50.0,3,"From a great site in this cool appellation, this wine shines with a powerful grip of ripe cherry and strawberry fruit and earthy undertones of dried herb and cardamom cola. Layered and dense, it has a seductively smooth texture and bite of minerality."
Robert Mondavi,Fumé Blanc,91.17,37.0,6,"A good (not great) year for this cuvée, brings supple strawberry and cherry flavors, streaked with a strong taste of chicken stock. The wine is drinking okay, but re-tasting on the second day did not show the sort of development that promises a good long cellar life."
Robert Mondavi,Pinot Noir,88.2,55.2,5,"Balletto is making some fun, brightly crafted whites, like this floral, waxy one, that are not to be ignored amongst all its other estate offerings. Honey and white flower scents punctuate the nose before light, bright layers of lychee and orange flavors come through on the palate."
Robert O. Smasne,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,75.0,1,"There's no denying the concentration of this full-bodied, lavishly textured wine. It pulses with ripe blackberry and boysenberry from the aroma through the flavors and into the lingering finish. Delicious new American oak flavors lend complexity without overwhelming the taste of the grapes."
Robert O. Smasne,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,68.0,1,"From a three-acre block of the Valley View Vineyard just east of Solvang, this clonal selection shows cedar, black olive, black pepper and elderberry fruit on the tightly wound nose. Tart but ripe boysenberry fruit shows on the palate, spiced with peppercorn, more cedar and a slate-like minerality. Sticky tannins carry those flavors into the finish."
Robert O. Smasne,White Blend,90.0,38.0,1,"Ciel du Cheval, Klipsun, Obelisco and Quintessence make up this wine. The aromas of smoke, dark plum, cocoa, herb and spice lead to black-fruit flavors that show a sense of sophistication. There's no question it comes from a warm vintage and region but it shows a judicious touch."
Robert Ramsay,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,36.5,2,"Merlot (78%) takes the lead on this blend, with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon (14%), Cabernet Franc (6%) and Petit Verdot (2%). Fragrant aromas of green tea, flowery herb, barrel spice and cherry aromas are followed by concentrated, silky-soft red- and black-fruit flavors and exquisitely integrated tannins."
Robert Ramsay,Cinsault,88.5,32.0,2,"This almost delicate wine has wonderful light cherry and floral aromas, pure and vivid raspberry and red cherry flavors and a texture as smooth as silk. A rarity made from old vines, its medium body balances nicely with ample acidity, mild tannins and a lingering finish."
Robert Ramsay,Counoise,91.0,35.0,1,"Cloak & Dagger's film noir styling fits the dark and brooding character of this wine. Cola and graphite aromas mix with fresh blackberry and blueberry on the nose. The palate is well-structured with tangy, plum skin-like acidity while delivering satisfying dark chocolate, black olive and black cherry flavors."
Robert Ramsay,Grenache,88.5,38.5,2,"These quirky labels mark a stylish shift in Temecula, where traditional branding has long reigned, yet the wine is as solid as ever. This blend of 64% Petite Sirah, 13% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Franc, 7% Shiraz and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon shows dried black currant, turned loam, dark chocolate dust and dried mint aromas. The flavors are reminiscent of classic Old World bottlings, with cedar, dried herb and stewed plum laced with fresh acidity and a dry texture."
Robert Ramsay,Mourvèdre,89.0,35.0,4,"Plump Asian pear and sea salt aromas accompany lighter hints of butterscortch and marshmallow in this barrel blend from William Foley's estate in the heart of the Sta. Rita Hills. There is a textural pull to the palate, while Gala apple, sea salt and marzipan flavors provide richness."
Robert Ramsay,Red Blend,88.5,27.5,2,"Pale straw in color, this wine brings alluring aromas of toast, spice, clarified butter and stone fruit. The palate is full bodied with sweet, generous peach and tropical-fruit flavors that sail on the finish."
Robert Ramsay,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,35.0,2,"This winery's name is a nod to the adjacent Pleasant Valley Cemetery in San Miguel, where the warm climate suits Zinfandel well. Plump and bursting boysenberry and lingonberry aromas are dusted with vanilla and marjoram on the nose. The palate's flavors range from ripe red fruit to clove-driven spice and herbal touches, with pepper-laced acidity."
Robert Ramsay,Syrah,86.0,25.0,1,"This is a Cabernet-dominated Bordeaux blend from a variety of well-respected Yakima Valley vineyards. Despite a little sweatiness in the nose, the wine has some sleek, racy berry flavored fruit. It shows only moderate concentration in the midpalate, with juicy acids and firm tannins. The finish turns watery, a bit dilute, with raspberry and pale red currant notes."
Robert Renzoni,Chardonnay,90.0,28.0,2,"Six different varieties are included in the blend, which varies from year to year. This is very open and fruity, a good, all-purpose red blend that is ready to drink right now. The palate impression is almost too soft, with a residual flavor of ripe bananas running through the finish."
Robert Renzoni,Pinot Grigio,87.67,24.67,3,"Both sour and black cherry join with blackberry on this wine from Laetitia. It delivers a rich, full mouth, with a good tannic grip and lasting finish—perhaps in part due to the inclusion of stems in the fermentation process. Flavors approach the yellow-red blend of Mexican taco spices, equally savory and spicy."
Robert Renzoni,Red Blend,91.0,63.5,2,"An easy drinking, lightly colored wine, it offers bright red fruit, white pepper and a bit of green pepper on the nose. These are followed by cranberry, cherry and strawberry on the palate, bolstered by a pinch of green herbs. Often served slightly chilled, it's best served alongside Argentinian barbecue on the polo field—such as the Happy Canyon one owned by the brand's founder Thomas Barrack."
Robert Renzoni,Sangiovese,89.67,34.67,3,"Dark burgundy in color, it's crafted from estate-grown, organically certified grapes, a mix of Swan, Dijon 667 and 777 and Pommard clones. It has a dense, toasty character from 16 months in French oak, almost half of it new. A darker profile of baked plum and cinnamon swirls amid leathery earth. The finish is zingy and the wine is labeled as vegan."
Robert Renzoni,Syrah,89.0,28.0,1,"Chalk, cherry, crushed clove and nutmeg are all present on the nose from this 81% Cabernet Sauvignon / 19% Merlot from Paso Robles' Westside. It's juicy and vibrant once sipped, with deep red fruits and a blackberry finish. The wine isn't particularly complicated wine and there's isn't much tannic backbone for long cellaring, but it's tasty, approachable and easy-drinking now."
Robert Renzoni,White Blend,89.0,22.0,1,"Sourced from vines planted 45 years ago, this ripe and floral wine offers classically varietal scents of flowers, while flavors recall pear and peach. The length and detail are excellent."
Roberts & Rogers,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,75.0,2,"Sourced from Sagemoor Farms and the Homestead estate vineyard, this detailed and complex wine opens with pear and pineapple scents and flavors, then layers in pretty spices and toasty highlights."
Robinson Family Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,110.0,1,"This is old vine (1978), Wente clone Chardonnay, with bright, spicy fruit flavors of banana, pear and melon. A touch of toast and cracker comes from barrel-fermentation in neutral French oak. Forward and rich, this is one to drink up while it's young and fresh."
Roblar,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,40.0,1,"Sourced from the Blackrock Vineyard, production has quadrupled with no loss of quality. Pale copper, wonderfully aromatic, and showing the muscle and verve of the grape, this artfully melds scents and flavors of rose petals and peaches, with a touch of well-ripened tannin."
Roblar,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,85.0,30.0,1,"This is 100% Syrah from the Boushey vineyard. It's so compact that it's almost impenetrable, but the gorgeous aromas portend a glorious wine given appropriate bottle age and/or breathing time. A dark, dusty mix of black fruits, black olives, black coffee and licorice, this has such density that it's almost impossible to separate out all the fruit layers, let alone the earthier components that make it so distinctive. At 14.8% alcohol, this may be the biggest Betz Boushey Syrah ever."
Roblar,Chardonnay,89.67,46.67,3,"High toned, with deep cherry, strawberry and vanilla notes, this wine is velvety and dense, with powerful tannins and a breadth of earthy flavor."
Roblar,Pinot Noir,90.5,45.0,2,"Cola and soft red raspberry scents show on the nose of this blend of 58% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre, 17% Syrah. It's easy-drinking and simple, with red fruit, white pepper and asphalt hints. A great, light, quaffable red for a warm day."
Roblar,Red Blend,88.0,55.0,1,"High-toned aromas of herb, flower, spice and cherry are followed by tart elegantly styled fruit flavors. The new oak influence seems minimal. Pair it with food to see it at its best."
Roblar,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,25.0,2,"A dark core of black plum, blueberry and violet marks the nose of this single-vineyard bottling. The palate showcases purple fruit and floral notes, with concentrated black plum skin and more violet leading the way."
Rocca,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,160.0,1,"Earthy and leathery, this medium-bodied, ripe varietal wine dabbles in vanilla, blueberry and coffee cake aromas and flavors, finishing with a welcome softness."
Rocca,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,90.75,4,"Mellow and reserved at first, this clonal study shows wet river stone and key lime scents on the nose. The palate leads with slightly sour lemon and orange rind flavors, opening into a sweeter honeysuckle tone and finishing on ripe peach, melon and toasted nut."
Rocca,Red Blend,91.5,47.5,2,"This is one of the Fillippini family winery's best barrel blends, comprised of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Malbec, 10% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. The nose shows Concord grape, wisteria and black licorice aromas, while the palate doubles down on the licorice spice, with blueberry fruit, char and pepper in the background."
Roche,Chardonnay,88.0,34.67,3,"Aromas of barrel toast, kiwi and pineapple lead to a sweet, slightly lean, tropical-fruit-filled palate that delivers a lot of easy-drinking pleasure."
Rochioli,Chardonnay,93.4,60.6,5,"Half estate, half Pfeiffer Vineyard fruit, this is crisp and racy, with bright intense flavors of white peach and gooseberry. It's bracing, clean and thoroughly refreshing—great for a hot summer day."
Rochioli,Pinot Noir,93.14,76.57,7,"This is a screaming deal for such an admirably good wine, blended with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah and Syrah. Compressed black fruit meets fresh leather on the perfumed nose. The palate follows with thick tannins and mouthcoating flavors of licorice and cinnamon."
Rochioli,Sauvignon Blanc,90.67,35.0,3,"Though light in color, this flagrantly floral expression of the variety offers a crème brûlée-like richness on the nose. The palate is a different story—all tart fruit, lifted acidity and gravelly minerality."
Rock & Vine,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,17.0,1,"Wonderfully smooth and layered, this medium-bodied wine smells like fresh berries, tastes fruity and mildly spicy and feels silky in the mouth. The components are beautifully balanced, as fresh acidity lifts the fruitiness and mild tannins add a velvety touch."
Rock Lobster,Zinfandel,83.0,17.0,1,"From the seven-acre site surrounding the producer's farmhouse in the heart of the appellation, this wine is tart with red fruit and vibrant, spicy acidity. Perfumed rose petal notes fill the glass, revealing a silky texture as it opens."
Rock Point,Red Blend,84.0,10.0,1,"A tannic, brambly, earthy wine, this pure Red Mountain Syrah was kept in neutral oak and minimally racked. At first it shows a tart and chalky character; then there begins to emerge lovely concentrated black cherry and loganberry fruit, along with a backbone of ash, graphite and coffee. On the second day it has softened and expanded with an engaging mix of fruit, herb, pepper and Red Mountain rock."
Rock Point,White Blend,86.0,10.0,1,"This Syrah/Grenache/Mourvèdre blend, finished in screwcap, is always one of Washington's best values and flat out most delicious Rhône blends. The 2006 is the best ever, with dark, supple fruits that weave together berries, cherries, plums, cassis, licorice, pepper and Provençal herbs. It's a riot of flavors, young and brash, but perfectly capable of aging."
Rock Wall,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,40.0,1,"The blend here is 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Syrah, all from the Crawford vineyard. It carries some Port-like aromas of very ripe if not slightly over-ripe grapes, along with leafy components and accents of orange peel. A whiff of bourbon barrel sets up the sharp finish."
Rock Wall,Chardonnay,88.0,31.67,3,"Opaque in its deep purple color, this microchip-toting bottle fills the nose with the wet clay and menthol aromas. On the palate, graphite and black volcanic rock come with a touch of caramelized fruit and dark spices, such as black pepper, that take hold. Still rich with tannins, this will continue to emerge until 2024 if not longer."
Rock Wall,Grenache,87.0,25.0,1,"The power and richness of Port fill this extreme—and extremely delicious—Zinfandel. It is very deep in color and vivid in aroma, like the scent of ripe grapes at the crusher on harvest day. It fills the mouth with apparent sweetness that lingers long on the finish. Perfect match for after dinner with blue cheese and toasted walnuts, or a cigar."
Rock Wall,Merlot,86.0,75.0,2,"Lively and packed with fruit, this medium-bodied wine combines vivid cherry with more relaxed blackberry flavors on a gentle frame of light tannins and acidity."
Rock Wall,Montepulciano,86.0,25.0,2,"Juicy black currant and berry meet smoky oak and firm tannin in this approachably fruity, integrated effort from the appellation known best for its dust."
Rock Wall,Petite Sirah,90.0,28.0,1,"Intensely fruity and subtle in oak, this wine is smooth and juicy, with a pronounced sense of cherry and strawberry. Substantive tannin provides weight and breadth, along with a grippy, leathery finish."
Rock Wall,Pinot Noir,91.0,50.0,1,"Pale in color, this wine is aromatically quiet with notes of berry and herb, while the smoke notes emerge over time. The flavors are full and juicy but still bring a sense of delicacy, with a lingering finish. Give it time to open up."
Rock Wall,Red Blend,88.67,22.17,6,"Rustic aromas of crushed rocks and chewing tobacco pair interestingly with more floral elements of rose petal, lilac and wisteria on the nose of this bottling. Coffee and tobacco flavors show on the palate, where muddy tannins present leathery flavors of dark red cherries. It shows its long barrel aging with pride."
Rock Wall,Rosé,87.17,18.67,6,"This substantial wine is full bodied, robust in flavor and firmly textured due to ample fine-grained tannins. The fruit flavors are tempting and ripe, while accents of black pepper and dried herbs add complexity."
Rock Wall,Sparkling Blend,88.0,25.0,1,"Still settling into the bottle, this wine is aromatically quiet, with notes of white flowers and pear. It drinks off dry, with generous amounts of stone-fruit flavors. If the aromas blossom, it could move up a notch as the flavors are quite well proportioned."
Rock Wall,Tannat,90.0,25.0,1,"Barrel aromas of vanilla and mocha are at the fore, followed by blue fruit and blackberries. The palate displays a mixture of fruit and barrel flavors that linger through the finish."
Rock Wall,Teroldego,88.0,25.0,1,"Fresh red cherry and plump red currants are spiced up by Dr Pepper, cola, rose petals, mace and dried fennel on the nose of this bottling by Sabrine Rodems. Tea and Asian five-spice notes arise once sipped, backed by raspberries and pink peppercorns, altogether fairly light and lithe in body."
Rock Wall,Viognier,90.0,20.0,2,"This is an approachable, soft and relatively light-bodied version of the variety, tamed for present-day consumption and enjoyment. Chocolate-covered blueberries and maple syrup provide decadence, brightened by the presence of kirsch."
Rock Wall,White Blend,88.33,18.5,6,"This is impressively dark, with dense but grapy fruit flavors right out front. The mouthfeel is sharp and spicy, and it thins out surprisingly in the middle, given the color and rather high alcohol. Sappy acids and raspy tannins carry it through the finish."
Rock Wall,Zinfandel,88.52,38.48,21,"Roughly half Cab Franc, this includes Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo as well. Here the fruit is accented, not overtaken, with the flavors of barrels. The best of the winery's red wines, it augments its pretty cherry core with a streak of coffee and dark chocolate."
Rocky Hill,Red Blend,89.5,38.0,2,"A majority of Cabernet Sauvignon makes up this wine, blended with 14% Malbec, 14% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 2% Cabernet Franc. Thick and velvety with strong notes of dark chocolate, espresso and brambly blackberry, it has a juicy middle before finishing fairly flat."
Rocky Hill,White Blend,86.0,24.0,1,"This wine is delicious, rich and buttery, from the aroma through the flavors and on to the aftertaste. It smells like lightly toasted almonds and cream, tastes like toffee and pear juice, and finishes almost like dessert."
Rocky Point,Pinot Noir,89.2,65.0,5,"Light, bright and relatively low in oak, this wine otherwise shines in baked cinnamon apple and a complementary side note of vanilla. It finishes clean and lean."
Rocky Point,Rosé,83.0,35.0,1,"Add this bottling to the growing list of worthy Oregon Pinots under $20. Light and balanced, it offers spicy cranberry and rhubarb with a streak of red licorice. It's a good everyday wine for salmon and light poultry dishes."
Roco,Chardonnay,92.5,50.0,4,"This flavorful blend of Müller-Thurgau, Muscat and Riesling is lightly fizzy, and off dry, with residual sugar listed at 22.5g/L. Citrus fruits are limned with ginger, and it is a thoroughly refreshing and low-alcohol delight."
Roco,Pinot Noir,89.58,56.25,12,"Each new vintage tacks on another word for “yes”—this time in Swahili. Drink this one soon, as it's a ready-already mix of brambly, earthy, tart red fruits and scents of chamomile and herbal tea."
Roco,Sparkling Blend,91.0,65.0,1,"This vintage mixes fruit from Red Mountain and Alder Ridge (in the Horse Heaven Hills). Aromatic and soft, it's a five-grape Bordeaux-style blend, half Cabernet Sauvignon, and it carries that grape's herbal stamp. Tannins are a bit earthy, but the time in bottle has smoothed their rough edges. Drink up!"
Rodney Strong,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.7,65.0,10,"This delves into the more sanguine side of California's historic yet stylistically versatile grape, with rare meat and red earth aromas. On the tart palate is pomegranate and cranberry, with bay leaf and kalamata olives giving an herbal lift."
Rodney Strong,Chardonnay,90.25,29.25,4,"This fresh, leesy, almost creamy young Riesling is the first release from this new Walla Walla start-up. Gooseberry and lemon custard flavors compete for attention, and the texture and overall balance are good. It's finished dry, with just a touch of residual sugar to round off the edges."
Rodney Strong,Malbec,88.0,33.33,3,"Pure Merlot from the Red Willow vineyard, this does not skimp on the scents and flavors of green herb. It's true to the vineyard's style and will require further bottle age to flesh out a bit and show its best strengths."
Rodney Strong,Meritage,86.0,55.0,2,"This is a seriously huge wine, tightly wound in dry tannins, brooding dark fruit and savory pepper. Decant or give this robust black juice some time to resolve itself in the cellar, 2019–2024 or more."
Rodney Strong,Pinot Noir,90.0,30.0,5,"The Gamache brothers call this blend, which is half Cabernet Franc, one quarter Merlot, and the rest split between Malbec and Syrah, a happy accident—the result of having a shortage of Cabernet Sauvignon for blending. The Franc is a great base wine, a little rough and green, but packed with firm, cool-site red grape flavors. Aromatic and tasting of mixed fruits, it's blended just ahead of bottling, so the juice gets the same care as the pricier varietal wines."
Rodney Strong,Sauvignon Blanc,89.4,17.0,5,"A two-vintage blend of Cabernet Franc and Malbec, the Deep River Red has a roasted character that's dark and flavorful, with notes of cassis, coffee and cacao. It's full bodied and dense, with notes of graphite and pepper."
Rodney Strong,Syrah,94.0,30.0,1,"Chalky tannins override the deep, black-cherry flavor. Cassis and licorice streaks are also present, and there is no quibble with the concentration. Perhaps more bottle age will smooth out the chalky finish."
Rodney Strong,Zinfandel,89.33,22.67,3,"The Flash Point is a new name for the familiar Trio Reserve, which uses grapes that are sourced entirely from the Boushey Vineyard. Here the toasty oak barrel flavors dominate, while the fruit tends toward a light strawberry flavor, with more mocha than grape flavor."
Rodrigue Molyneaux,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,41.0,1,"This is a Petite Verdot-based blend, with smaller amounts of Zinfandel (22%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (14%), with opening scents of cherry and teak. It's clean albeit a tad heavy-handed, with soft tannins."
Rodrigue Molyneaux,Red Blend,87.5,27.0,2,"A meaty and oaky red blend of mostly Tempranillo (64%), with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, The Crusher sources grapes from a relatively cool area in Clarksburg. Fruity with cinnamon layers, this wine would pair well with hamburgers or pizza."
Roger Roessler,Pinot Noir,90.0,54.0,2,"Underripe raspberry, green-olive, dewy herbs, green-peppercorn and cardamom aromas show on the herbaceous nose. All of those elements are interwoven on the sip, where a core of fruit punch is laced by bay leaf, kalamata olive, bergamot and Christmas spice that persist deep into the finish."
Rombauer,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,86.67,6,"This winery is making one of the best cases for Pinot Noir in the Paso Robles area. This bottling, which is quite dark in color, starts with black plum, mulberry, wet loam and a strong sense of umami on the nose, with hints of nori and teriyaki. The palate shows tart black-plum-skin flavors alongside juniper and more moist, turned-earth flavors. The acidity is persistent and tannins firm enough."
Romililly,Zinfandel,88.0,45.0,2,"Baked strawberries and red cherries pair deliciously with shaved nutmeg, vanilla and black tea leaves on the nose of this bottling. There is a strong black plum tang to the sip, which is decorated lavishly with thyme, bay leaf, rust and gravel—a very elegant expression overall."
Ron Rubin,Pinot Blanc,91.0,30.0,1,"This is a very complete, well-balanced and satisfying wine that has a firm tannic structure to carry the tempting berry and black-cherry flavors. It starts with light cinnamon, clove and vanilla aromas that join loads of fruit on the palate, layering nicely for an interesting, complex and substantive character. Drink through 2025."
Ron Rubin,Pinot Noir,90.5,39.0,2,"Kudos to winemaker Doug Margerum for holding onto this extremely pleasing wine long enough for all the components to come together. Six years in, the aromas of cola, black cherry, rose petal, pepper dust and crushed gravel are still fresh and vibrant, while the palate remains upright due to structural tannins. Flavors of blackberry, raspberry and baking spice abound, making for an elegant wine."
Ron Rubin,Syrah,92.0,32.0,1,"This 100% varietal wine is the winery's inaugural Cabernet Sauvignon and hails from the Rocks District. It's boasts all of Cabernet's prototypical aromas, from black currant to tobacco and herb, with a kiss of vanilla from having aged in 50% new French oak. It's soft and palate-coating in mouthfeel yet retains a strong sense of structure, with lightly chewy tannins. A fine interpretation of the variety with a downright dazzling feel."
Roots,Pinot Noir,87.0,40.0,1,"Baked blackberry, vanilla, dust and chocolate show on the nose of this blend of 69% Petite Sirah, 22% Grenache and 9% Tannat. The palate is ripe with plum, blueberry and black currant and lifted by dried ginger and nutmeg, but the dazzling acidity and tannic firmness is what takes it to the next level."
Roots,Riesling,89.0,15.0,1,"Outstanding concentration rides an impressive structure in this huge but well-balanced wine. Freshly picked blackberries and raspberries meet hints of chocolate, baking spices and black pepper while vivid tannins and firm acidity lift up all those flavors and carry them to a lingering finish. Compelling to drink now, it's also built to age well. Best after 2020."
Rosa d'Oro,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,35.0,1,"There's a slightly gamy, pleasantly rustic touch to the nose of this hearty bottling, with a broad and deep boysenberry base spiced up by dark cola, nutmeg and wet gravel aromas. The mouthfeel is very full and the tannic structure is tight, propping up flavors of dark mulberry, tree bark and more roasted game."
Rosa d'Oro,Cabernet Franc,89.0,35.0,1,"Baked black cherry meets with nutmeg, clove and dried ginger on the very inviting nose of this bottling by Adam Lee. A sizzling acidity greets the palate, as do muscular tannins, with flavors of dark-red fruit, allspice and gingerbread falling into place."
Rosa d'Oro,Muscat,90.0,16.0,1,"There are expected aromas of ripe blueberry, purple flowers, peppercorns and burnt bacon on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard in the Sta. Rita Hills, but Joey Tensley also packs in quite a bit of herbs, with bay leaf and dried chaparral. Tightly wound flavors of dark purple fruit, beef char and coarsely ground black pepper show on the tarry sip."
Rosa d'Oro,Red Blend,88.5,27.5,2,"This giant of a wine has aromas of charred oak, wood smoke and black pepper, with a palate of dense, deep and smoky tones that feel thick, tannic and chewy. It's a tour de force of spicy oak, fruit concentration and mouthcoating texture that's impressive to drink now but will be best after 2024."
Rosa d'Oro,White Blend,87.0,16.0,1,"A superdark color and effusive aromas of wood smoke, raisin and dried fig set the stage for extremely concentrated, ripe fruit on the palate and a thickly tannic texture. The exuberance of the grape and blackberry flavors nicely counterbalances the firm texture. This will age well, so best to drink it after 2020."
Rose & Son,Red Blend,87.0,29.0,1,"There's a sultry aromatic combination of stewed strawberry and bright raspberry as well as subtle thyme, tarragon, rosewater and French toast on the nose of this bottling from the iconic vineyard. The baked red fruits and hard woody spices are cut by pungent acidity and firm tannins on the sip. Hold off a bit on this one, but then enjoy for decades. Drink 2019–2034."
Rosenblum,Petite Sirah,86.0,18.0,1,"This cuvée is 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay, and the nose leaps out with vanilla wafer, yeast and toasted nuts. It has the extra fruit power of domestic bubbly, and lacks the finesse of real Champagne. Yeasty and round, it finishes a bit short with a hint of plastic. But at this price point it's a wine to savor, that brings a lot of enjoyment to the table."
Rosenblum,Zinfandel,89.83,32.17,12,"Soft and approachable, this seems more like a generic red than a pure Cabernet Sauvignon. It's quite ripe, ready to drink, and certainly smooth. What is not there is any particular varietal character or sense of place. This is a medium-bodied red that could be from anywhere."
Ross Andrew,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.83,15.5,6,"This is quite light and lemony, closer to an Italian Pinot Grigio than to an Oregon Pinot Gris. What it lacks in flesh it compensates for in freshness and vitality; the subtle fruit flavors suggest Asian pear, jicama and cucumber. It would be a lovely match for a light fish such as rainbow trout or Dover sole."
Ross Andrew,Pinot Gris,88.5,20.5,2,"This edition of the Spinner is 50% Merlot, 37% Syrah and 13% Malbec. It's scented with leaf and raisin, streaked with smoke and baking spices, and offers up a medium-bodied midpalate with a mix of black cherry, currants and pomegranate. Fine for near-term drinking."
Ross Andrew,Pinot Noir,90.33,39.0,3,"The oak (85% new French) is at the fore on this wine. Aromas and flavors of coffee, butterscotch and woodspice head out in front of dark fruit that doesn't have the heft to match it."
Ross Andrew,Rosé,88.0,18.0,2,"This is a perfumed wine with aromas of fresh flowers, orange peel and citrus. It drinks dry with a broad, fleshy feel, falling a bit flat on the finish."
Ross Andrew,Syrah,90.8,47.2,5,"Racy, this stainless-steel fermented white is fuzzy in gooseberry and pineapple, not quite veering into fresh-cut grass, but staying more tropical and generous in ripe fruit. A dry, lemony finish provides refreshment."
Roth,Red Blend,89.0,30.0,4,"Fresh, clean and rather soft in balance, this shows easy-to-like aromas of pear and apple, slightly sweet flavors of honey and pear juice, and an almost syrupy, soft mouthfeel. It's agreeable and sweet."
Rotta,Red Blend,91.0,45.0,1,"This is the first reserve for this unassuming, low-profile winery whose wines clearly belong in the first rank of Washington's boutiques. It shows classic Cabernet fruit from three top vineyards, long and persistent, yet never over extracted or alcoholic. True Bordeaux style in an elegant, ageworthy wine. Editors' Choice."
Rotta,Zinfandel,92.0,40.0,2,"Here is what all the excitement is about:  a Washington Syrah bursting with dense, thick, textured, rich, ripe fruit, yet not too “jammy.” The acids are there to support all that weight, along with generous amounts of oak. The zippy, berry-laden fruit shines through, then the oak kicks in with an abundance of smoke, coffee and licorice notes. Big, sappy, sensuous and flat-out sensational wine. Editors' Choice."
Round Pond,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,80.0,1,"This is an elegant, textured, subtle wine that will reward cellaring. Very fragrant and stylish, it shows smoky, dusty black cherry and cassis scents, ripe but not raisiny fruit, tightly wound and revealing hints of earth and mineral. Some sweet cocoa adds interest to the finish. Cellar-candidate 6-10 years."
Round Pond,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,110.0,1,"In this new vintage there is a bit more Sauvignon Blanc (69%) than usual; the rest is Sémillon. Rich, oaky and expansive, it is an oak and texture-driven style, with the fruit—clean, slightly herbaceous, spicy and tart—playing second fiddle. Which is no criticism, because the delicious, over-the-top flavors, with layer upon layer of creamy complexity, and the rich, buttery finish just beg for lobster in a cream or butter sauce. Who can argue with that? Editors' Choice."
Round Pond,Nebbiolo,90.0,24.0,1,"Excellent fruit shines forth in this estate-grown Cabernet from the winery's Horse Heaven Hills vineyards. Flavors of mixed berry, black cherry and cassis carry a proper hint of fresh herb. Notations of licorice, earth and dark chocolate add depth and complexity to the elegant finish."
Round Pond,Red Blend,90.0,80.0,1,"The Ulysses red has been the main calling card for this winery, and it is a distinctive wine that expresses the complexity—with no herbs barred—of Yakima Valley grapes. Woven into the heart of the wine are threads of herb, olive, pea vine and other green notes, but there are also black cherry and cassis flavors. It's balanced and proportionate, closer to a true Bordeaux-style blend than most Washington efforts."
Round Pond,Sauvignon Blanc,90.67,30.0,3,"This is an especially fine version of this single-vineyard Cabernet Franc; sadly, it may be awhile before we see it again as the vineyard suffered severe damage in 2011. Loaded with pure, rich cherry fruit, it adds layers of graphite, cedar and coffee over a mineral base."
Round Pond,White Blend,89.0,38.0,1,"This wine has a deep-gold color, attractive baking-spice and buttered popcorn aromas, appealing apple and pear flavors and medium body. The texture is soft and easy and the acidity tastes low."
RouteStock,Chardonnay,89.0,16.0,1,"Freshly cut pear and tropical aromas lead to medium-bodied flavors. The style is clean and well made, with the concentration dipping a bit at times."
RouteStock,Pinot Noir,87.0,20.0,3,"White wines are extremely rare in this blazing-hot appellation. This off-dry example brings aromas and flavors of dried pears and apples, with the sugar writing much of the story."
Row Eleven,Pinot Noir,87.0,24.0,4,Reductive aromas take the lead and distract from the notes of apple and citrus. It drinks off dry with an elegant styling.
Rowland,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,125.0,1,"The nose of this light-colored wine offers showy apple blossom and pineapple aromas, leaning into the ripe and tropical side of the grape spectrum. it delivers crisp energy once sipped, with very fruit-forward apple flavors and even a touch of guava."
RoxyAnn,Red Blend,88.0,21.75,4,"Big and bold in body, earthy in aroma and showing ample fruit flavors, this assertive and high-alcohol wine packs quite a punch in texture, too. The impact of lots of tannin is apparent in the astringency."
Roza Ridge,Red Blend,85.0,15.5,2,"Juicy in blackberry and cassis, with a strong Bordeaux-varietal rush of peppercorn and herb, this wine leans green and tight on the palate, aiming for a classical style from a cool year and cool region."
Rubino Estates Winery,Barbera,87.0,28.0,1,"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Petite Sirah from the Warner Springs area southeast of Temecula shows lots of promise for this producer. Smoky berries, uncrushed black peppercorns and a bit of asphalt show on the nose, with juicy, plump red fruits benefitting from lots of cardamom, allspice and other black spices on the palate."
Rubino Estates Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,28.0,2,"This robustly generous wine is impactful in chocolate and sweet, soft plum. A complexity of cedar, herb and blackberry marks the palate, with integrated tannins and oak. The complementary elements provide intrigue and flavor in a heavyweight package, ready for cellaring through 2022."
Rubino Estates Winery,Chardonnay,92.0,24.0,1,"Earthy times 10, this unfined, unfiltered wine is subtle and splendid, a study in spiced pomegranate and cola, with a medium build and long finish. Intriguing from start to end, it remains light and vibrant in acidity in the glass, and is a fine example of restraint that doesn't lose flavor."
Rubino Estates Winery,Red Blend,89.33,31.67,3,"This delightful and refreshing wine is atypical in all the right ways. Intensely aromatic, it conveys a lush mix of honeysuckle, sweet hay, smoke, lime and honeydew melon. And that's before you take the first sip. The low alcohol and bright acidity set it up for a wide range of poultry, pasta and seafood options, and anything with goat cheese is sure-fire."
Rubino Estates Winery,Sangiovese,89.75,31.0,4,"Very fragrant in the glass with ripe blackberry syrup, purple lilacs, root beer, chopped mint and sharp cola notes on the nose, this blend of 57% Dolcetto, 35% Refosco and 8% Nebbiolo is a nod to the family's Italian heritage. It's rather light and vibrant on the dynamic and unique palate, with purple fruits, tobacco leaf, slate and black-pepper flavors."
Rubus,Zinfandel,87.5,19.0,2,"Certified Biodynamic and all estate grown, this five-clone blend is barrel fermented with indigenous yeasts, and bottled unfiltered and unfined. It offers a mouthwatering mix of apple butter, caramel and toast. The length and subtle details argue for further aging, but go ahead and drink it now."
Ruby,Pinot Noir,90.5,50.5,2,"This self-described, entry-level blend boasts floral aromatics and spicy, peppery fruit flavors of cranberry, strawberry and raspberry. Ribbon Ridge Pinots show great character, especially when from estate-grown, biodynamically-certified grapes like this offering."
Ruby Hill Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.33,53.33,3,"Strong aromas of blueberry paste, cracked peppercorns and concentrated lilacs prepare the nose for a powerful sipper. The palate falls in line, proving rich and full, with flavors of stewed blackberries, plums, a bit of licorice and an herbal twist between dried mint and dill."
Ruby Hill Winery,Chardonnay,91.8,31.2,5,"Aromas of strawberries and olallieberries seasoned with mace, allspice and savory woods greet the nose on this blend of Syrah and Grenache by Mark Chesebro, former winemaker for Bernardus. The palate shows black cherry, cedar and tobacco, proving quite flavorful, structured by sticky tannins and a striking acidity."
Ruby Hill Winery,Petite Sirah,92.5,34.25,4,"From an extreme-coastal vineyard near Cambria, this shows lots of low-alcohol, low-ripeness qualities on the nose: Kalamata olive, sautéed brown mushrooms, wet asphalt and just the slightest hint of raspberry and cranberry. There is tons of tingly acidity on the palate, along with flavors of tobacco, marjoram, dewy oregano and barely ripe cherry tomato. Drink 2020–2030."
Ruby Hill Winery,Red Blend,88.0,15.0,1,"This wine's thick and buttery aromas range from cashew cream and caramel to honeysuckle and Maui onion. Its powerful acidity cuts through the palate's unctuous and oily qualities, with buttercream and lemon juice flavors combining for a big personality."
Ruby Hill Winery,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,19.0,1,"Smoky bark and cola notes are cradled in reductive oak in this robust wine from a fantastically farmed site. Its dark berry flavor is supported by velvety tannin and juicy acidity, both of which provide moderate structure."
Ruby Hill Winery,Zinfandel,89.75,37.75,4,"Perfumed with rose and lavender, this wine has robust tannins and dominant oak notes, both in support of its ripe, concentrated red fruit. Woody, herbal components complement the lushness, framed by gravelly texture."
Rudius,Syrah,91.0,58.0,2,"This is 100% Pommard clone, bright and spicy in the nose. The fruit flavors are sharp and penetrating, with brambly berries and a touch of pine sap."
Rulo,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,90.0,25.0,1,"With initial weightiness and fullness on the palate, this wine ultimately delivers crisp, cool peach and melon flavors, a lingering lemon zest note adding to its freshness."
Rulo,Chardonnay,91.67,20.0,3,"From the warm appellation, this wine offers moderate structure and undeniable ripeness—a deep, brooding expression of dark chocolate, plum and leather."
Rulo,Red Blend,88.0,18.0,1,"This fresh young wine has a pleasing leesy character upon being poured. With extra breathing time it fills out, adding details of citrus pith and skin to clean green apple, melon and cucumber flavors."
Rulo,Syrah,93.0,30.0,1,"This is a bright, effusive, full-bodied wine, with underlying acidity that keeps it fresh in the glass. Apple and pear flavors combine with firm texture, providing weight and breadth."
Rusack,Chardonnay,92.0,42.67,3,"This new offering from the sparkling wine producer reveals strongly crafted layers of creamy apple pie, crème brûlée and toasty oak flavors. Made in a full-bodied, concentrated style, it doesn't hold back on its spicy acidity and lemony finish."
Rusack,Pinot Noir,91.62,52.75,8,"Well-integrated blueberry and purple flower aromas make for a casual rather than bombastic nose in this blend of 32% Syrah, 28% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre and 15% Petite Sirah. Roasted meat, charred blackberry and dried fennel notes show on the palate, feeling very balanced and acid-even."
Rusack,Syrah,91.5,37.25,4,"This high-wire wine skirts along tart red fruits with a stiff herbal spine. Sourced from Lange Estate, Freedom Hill and Yamhill vineyards, it was aged in 40% new French oak. A nice streak of espresso, licorice and char completes the finish."
Rusack,Zinfandel,89.75,58.5,4,"This is much creamier, with much more leesy flavor than the regular bottling, but not as much ripe fruit (perhaps because it is from a different vintage). Various flavors of nuts, honey, spice and light tropical fruit mingle in a well balanced finish."
Russian Ridge,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,32.0,1,"This might be one of Oregon's best Cabernet efforts to date. Yes, it's firm, with hard tannins, but time should allow that to settle down. In the meantime, there's char, road tar and caramel on the nose, while plum, cassis and chocolate dominate the rich, extracted palate. Toward the end it's the tannic structure that makes itself most felt. But again, some time in the cellar is probably all it requires."
Russian Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,34.0,1,"Atypically ripe, weighty and intense for a Finger Lakes wine, with pear and peach notes buttressed by minerally dry extract. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous and the alcohol level a relatively high 13.1%, but it finishes long and elegantly, with tongue-tingling acids."
RustRidge,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,50.0,1,"Southern Oregon, unlike the northern Willamette Valley, is warm and conducive to growing Bordeaux varieties, as evidenced by this hearty, tannic blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Right away you get kirsch and cassis from this heavyweight, and that's followed by a ripe palate that blasts loudly with plum and chocolate. Along the way there are some drying tannins and pulsating acids, so either lay it down for a couple of years or decant and serve with grilled meats."
RustRidge,Chardonnay,87.0,43.0,1,"This is a Bordeaux-style blend, 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cabernet Franc and Merlot filling it out. All the fruit comes from the Stillwater Creek Vineyard. The initial aromas are dominated with sweet, toasty, pretty new French oak, with the irresistible flavors of mocha following. As good as it is, the fruit seems light and submerged, with little depth. This is a wine to enjoy in its youth."
RustRidge,Zinfandel,86.0,35.0,1,"Direct and appealing with notes of dried herbs, cherry, and toast. It's broad in feel with good depth and structure with dry tannins the only thing holding it back."
Rutherford Grove,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.4,59.0,5,"A very pretty expression of Cabernet Franc with notes of cherry, chocolate and floral notes. It's elegant in style with a textured, satiny mouthfeel and a tart, lingering finish."
Rutherford Hill,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.33,35.0,3,"Classic, elegant Pinot Noir aromas introduce this delightful wine. Whiffs of flowers, citrus and fresh herbs accompany a tart, pretty palate with nuanced rhubarb, cranberry and raspberry flavors."
Rutherford Hill,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,60.0,1,"McCay's Westside Zin, Trulux, opens with a strong bouquet of red and black fruit along with a suggestion of anise. Inviting, it's structured and smooth in tannins, with a bite of oak on the finish. Earthy and with great acidity throughout, it makes for a great food wine."
Rutherford Hill,Chardonnay,87.5,22.5,2,"Low-yielding vines cropped down to 1.5 tons/acre contribute to the length and power of this tart, lip-smacking Pinot Gris. There's a delicious mineral underpinning to the subtle flavor mix of Asian pear, apple and lemon. A nice hint of tarragon also comes into focus."
Rutherford Hill,Red Blend,86.0,35.0,2,"This is a fine expression of old-vine fruit, with raspberry and cherry along with juicy highlights of pineapple and grapefruit. Tannins are a bit stiff right out of the bottle, so an hour or two of aeration is in order, or tuck it away until 2020–2022."
Rutherford Ranch,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,42.0,1,"High-toned herb aromas mix with barrel spice, pencil lead and blackberry notes on this initially aromatically brooding wine. The palate holds nothing back with rich, intense black-fruit flavors that display a ripe style. It's a bit hard to get at the variety but the yum factor is there."
Rutherford Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,52.0,1,"This is an aromatic wine, with notes of blackberry, braised meat, Kalamata olive, iron and French-oak spices. The palate holds nothing back, with bold, rich fruit flavors that coat the palate, showing warmth on the finish. Although the oak seems prominent it still provides enjoyment."
Rutherford Ranch,Chardonnay,85.5,33.5,2,"Cabernet Sauvignon (71%) is in the lead here followed by Merlot (24%) and Cabernet Franc. Brooding aromas of herb, smoke, cherry and spice are followed by an elegantly styled palate. Lightly crunchy tannins and tart acids provide support. It's a very pretty expression of this esteemed vineyard."
Rutherford Ranch,Red Blend,86.33,25.0,3,"A steely mix of raspberries and cherries frames the core fruit with tart citrus. There's a hint of gunmetal, along with tight well-ripened tannins. Solid winemaking all around."
Ryan Cochrane,Chardonnay,93.75,34.5,4,"This reserve bottling, done entirely in stainless, brings extra weight and depth, with an enticing floral top note. Oranges and citrus-peel aromas carry into the palate, and a sense of powdered sugar suggests that perhaps it wasn't fermented completely dry. In any event, it's complex, compact and commanding."
Ryan Cochrane,Pinot Noir,92.14,43.86,7,"This 100% varietal wine hails from a site east of Cloverdale, in a warm pocket reaching up to 1,030-feet in elevation. It offers a full-bodied concentration of black cherry, raspberry and clove flavor, with a smooth texture and mild, toasty oak. Chocolate mocha marks the finish."
Ryan Patrick,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,20.0,1,"This fine new offering is whimsically packaged with a screw cap and a floral label. That spirit is further evidenced by the wine's pretty pink color and subdued, light building of flavor, highlighted by orange, peach and strawberry notes and a substantial bite of mouthwatering acidity."
Ryan Patrick,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,41.25,4,"This wine comes from three-year-old vines at this esteemed vineyard. Lighter in color, it has aromas that pop and are very primary, with notes of boysenberry, raspberry and herb. Lighter in style, the flavors are pure and direct, showing no new oak influence (neutral barrels for four months) and an appealing feel. The purity is dazzling. It impresses on its own but is meant to be shown at the dinner table."
Ryan Patrick,Chardonnay,88.4,16.8,10,"This blend of 47% Grenache, 39% Syrah and 23% Mourvèdre packs dense fruit on the nose, showing plump blackberry and black plum, with touches of pepper, tar and charred beef. The palate is dry and leads with savory peppercorn and asphalt notes, then rounds out with blueberry and dried herb flavors, all balanced by spry acidity."
Ryan Patrick,Grenache,88.0,35.0,1,"Quite dark in the glass, this blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot and 4% Merlot starts with snappy boysenberry aromas and grows more savory with dust and dried pine needle notes. The palate's acidity is expertly integrated, carrying charred blueberry, minty dill and cocoa flavors."
Ryan Patrick,Red Blend,88.67,20.0,6,"This wine is a blend of Syrah (44.5%), Grenache (33.3%) and Mourvèdre. The aromas are light and nuanced, with notes of raspberry, thistle, flower petal and herb. The red- and black-fruit flavors bring a pleasing sense of purity and freshness that carries through the finish."
Ryan Patrick,Riesling,88.33,10.67,3,"This brooding, brawny wine made from mountain fruit is all about mushroom and compost notes—a true expression of the vineyard's surroundings. Black cherry fruit and youthful tannins provide context, with a sizzling streak of acidity."
Ryan Patrick,Syrah,90.0,40.0,1,"Gamy roast lamb aromas meet blueberry and crushed bay leaf on the nose of this bottling—a shining example of Syrah from southern Santa Clara County. White pepper, thyme and graphite notes show on the palate, where a core of elderberry fruit core is enhanced by that feral, gamy quality."
Résonance,Chardonnay,95.0,50.0,1,"As salty as preserved lemon brine, this wine is medium-bodied, with integrated oak, having aged in 33% new French barrels. Golden delicious apple and a spicy bite of quince round out the subtle fruit flavors, bolstered by gravelly texture."
Résonance,Pinot Noir,92.0,65.0,1,"Coming in an oddly shaped, squat bottle reminiscent of the Wild West, this unfiltered wine bursts with blackberry, purple flowers and turned loam aromas. On the palate, deep black currant fruit is accented with peppery spice, graphite and a sizzling acidity that burns from the tip to the back of the sip."
Rôtie Cellars,Grenache,93.0,65.0,1,"The latest release of the H3 Chardonnay shows plenty of fruit upfront (20% was fermented in stainless steel). Firm, crisp apple and a buttery finish set this clearly in the mainstream Columbia Crest style."
Rôtie Cellars,Marsanne,89.0,32.0,1,"Creamy brie rind aromas mesh with scratched yellow grapefruit skin and a steely minerality on the nose of this small-batch bottling from a winery atop the appellation's ridgeline. Light and focused flavors of kumquat juice, iodine and lime skin satisfy the palate, and would be a perfect match for shellfish."
Rôtie Cellars,Red Blend,90.5,35.0,2,"Voluptuously tropical in shaved coconut and silky layers of peach and pear, this is a complex, age-worthy white from a stellar vineyard site, a knockout version of the variety. Smooth and round, it maintains a core of acidity that buoys the experience, finishing with a flourish. Drink now through 2022."
Rôtie Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.71,44.57,7,"Grapes from this tiny AVA frequently deliver that something extra that catapults Pinot into a higher dimension. Here, solid cherry and berry tones bear almost indefinable traces of iron, mineral and sweet hay. Delicious already, this should continue to improve through 2020."
Rôtie Cellars,Rhône-style White Blend,89.0,30.86,7,"Produced cryogenically, this sweet dessert wine is made with estate-grown fruit. A floral nose is rich with scents of orange blossoms, while in the mouth it coats the palate with flavors of lemon drops, candied papaya and dried mango fruits. The concentration and balance are superb, with more than enough acidity to counterbalance the sugar. Drink now through 2030."
Rôtie Cellars,Syrah,93.33,45.33,3,"Coming from a block of vines called South Pointe that are planted closest to the vineyard's creek, this wine shows plum and raspberry fruits on the nose along with smoked licorice and black slate. It's ripe in raspberry flavor at the tip of the sip, but then clings to a restrained line of graphite and peppery, acidic spice, continuing to evolve deep into the finish."
S&G; Estate,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,90.5,85.0,2,"Caramelized oak and vanilla make for a thick, rich and buttery experience in this bold, but balanced wine. Juicy and tempered, it exudes passionfruit and lime in abundance, with a seasoning of fennel and dried herb. Drink now through 2020."
SOLID,Red Blend,90.0,25.0,1,"A 100% varietal wine entirely from the producer's Napa side of its property, this special cuvée is thick and rich in black and blue fruit, generously soft and silky on the palate with well-integrated oak. Complex and built to age, it finishes in a jolt of black pepper and licorice. Enjoy now through 2022."
Sabina Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,125.0,1,"From one of the Napa Valley's most historically famous sites, this Cab delivers a testament to gamy blackberry and blueberry alongside complex cassis, clove and black licorice. Full bodied and richly concentrated, it's also soft and well integrated, entirely pleasurable now, with years to go in terms of structure and body. Cellar through 2027 and possibly beyond."
Saddleback,Chardonnay,91.0,29.0,1,"Bryan Babcock sources from the Buona Terra Vineyard for this bottling that shows intensely focused aromas of candied pomegranate, cola, anise seed and dew on sweet sagebrush. It's rich and soft on the palate, yet lively with intense herbal energy and grippy tension, all laid across the juice of ripe red berries."
Saddleback,Zinfandel,86.0,42.0,1,"Lavender and other purple flowers meld with graphite, concentrated strawberries and dried raspberries on this wine from a cherished block on a historic vineyard. It's snappy on the palate, with sharp pomegranate fruit and tongue-tingling acidity. A tad of brie, watermelon and shiitake mushroom pop up toward the finish."
Sagelands,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,16.0,1,"Crisp and crunchy red fruit like cranberry surround a tight, grippy structure seasoned well in cola and Asian spice. Full bodied, the wine is textured and elegant, robust without being overbearing, a standout for the producer and the appellation in a picture-perfect vintage year, sourced from both the Wayfarer and Hallberg vineyards. Drink now through 2023."
Sagelands,Merlot,86.0,15.0,1,"Rich red cherries, raspberries, red currants, concentrated rose petals and hibiscus are cut with an edge of eucalyptus oil, chipped slate and purple sage on this stellar bottling from this producer's 25th vintage. Dark fruits of blueberry, blackberry and black cherry emerge across a deeply layered palate, which is boosted by violet and lavender florality."
Sagelands,Red Blend,87.0,10.0,2,"Buoyant aromas like apricot and white peach lead to rich, sweet, appealing flavors like pistachio and peach and a smooth, mouth-filling texture. It will make a great pre-dinner wine for people who don't drink dry, and also a good pairing with cheese."
Saggi,Red Blend,90.0,45.0,1,"Varietally funky, light in color and straightforward in approach, this still-young wine has structured tannins that persist on the palate, nearly chewy but starting to find their groove. Orange and cinnamon are dominant characteristics."
Saint Helena Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,75.0,1,"Layered aromas of dried rose petals and violets meet with peppery strawberry and plum fruit, proving relatively light with crushed-rock minerality on the nose. The palate is also light but juicy with strawberry, soft cherry and red currant, spiced by black pepper. The tannic structure builds throughout the sip."
Saint K,Grenache Blanc,90.0,28.0,1,"Ripe Anjou pear, Key-lime skins, white lily and white peach show on the nose of this wine from an increasingly popular vineyard. The palate is clean and straightforward, with pear cider, Gala apple and concrete minerality."
Saint K,Syrah,93.0,38.0,1,"Even considering the cool vintage, this warm-site wine comes in at an alcohol level rarely seen in the state. There's no mistaking the variety, with abundant aromas of freshly cut green and jalapeño pepper that are followed by elegant, reserved cherry and spice flavors. It provides a lot of intrigue and enjoyment."
Saintsbury,Chardonnay,90.56,55.56,9,"An unusual blend of two-thirds Petite Sirah and one third Petit Verdot, this wine offers notes of baking spices, freshly tilled soil, dried cherries and flowers. The palate brings a mixture of purple and black fruit, backed by a wall of near-impenetrable tannins that still show balance and restraint."
Saintsbury,Pinot Noir,91.38,60.75,16,"This soft, stewy Zin tastes as if it were steeped in black tea and leather, giving it depth and concentration. As it opens, layers of black pepper pierce through, exploding on the finish amidst earthy cedar and sandalwood. It's a fine food wine that'll impress and improve as the meal goes on."
Salida,Red Blend,90.0,19.0,1,"Production has increased dramatically, but quality remains quite good for this estate-grown Cabernet Franc. Deep and plummy, it's a rich, round mouthful of blue and black fruits that are dressed up with plenty of spicy oak tones. The tannins are polished and bring some finishing flavors of black tea. This should age for a decade at least."
Salvatore Principe,Chardonnay,87.0,10.0,1,"A blend of eight different Syrah clones and a splash of Grenache, this is dark and sappy, with dense veins of citrus oil, licorice, coffee liqueur and black tea that are anchored by a solid black-cherry flavor. This should drink well for a decade or longer."
Salvatore Principe,Zinfandel,86.0,11.0,2,"This single-vineyard 100% Cabernet Franc is firm, juicy and focused. It has a phenolic bite at the back end, along with lemony acids. The concentration of fruit and herb flavors is excellent, which makes it a fine steak wine and also a bottle to stow away for a few more years."
Salvestrin,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.67,91.0,3,"Compost and pencil shaving scents meet reductive mushroom-like notes on the nose of this grippy, full-bodied wine that includes small amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Bittersweet chocolate rounds out the finish."
Salvestrin,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,24.33,3,"Honeysuckle and jasmine punctuate the pretty aromas on the nose of this wine, which is tart and lemony on the palate. Intensely flavored, the oak is subtle and supportive."
Samuel Louis Smith,Pinot Noir,93.0,44.0,1,"Golden honey and banana flambée aromas make for an inviting if quite rich introduction to this wine from Kamasutra-themed LXV. Baked apple and poached peach flavors meet with vanilla dust and salted caramel on the palate, which is rich and creamy with a balance of tension."
Samuel Louis Smith,Syrah,91.0,33.0,2,"The aromas are bright and generous, with notes of honeysuckle and canned peach. The fruit is so sweet on the palate, it drinks almost off dry, with abundant stone-fruit and floral flavors that linger."
Samuel Robert,Pinot Noir,88.0,27.5,4,"This wine is brightly aromatic, with notes of fresh herb, kiwi and pineapple. The palate is full flavored, showing a sense of poise along with a tart finish. The concentration doesn't seem all there."
Samuel Robert,Riesling,87.0,22.0,2,"High in acidity, restrained and focused on freshness above all else, this wine shines with wet stone, Meyer lemon and grapefruit peel flavors."
Samuel Robert,Rosé,86.0,25.0,1,"Buttery peach crumble and vanilla bean flavors are balanced by floral aromas and a rounded, likable character in this bold, full-bodied white."
San Antonio,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,30.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 75% of this wine, with the balance Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Aromas of smoke, herb, red and black fruit and spice are followed by plentiful dark-fruit flavors. It delivers a sense of hedonism."
San Antonio,Red Blend,92.0,85.0,1,"This wine has more depth, volume and textural roundness than most of its peers in California, seasoning its ripe fruit flavors with the herb, leather and sage accents characteristic of the variety. It has good balance, complexity and a lingering finish that begs for another sip."
San Antonio,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,28.5,2,"This value-oriented white delivers nuanced flavor and body, mixing honeyed apple, pear and toasted oak flavors with crisp acidity on the midpalate."
San Juan Vineyards,Chardonnay,85.0,20.0,1,"Golden hay in color, this clonal exploration imparts light-bodied peach, graham cracker and orange flavors, the latter showing prominently on the nose. Bright acidity keeps it youthfully refreshing, with both body and weight in balance."
San Juan Vineyards,Madeleine Angevine,85.5,17.5,2,"This light-peach-colored wine brings appealing aromas of peppery spice, watermelon, citrus and herb. The flavors are dry and broad in feel, with a pleasing lick of acidity that keeps the interest high."
San Juan Vineyards,Red Blend,83.0,18.0,1,"This Napa-based company has acquired some Oregon Pinot from a top vineyard, and made a tasty, nicely detailed wine with it. Scents and flavors conjure up plum, candied orange peel and baking spices, guaranteed to tickle the taste buds. It's a little bumpy in the finish, perhaps as a result of the long ride south taken by the grapes. Drink now while it's at its best."
San Juan Vineyards,Riesling,83.5,15.0,2,"Orange-red in color, this wine is dry, meaty and weighty, with a broadness on the palate. Peach skin and flesh are strongly represented in flavor, feeling at once refreshing and bold enough to stand up well to food."
San Simeon,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.0,70.0,1,"Made by Robert Pepi, this wine reveals an elegance of dried herb and forest floor, while dry, generous tannins pack a punch. Blackberry and mocha lurk in the background, unable to overcome the wine's greener aspects."
San Simeon,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.67,25.0,3,"From a vineyard on the eastern side of the Silverado Trail in Oakville, this is rich and robust with a depth of dark berry flavor, tobacco and earth. Lush on the palate it's a special-occasion kind of wine, gorgeous and generous and a fine example of winemaking and viticulture coming together in a magical way."
San Simeon,Chardonnay,88.0,18.0,2,"The Volcanic Hill section of Diamond Creek's vineyard on Diamond Mountain is, as advertised, influenced by volcanic soils. The wine imparts a chalky consistency to some extent, rounded out by dark, ripe plum and mocha, with a long, intense finish. Age through 2025."
San Simeon,Merlot,89.5,25.0,2,"This wine has deeply concentrated yet focused and spicy purple-fruit tones. It's generously endowed with notes of tobacco, licorice, mineral and pepper. The highlights keep piling on through a finish that seems to run for several minutes. This bold wine is enjoyable now but should also cellar well through 2020."
San Simeon,Petite Sirah,89.33,29.0,3,"Uplifting aromatics of blackberry soda and purple flowers provide a nose that could be sniffed all day, hinting at a fun but elegant GSM. The flavors fall in line, with cola, Bing cherries and rose water combining for a light, floral palate, yet with green tea tannins and tartness to keep it grounded."
San Simeon,Pinot Noir,89.0,25.0,1,"More people would crave Mourvèdre if it were done in this style, with light rather than heavy leather scents alongside purple fruits. Once sipped, it hits the tastebuds with blueberry soda, tobacco, licorice, black pepper and wild game, all restrained and juicy rather than brooding and thick."
San Simeon,Syrah,85.0,22.0,1,"Fess Parker's sister winery hits a savory home run with this blend of 62% Syrah and 38% Grenache, which presents game, leather, blackberry extract and sage on the nose. Purple fruit leads the palate, with dark chocolate on the midpalate and strong acidity and smooth tannins throughout."
San Simeon,Viognier,88.4,21.2,5,"An attention-grabbing sense of umami introduces this wine, with darkly colored mushrooms, plum sauce, miso soup and black sage tickling the nose. There is dark chocolate with bits of espresso on the palate, which is leveled by plum skins and berry flesh, with bitter tar and black pepper on the finish."
Sanctuary,Pinot Noir,92.67,40.0,3,"A whirlwind of aromas—peppered black cherries, elderberry, caramel, toast, barrel smoke—rise off this appellation blend from German-born winemaker Matthias Pippig, who handcrafts small batches on Santa Barbara's Eastside. It's very soft on the palate, with medium-dark flavors of butter-crusted plum pie and an herbal note of pine pitch keeping it serious."
Sandhi,Chardonnay,94.2,69.0,5,"The sister wine to Ruby Leigh, this Cabernet-based blend is sourced principally from Red Mountain vineyards. It opens with scents of violets and moves into a firm palate mixing cassis, herb and iron shavings. Excellent structure cellaring through 2025."
Sandhi,Pinot Noir,91.0,38.0,1,"From Mt. Eden and Wente clones grown at 1,700 feet, this under-$30 bottling shows key lime and pomelo pith freshness on the nose, backed by chalk, crushed sea shell and tangerine blossom aromas. There is a fine-grained texture to the tannins on the palate, where bright citrus fruit meets with marcona almond touches. It's simultaneously refreshing and savory."
Sandler,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,55.0,1,"A beautiful black currant character animates this classically-styled wine. It's fruity and generously spiced on the nose, with cinnamon and nutmeg scents from oak. Its flavors build on that black currant, with spice notes giving it a layered effect, supported by fine-grained tannins. While irrestible now, this will be best after 2019."
Sandler,Chardonnay,89.67,40.0,3,"This particular block was first planted in 2007, so these are young vines. Sometimes fruit from young vines will burst forth in spectacular fashion, and that's the case here. Supremely aromatic, this opens with a velvety mix of Asian spices, fruit leather, plum, cherry, cocoa powder and coffee grounds. All this and more can be tasted as well as sniffed, with excellent penetration through a lingering, cedary finish."
Sandler,Pinot Noir,91.2,38.4,5,"A bold and brawny wine from a relatively cool appellation, this red satisfies with its commingling of violet, meat and leathery black pepper aromas. Despite its brambly depth and concentration, it allows for a satisfying twist of freshness on the finish."
Sandler,Syrah,88.0,20.0,1,"From one of the most ocean-adjacent vineyards in the state, this is a swarthy and powerful bottling, showing black plum, violet, olive and coffee touches on the concentrated nose. There is a bracing acidity and upright structure to the palate, while the flavors remain power-driven: stewed plum and hoisin sauce, with an espresso-like finish."
Sanford,Chardonnay,92.0,39.0,3,"Very little of this wine exists, sadly, given its gorgeous mix of mint, dried herb and feral, meaty notes. Despite its rustic flirtatiousness, it allows for floral aromas to accent the expansive palate, revealing hints of white pepper, citrus and smoked meat."
Sanford,Pinot Noir,91.12,50.88,8,"Cherry pie aromas kick off the nose of this bottling from a steep hilllside site behind Cambria. Clove, nutmeg and maple-cured bacon notes follow. Blackberry, vanilla and clove flavors glide on the palate, which offers ample tannins and acidity for cellaring, although the wine is delicious now."
Sanford,Viognier,92.5,36.0,2,"The unfolding layers of aroma on the nose of this bottling—sesame, white pepper, rose and wild berry, to name a few—keep one coming back for more. The palate is textured and finishes on an uplifting note, showing raspberry, dried flowers, fresh herbs and a hint of menthol toward the end."
Sanglier Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,45.0,1,"Aromatic with a waft of wax, this dry Riesling is bright with lemon and lime acidity. There's just a suggestion of petrol on the finish."
Sanglier Cellars,Chardonnay,85.5,28.0,2,"Blackberry jam, cherry blossom and a touch of baking spice show on the nose of this wine from a Westside Paso property. Nicely tight and bright on the palate, it is structured with fine-grained tannins.It offers blueberries, clove spice and a rocky character throughout the sip, especially into the finish."
Sanglier Cellars,Grenache,90.0,45.0,1,"Kiona Vineyard on Red Mountain provides the fruit for this wine, along with Chandler Reach in the Yakima Valley. Baking spice, clove and anise aromas are followed by light, tart red fruit flavors that trail slightly toward the spice filled finish."
Sanglier Cellars,Merlot,89.0,30.0,1,"Strong white flower aromas, from honeysuckle to jasmine to tuberose, meet with fresh apple blossoms and tropical elements of banana and coconut on the nose of the bottling, a blend of 60% Marsanne, 38% Roussanne and 2% Grenache Blanc. There's a sharp and sizzling acidity on the palate, where apple flesh and red pear flavors dance across the tongue with gusto."
Sanglier Cellars,Pinot Noir,89.67,46.33,3,"Dark-blue fruit, thyme, sweet barrel spices and mineral aromas lead to pitch-black fruit flavors that show the warmth of the vintage but retain their balance. The tannins provide some pucker."
Sanglier Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.67,45.0,3,"The melon, pear, tropical fruit and almond butter aromas are bright and effusive, while the flavors are considerably more delicate and subdued, showing a lovely sense of nuance and tension. It doesn't quite all come together but provides plenty of intrigue."
Sanglier Cellars,Rosé,86.0,22.0,1,"Equal parts Syrah and Merlot (40%), this wine is finished off with Pinot Noir. Vanilla, baking spice, licorice, woodspice and cherry aromas lead to plump, tart cranberry flavors that linger. The wood is heavy at times, which is a shame as the balance of the fruit is spot on."
Sanglier Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,24.0,1,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (61%), Merlot (25%) and Cabernet Franc, the aromas of spice, graphite, vanilla, and dried and fresh herbs are all high toned, with the fruit seeming subdued. The flavors are pitch-black, displaying the warmth of the vintage while keeping its heat in check."
Sanglier Cellars,White Blend,89.0,24.0,1,"Lively aromas, an appetizing balance and just-rich-enough fruit flavors make a good combo in this medium- to full-bodied wine. It has subtle herb and kiwi aromas, crisp apple flavors, and a texture poised between supple and tangy."
Sanguis,Chardonnay,93.0,60.0,1,"Rounded, warmer notes of Gala apple, lemon rinds and flaky pastry show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling from veteran Chuck Carlson. The palate is clean and complex, with apple bitters, orange rind and wet-stone elements."
Sanguis,Grenache,90.0,77.0,1,"This reserve shows nice lime/citrus scents, hints of honey and a bit of sandalwood, which is quite interesting. It's an elegant, lightly spicy, complex and subtle wine, with delicious nuances and a dancer's balance."
Sanguis,Pinot Noir,93.0,80.0,1,"In ‘99 Adelsheim bottled two separate clonal selections; this year they have elected to combine the two. This lovely, young wine, with very ripe, tight fruit, is already showing a bit more peach, apricot and tropical scents than the previous vintage. This is a concentrated, complex and powerful style, which harnesses the oak rather than being driven by it. Delicious and exceptionally long."
Sanguis,Red Blend,93.0,65.0,2,"Darker than the winery's other single-vineyard Pinot, this one shows intense raspberry/loganberry flavors, and some spice and pepper too. There is good concentration in the midpalate, with tart, tangy, tightly-wound fruit and well-integrated tannins. I would prefer a bit more new oak, but even so there is a pleasant toasty bite to the finish."
Sanguis,Syrah,91.43,71.29,7,"A blend every year of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot, the 2010 is rich and spicy, rounded with soft tannins and prime red raspberry and cherry fruit. Well integrated, a layering of chocolate, coffee and clove finish the wine off nicely."
Sanguis,White Blend,91.0,55.0,2,"The Amador Zin specialist is offering its first ever Grenache here, a tremendous debut, super light in color and texture, lightly rendered to show off its layers of delicate violet and raspberry amid a meatier backbone of lurking anise and herbs. With 9% Mourvedre and 5% Syrah, this is a light red worth seeking out."
Sant Wines,Pinot Noir,92.0,47.0,1,"This is the first Chardonnay for Daedalus Cellars. Flavors are rich and full-bodied, with candied orange peel, sweet citrus and vanilla most noticeable among them. Left on the lees for almost 18 months, this is wide open and ready to drink."
Santa Barbara Winery,Chardonnay,90.67,25.0,3,"Some tasters will celebrate the elegance and finesse of this lightweight Pinot; time will be the ultimate judge. At the moment it is a bit out of balance; there is light cherry fruit, plenty of alcohol, some grainy, earthy tannins and overall a lack of integration. Maybe it just needs more time in the bottle; the components are good enough—tart cranberry and strawberry flavors, sharp acids, some minerality and an earthy underpinning. It just hasn't (yet) come together."
Santa Barbara Winery,Grenache,89.0,28.0,1,"Moderately ripe, with decent varietal character, this light and tart single vineyard offering tastes of simple berry/cherry fruit, with hints of more herbal elements. The finish gets chalky."
Santa Barbara Winery,Lagrein,91.0,33.0,1,"Off-dry and fruity, this lively Riesling is notable for its strong honeysuckle scent and the follow-up flavors of lemon and honey. Its best flavors come on early; after a while it starts to recall a honey/lemon cough drop."
Santa Barbara Winery,Petit Verdot,90.0,30.0,3,"A chewy, high-acid take on Merlot, with a strong herbal note to the tannins. It might almost pass for Carmenère. The fruit flavors are subdued but ripe enough, and the alcohol touches 14.7%. This is the sort of muscular Merlot that can take the place of Cabernet alongside a grilled steak."
Santa Barbara Winery,Petite Sirah,88.67,28.0,3,"Strawberry preserves, leather and chocolate are all in the mix here, nicely mingled and mutually supportive. This is a sinuous, fleshy, fruit-driven wine, but there's plenty of chocolaty oak in the soft, lightly peppery finish. Forward and appealing, this is one to enjoy right now."
Santa Barbara Winery,Primitivo,92.0,28.0,1,"Still young and pulling itself together, this barrel-fermented Chardonnay already has a soft, lush, appealing mouthfeel. Flavors build upon barrel toast, butter and caramel, with clean green fruits and a hint of nut oil in the finish."
Santa Barbara Winery,Riesling,88.0,16.0,1,"An affordable blend that is almost 60% Malbec, the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, Franc and Syrah. It drinks well, smooth and polished, and the rough tannins that can often overtake the fruit in this region have been nicely managed here, pulling the wine into balance. Strawberry and light black cherry, some herb and tar, and good grip for an everyday red."
Santa Barbara Winery,Sangiovese,90.0,26.0,1,"This is barrel fermented, and it's for the consumer who loves the oakier style of Chardonnay. This excellent vineyard has the fruit concentration and acidity to stand up to the barrel flavors."
Santa Barbara Winery,Sauvignon Blanc,85.0,19.0,1,"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It leans slightly into the green, with aromas of fresh herbs mixed with vanilla, chocolate and other barrel spices. The palate is elegant, with a soft feel to the chocolate, cherry and barrel flavors."
Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,42.0,3,"Napa's Duckhorn house heads south for this ripe-style bottling that shows browned butter, vanilla, squeezed tangerine and dried pineapple on the nose. The palate is ripe and powerful, with honeysuckle, poached apple and lime-syrup flavors."
Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard,Grenache,91.5,25.0,2,"Reserved fruit and spice flavors, and a soothing, gripping texture will make this medium-bodied blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon a great dinner guest. Plenty of tannins give a fine sandpaper feel on the tongue, and the wine will counterbalance the richness of meat, fowl and game dishes."
Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard,Pinot Noir,90.0,37.0,2,"Notes of dried cranberry, cherry, licorice and medicine cabinet predominate, with the aromas seeming somewhat advanced. The flavors are full bodied and high-octane, with the tannins needing time to stretch their legs."
Sante Arcangeli,Chardonnay,91.4,30.4,5,"Rich in oak and tannin, this wine delivers big flavors of blackberry and plum, supported by rounded layers of soft acidity and mouthfeel. Dark in color, it's a bold wine with plenty of personality and power."
Sante Arcangeli,Pinot Noir,91.0,52.29,7,"This ambitious, against-all-odds island project with ancient grapevines is showing promising results, in this case offering smoked meats, hard spice and very tight purple fruit on the nose. The palate is tart with cranberries and raspberries, with a pencil lead and earth character, proving quite interesting if not entirely Zin-like."
Sapolil Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,48.0,1,"There's plenty of appeal to the aromas, with notes of toast, spice and peach. The palate offers sweet, lightly creamy-feeling stone and tropical-fruit flavors that convey balance. The barrel influence (new 500L puncheon) is there but doesn't get in the way."
Sapolil Cellars,Syrah,90.0,35.0,1,"From a historic vineyard in a region that rarely grows this grape, this wine features a nose with tangy red-fruit punch, concentrated pomegranate, crushed violets and a slightly sour shred of menthol. The palate shows lots of eucalyptus and dried mint along with cranberry fruit."
Sarah's Vineyard,Chardonnay,90.0,30.67,3,"Bing cherries and cranberries are spiced with black cardamom on the slightly cough-syrupy nose of this wine. Iron and blood flavors show on the palate, with dried red cherries and rose petals."
Sarah's Vineyard,G-S-M,88.0,32.0,1,"This clonal combo from a meticulously tended family vineyard shows iron, cranberry, strawberry blossoms, sagebrush and a wound-up minerality on the nose. Sanguine flavors power the tip of the palate alongside cranberry and pomegranate fruit. A suave spiciness of dried mint and menthol emerges in the midpalate."
Sarah's Vineyard,Grenache Blanc,84.0,20.0,1,"Barrel spice, dried herb, toast and cherry aromas lead to tart fruit flavors that narrow toward the finish, with tart acids livening it all up. Perhaps some more time will pull it all together."
Sarah's Vineyard,Marsanne,84.0,26.0,1,"This wine has ripe black cherry flavors, great acidity and firm tannins that keep it lively enough to balance the fruity richness. Full bodied, broad in mouthfeel, but with a background tanginess, it is well balanced and keeps encouraging another sip."
Sarah's Vineyard,Pinot Noir,89.88,40.5,8,"A study of the darker side of the grape from Josh Baker and Matt Brain, this shows black cherry, olallieberry, sarsaparilla and black pepper on the nose. The palate is also unctuous with black licorice, black cherry and cola, with eucalyptus and sage spices adding excellent complexity."
Sarah's Vineyard,Red Blend,87.0,28.0,1,"This wine spent three months in 38% new French oak, which softens and adds a bit of barrel-induced richness to the mouthfeel. It remains a fascinating mix of flower and citrus, with lightly-buttered toast and a lush, lemon-custard flavor."
Sarah's Vineyard,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.5,30.25,4,"The third release from this vineyard, this wine is juicy in fruit, tar and leathery tannins, a mix of raspberry, cassis and dark chocolate. From a dry-farmed site, with a small percentage of Petite Sirah, it was given less than a year in American oak and offers a taste of sweet tobacco on the finish. Drink now through 2020."
Sarah's Vineyard,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,24.5,4,"Complex and generous on the palate, this vineyard-designated varietal is surprisingly light and bright in spirit, ethereal even, offering aromas of black pepper, violets and gunpowder, hard to figure out but inviting nonetheless. On the palate, juicy plum and dark cherry provide an exuberant edge."
Sarah's Vineyard,Syrah,88.5,28.0,2,"Dark, deep purple in color, this Petite grown in Contra Costa is still quite closed and tight with no signs of opening anytime soon."
Sarah's Vineyard,Viognier,90.0,28.0,1,"This wine brings immediate appeal, with notes of blueberry, vanilla and baking spices. The palate is sweet and supple, with plentiful blue-fruit flavors that linger."
Sarah's Vineyard,Zinfandel,88.25,30.0,4,"Italian varietals can excel in this SoCal zone, and this Sangiovese-led Super Tuscan blend is a prime example, with crushed graphite, tobacco, juicy blackberry and woodpile notes on the nose. Dried oregano, marjoram and thyme arise on the palate, with a sultry baked-plum flavor on the midpalate and pencil shavings and incense throughout."
Saucelito Canyon,Zinfandel,92.0,34.0,1,"Made in a rather austere style, with minimal time in oak, this wine offers crisp texture and body complemented by a tartness of Golden Delicious apple that finishes with creamy lushness."
Sausal,Zinfandel,90.0,22.0,1,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (78%), with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Aromas of barrel spice, cedar, green herbs and black fruit are followed by tightly coiled fruit and barrel flavors that need some time to settle in."
Savage Grace,Cabernet Franc,90.33,26.0,6,"This is the inaugural release of this wine, which is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec. It brings aromas of espresso, toast, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla and dark berries. The fruit and barrel flavors are soft and sumptuous, playing off each other nicely through the finish."
Savage Grace,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,38.0,1,"Made from Biodynamic-certified grapes, this opens in tangy cranberry and orange, a refreshingly bright lift for the variety. Full bodied, it teases in leather, pepper and a touch of smoky oak, remaining in balance as it plays out on the palate."
Savage Grace,Chardonnay,90.0,24.0,3,"Made from Syrah from one of the producer's oldest estate blocks in the Petaluma Gap, this wine has breezy lightness, a delicacy that compels. Cherry, vanilla and strawberry center around tingling acidity and a meaty underbite, finishing dry and balanced."
Savage Grace,Gewürztraminer,89.0,26.0,1,"This perennial offering from the producer, the longtime proprietor of this fine vineyard, showcases cassis and chocolate in full-bodied, undulating waves of big, brash flavor. Despite the mountain provenance, the tannins are soft and well integrated, never distracting from the ripeness of the fruit."
Savage Grace,Grüner Veltliner,89.0,24.0,1,"Light in color and nuanced in oak, this full-bodied beauty doesn't hold back on richness, allowing plenty of room for an expanse of salted caramel, pineapple and preserved lemon. Layered and robust throughout the midpalate, it lightens up on the intensity through a crisp finish."
Savage Grace,Malbec,89.5,26.5,4,"This wine is a blend of 45% Grenache, 37% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre, coming from Boushey, Pepper Bridge, Olsen and Minnick vineyards. The aromas pop with notes of clove, orange peel, black pepper, funk and red and blue berries. The palate is lithe, pure and focused, with a pleasing mouthfeel and sense of balance to the citrus and blue-fruit flavors."
Savage Grace,Pinot Noir,88.0,28.5,4,"This is 100% Syrah from three vineyards: Funk, Les Collines, and Ranch at the End of the Road. Seamless, sexy scents of blue and purple berries, vanilla, licorice, black tea and cut tobacco swirl up from the glass and carry through to the palate. One third of the fermentation include whole clusters, adding savory flavors to the finish. An elegant Syrah for lovers of the grape."
Savage Grace,Riesling,89.67,20.0,3,"A 100% varietal wine coming from Block 14 of this up-and-coming vineyard, it has a lot of appeal with notes of dark-brewed coffee, chocolate, cherries and black raspberries. Aged 18 months in half new French oak, it's silky, soft, and supple, showing a lot of polish and restraint."
Savage Grace,Rosé,89.0,22.0,1,"A blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre, it's an immediately appealing wine with notes of coffee, black olive, blueberry and smoked meat. There's a pleasing texture and richness running from head to tail with coffee and chocolate flavors that linger on the finish."
Savage Grace,Sauvignon Blanc,88.33,19.0,3,"Sourced entirely from the Boushey Vineyard, this is light but complex. A mix of rhubarb, pomegranate, earth and mushroom, it has a suggestion of savory umami flavors and even a hint of stable, all in good balance."
Savage Grace,Syrah,90.67,31.67,3,"A very dark color and ripe, almost raisiny aromas lead to rich, opulent flavors like chocolate-covered cherries and blackberry jam. These saturate a velvety texture of good acidity and firm tannins. While the wine is full of big flavors from ripe or overripe grapes, it has the structure to support them."
Savannah-Chanelle,Cabernet Franc,83.0,50.0,1,"All varietal and aged in neutral French oak, this wine offers brooding aromas of coffee, cream and violets. The herb and savory flavors are soft and reserved in feel with a lingering finish."
Savannah-Chanelle,Pinot Noir,91.5,47.5,2,"This wine is 40% each of Grenache and Mourvèdre with the balance Counoise. It's lighter in color, with aromas of plum, boysenberry, herbs, flowers and peppery spices. It's palate-coating with silky, sweet fruit flavors that linger."
Savannah-Chanelle,Red Blend,88.0,60.0,1,"Juicy and soft, this special super-sized bottling will make for a fun wine at a large gathering, approachable and suitably full bodied. Red fruit and oak intermingle around velvety textures of integrated tannins, finishing in a long seasoning of allspice."
Save Me San Francisco,Chardonnay,87.0,10.0,2,"This holds two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and a splash of Petit Verdot. Oak aromas of butterscotch, woodspice and vanilla are out in front of cherry and herbs. On the palate, the oak flavors lead, followed by coffee and cherry. It seems a bit heavy-handed right now but may come together with time."
Save Me San Francisco,Red Blend,87.0,10.0,1,"Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. It displays directly appealing aromas and flavors of dried herbs, cherry, plum, woodspice and milk chocolate with a fleshy feel."
Save Me San Francisco,Sauvignon Blanc,85.5,12.5,2,"The aromas of huckleberry, flowers and blueberry are bright, with a dark-chocolate top note. The palate is full bodied and rich, made in a hedonistic style with a tart finish."
Saviah,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.2,34.4,5,"This intriguing wine features herb, lemon twist, tobacco and spice aromas. The blue fruit flavors are lush in feel, with fine-grained tannins."
Saviah,Bordeaux-style White Blend,88.0,20.0,1,"Aromas of toast, yellow apple, corn silk and whiffs of tropical fruit lead to a restrained, elegant palate with a lightly creamy feel."
Saviah,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,45.0,1,"This is a savory and tasty wine, with smoke, red cherries and bacon fat on the nose. The mouthfeel is dense, with rich flavors of black cherries, licorice and dark chocolate offering layers of complexity, rounded out by the right amount of tannins and acidity."
Saviah,Chardonnay,89.0,25.0,2,"Lemon butter, shreds of nectarine and a dash of sea salt make appearances on the fairly faint nose of this wine from San Jose-based winemaker Adam Comartin. The wine comes alive once sipped, with white peach flesh, lemony acidity and chalky grip, all culminating in a zing that goes on for minutes, finishing with a touch of marzipan."
Saviah,Red Blend,90.0,31.38,8,"Salmon colored (and salmon would make a good pairing), this sparkling rosé has deep flavors of toasty oak and black fruit, along with a swath of sweetness on the finish."
Saviah,Riesling,88.0,15.0,2,"A blend of three estate vineyards, this is all-stainless fermented, tart and tasting more of skin than flesh. Citrus flavors of lemon and grapefruit, firm acidity and a wash of minerality keep it clean and refreshing."
Saviah,Syrah,91.82,46.0,11,"Tart and fruity, with young fruit flavors of spiced cranberry and sappy raspberry, this may be a touch too sour for some palates. But if acid is what you like, and you want a Pinot with some snap and verve, this will suit you just fine."
Saxon Brown,Chardonnay,93.33,54.67,3,"The herbal Boulder Bluff bottling remains rather stubbornly closed, even after being open for several hours. It's tart with fruit flavors of cranberry and green apple."
Saxon Brown,Pinot Noir,91.33,48.0,3,"Hearty in toasty vanilla, this softly textured Primitivo has a wealth of blackberry fruit and weighty texture that veers dangerously close to overpowering before pulling back and finding its balance. The finish keeps you coming back for more."
Saxon Brown,Syrah,91.0,38.0,2,"This may be the best bottling yet by actress Drew Barrymore and her team. The pale-pink wine offers light pink lemonade, plum, cherry and bubblegum aromas. The palate combines lime juice, pluot flesh and mandarin zest, set against a chalky backbone and laced with bright acidity."
Saxon Brown,Sémillon,86.0,28.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (55%) and Syrah, a first for this producer. The aromas bring notes of bittersweet chocolate, pencil lead, smoke, barrel spice and black and purple fruit. The flavors are well balanced and tart, supported by grainy wound-up tannins that need some time to unfurl. Give it a short decant if drinking in the near term."
Saxon Brown,Zinfandel,91.0,38.0,2,"Varietal Malbec is rarity from this appellation. This one brings aromas of purple fruit, barrel spice, black pepper, plum and spice that are followed by pitch-black-fruit flavors. The tannins bring a gentle squeeze."
Sbragia,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,77.62,8,"This light, elegant wine is perfumed like a rose garden, joined by lavender and dried herb. Its light take is supported by integrated tannin and a lurking tease of smoky meat and toasted oak that adds savoriness to its ethereal character."
Sbragia,Chardonnay,89.0,33.6,5,"Baked black plum, gingerbread, cherry compote and nutmeg show on the rich and lavish nose of this bottling. It's a mouthful once sipped, with cooked blackberries and blueberries heavily spiced by crushed clove, and wrapped in tannins that stand up tall toward the finish."
Sbragia,Merlot,91.0,32.0,1,"Focused blackberry aromas meet with graphite shavings, a touch of new leather and chipped oak on the nose of this Bordeaux blend. The medium-bodied palate offers dark purple-fruit flavors, cocoa dust and anise, lifted by strong acidity. It finishes with a vanilla-toast element."
Sbragia,Petite Sirah,90.0,45.0,2,"Aromas of cocoa powder, cherry, medicinal notes and herb lead to a palate chock-full of black-fruit flavors with bittersweet-chocolate accents. It's an unabashedly delicious and ripe offering of this variety with a finish that sails."
Sbragia,Zinfandel,90.4,37.6,5,"Aromas of herb, freshly sliced green pepper, cherry and spice lead to plush and sweet plum flavors, speckled with dark-chocolate accents throughout. It brings an impeccable sense of balance along with an appealing texture. Might be a little green for some tastes."
Scar of the Sea,Chardonnay,92.0,46.0,1,"Nutty and substantial in texture, this pink sparkler is abundant in white peach, flowers and green apple. It's sharp and focused, with rich undertones of cherry and rose. The developed mouthfeel is balanced by dry, stony acidity."
Scar of the Sea,Pinot Noir,93.0,53.0,4,"A light, elegant nose of almonds, apple and honeysuckle, followed by fresh flavors of nuts, apple and flowers on the palate. Pretty, balanced and lingering in the finish. A great food wine."
Scarborough,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,35.0,1,"Cigarbox, pepper and red cherry on the nose leads into vanilla, smoke and cedar on the palate. Rich but not heavy, it will pair well with cured meats, cheeses, heartier dishes."
Scarborough,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.5,25.0,2,"This generous and full-bodied wine made in partnership with country singer Zac Brown has ripe fruit and sweet-seeming spice aromas that continue into the flavors, softening its gentle, already mild tannic texture. While previous vintages were from the North Coast region, this one carries the broader California appellation."
Scarborough,Riesling,91.0,15.0,1,"Quite pale in color, this wine offers well-defined aromas of apple, cantaloupe and pear. The palate has a textured feel and brings a pleasing sense of purity along with tart acidity. A winning offering of this seldom-seen variety, it should go particularly well at the dinner table."
Scarborough,Syrah,89.0,35.0,1,"Garryana is the winery's previous moniker; once this vintage sells through all wines will be labeled Martin Woods. This bottling mixes green, gold and botrytized fruit from a single vineyard, all picked on the same day. The result is intriguing, though a bit disjointed. Bright gold, pungent and waxy in the mouth, it mixes accents of honeycomb with green-apple fruit that almost tastes like straight cider. The finish is quite dry."
Scenic Valley Farms,Pinot Noir,89.0,26.0,1,"Thick and concentrated in black and red fruit, this is a spicy, robust and oaky wine that shows the power of the vintage and site."
Scheid Vineyards,Pinot Noir,87.0,19.0,1,"Blue-black in color, this wine is dense in leather and grippy oak, a coming together texturally and on the palate in baked plum and blackberry. Full bodied, the wine settles in the glass to offer breadth and depth."
Schermeister,Pinot Noir,92.0,47.0,1,"Made from 68% Pinot Noir and 32% Syrah, this ethereal wine is pillowy in candied aromas of lemon and lime. Pinkish-copper in color, it's light, bright and succulent, and then finishes dry and with brevity."
Schlagel Santo,G-S-M,90.0,42.0,1,"This blend of 68% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Merlot hits the nose with aromas of brick, uncrushed clove, red cherries, wet gravel, rosewater and a touch of tobacco. The palate is surprisingly light, but packs cedar, pipesmoke, clove and nutmeg against a red cherry and cranberry backdrop."
Schmidt,Merlot,85.0,34.0,1,"Though billed as a Super Tuscan, this is an odd but refreshing wine for those seeking something different. The Cab-Sangio blend offers strong black pepper, brambleberry, pink peppercorns and a touch of pasilla chile on the underripe nose. The palate is light in body but full of bright cranberry fruit and intriguing herbals, led by green peppercorns."
Schmidt,Riesling,81.0,22.0,1,"Aromas of char and toast are quite up front, though they smooth out over time and give way to lemon meringue. The tropical fruit, butter and spice flavors are broad and well balanced, with a creamy feel and a lingering finish. The oak gets out front, but there are good things going on."
Schmitz 24 Brix,Red Blend,84.0,24.0,1,"Briny and dark copper-orange in color, this is a weighty wine, though the alcohol level is low. The tannins and leathery texture of the Syrah shine through, checked by tangy citrus and a hit of white pepper."
Schooler Nolan,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,27.0,1,"From the Malibu-based producer, this bottling has a striking label design that matches with the youthful, vivacious pink wine. The punchy nose blends cherry, lime blossom and pink rose petals with yeasty, sourdough-like aromas, while the palate offers iron, maraschino cherry and lime-wedge flavors."
Schramsberg,Champagne Blend,93.6,127.8,5,"Supple white-fleshed fruits, from pear to cherimoya, touch the nose, as do aromas of lemon rind, struck match and dried apple on this blend of 90% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Viognier. A gravelly, pencil lead minerality on the palate is boosted by sliced lemon wedges, cut grass and gooseberry notes."
Schramsberg,Chardonnay,93.0,67.5,2,"Brambly and spicy red and black fruit mark this mighty Cabernet, sourced from the famed To Kalon Vineyard in the heart of Oakville. Despite its name it offers only Good Times, a well-composed, unabashedly hedonistic taste of juicy ripe Napa fruit and overtly lush tannins."
Schramsberg,Pinot Noir,93.33,59.67,3,"Concentrated and lively, this showcases luscious black cherry fruit that's perfectly framed with zippy acidity and ripe tannins. It's a full-bodied, New World style, but with a complex, layered finish that says Oregon rather than California."
Schramsberg,Rosé,94.0,97.5,2,"There's pronounced power in this Pinot, a selection of 14 barrels given 18 months in 71% new French oak. Complex, it achieves a sense of balance that will come into greater focus over time. At the moment, it offers kirsch notes and sizzling acidity around a core of peppery allspice and toasty brioche, but it will only continue to develop and evolve with age."
Schramsberg,Sparkling Blend,92.21,60.66,29,"This flinty Chardonnay shares a full oak expression with a whiff of petrol, suggesting a decant or cellaring until 2016 to fully soften. It offers sublime lemon curd and minerally peach flavor amid tangy acidity and a bright finish. It displays a ying-yang between polish and power."
Schug,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.25,57.5,4,"This dry wine from the Ribbon Ridge vineyard, adjacent to the winery, is briskly tart without being sour. Flavors of lemony tea and Meyer lemon meringue intrigue immediately. There is splendid structure and complexity in play here, with layers of flower, citrus and mineral, all in perfect harmony. It's easy to believe this wine could age through 2024, even longer."
Schug,Chardonnay,90.75,42.5,4,"This complex Syrah has a surprisingly deep, dark red color, almost like a Port, but it's not nearly as heavy as it looks. It boasts intricate flavors, a firm but not fat structure, and signature cool-climate Syrah characteristics of black pepper, wood smoke, plum and grilled meat flavors. Medium-bodied and silky textured, it sips smoothly and leaves you wanting more."
Schug,Pinot Noir,87.75,40.0,4,"There's something magical in the dirt of this vineyard, and it shines extra bright in this bottling. The nose combines cranberry and light pomegranate with a fennel funk. Next, the palate starts with a zing of acidity followed by layers of flavor. Red currant and raspberry morph to cola, mocha and dried lavender, then finish on tart cranberry."
Schultz,Merlot,87.0,23.0,2,"Not a good year for this wine, which is green and fuzzy on the tongue, a strange waft of chemical overpowering over all."
Schultz,Pinot Noir,89.0,29.0,1,"A pretty, perfumed Pinot Noir, with gorgeous streaks of kir and vibrant blackberry and cherry. It's subtle and structured, with a pronounced layer of earthy forest floor on the finish. With sprinklings of spice, it dazzles from beginning to end."
Schultz,Syrah,89.0,26.0,1,"Complex and balanced, this barrel-select blend, all from estate-grown grapes, spent 11 months in roughly half new French oak. Tart red and black fruits are nuanced with baking spices and darker notes of clove and espresso. This wine carries an extra level of depth and weight, as befits a designated reserve. Delicious now, or cellar until 2024."
Schulz,Albariño,85.33,20.0,3,"Truly elegant, this displays the complexity of vines now hitting maturity at almost 20 years of age. Spice, clove, herb and cherry flavors mix with a dash of truffle. The lower alcohol and juicy acidity of the vintage contribute to a lingering, textural, complex and beautifully balanced finish."
Schulz,Red Blend,86.0,30.0,1,"This is an easy-gulping, light wine with fruity aromas, nice cherry and raspberry flavors, medium body and a soft mouthfeel."
Schweiger,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,65.0,1,The tart hard fruit is well hidden behind chalky tongue-scraping acids. The wine quickly hits a finish with tough tannins and a residual note of wet paper.
Scott Family,Chardonnay,90.0,25.0,5,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, this well-made wine offers aromas of campfire and cedar, plus a taste of black currant and leather. With tightly wound tannins, it's rich and full, with a long-lingering finish. It will stand well against burly meat dishes."
Scott Family,Pinot Noir,90.5,31.0,2,"Savory and herbal, this Roussanne is given more time on lees and made to be rich and complex. It accomplishes those goals, providing medium body and high acidity, a texture that is dry, and wild in honey and dried apricot. Pair with lobster."
Scott Harvey,Barbera,88.0,35.0,1,"There are said to be fewer than 100 acres of Teroldego in California, so this one is worth trying. Midweight and fruity, it has lavender, anise and leather lightly folded into the mix. A good wine to start the evening and enjoy by the glass."
Scott Harvey,Red Blend,85.0,17.5,2,"This is an intriguing combination of 59% Chenin Blanc, 25% Roussanne and 16% Viognier from a range of California regions, including Clarksburg, Santa Barbara and Sonoma County. Barrel-fermented and given some time in used French oak, it offers a tasty mélange of fig, guava and vanilla custard, a viscous mouthfeel and a crisp, complex finish."
Scott Harvey,Syrah,89.33,25.33,3,"Though hailing from the warm, dry 2012 vintage, this wine remains quite restrained in style with its notes of wild strawberry, freshly rubbed mint and cola. It doesn't quite have the concentration to deliver all that the aromas promise."
Scott Harvey,Zinfandel,90.56,35.56,9,"Experimenter-in-chief Kenneth Volk tackles this Mediterranean grape of ancient origins. Stone fruit dominates the nose, suggesting peach pie, peach jam, even peach pudding, with some sweet Stargazer lily floral notes as well. The peach transforms to melon, apple and caramel on the palate."
Scott Paul,Pinot Noir,91.88,52.35,17,"This is a bright, effusive, estate-grown, unfiltered white, delineated by high-toned acidity and gorgeously floral aromatics. Planted originally in 1975 to heritage Wente clone Chardonnay by owner/winemaker Tom Dehlinger, its generosity of fresh apple and pear ride a voluptuous, balanced texture that's wholly satisfying, before meeting deeper hues of spicy, exotic tropical tones on the finish."
Scotto Family Cellars,Rosé,88.0,13.0,2,"Made from one of the vineyard's historic blocks, this is a lush, inviting and complex wine, defined by golden honey apple and nutmeg. The texture is contoured and structured, with the richness of lemon meringue, but the balance is what stands out most. A tang of white pepper flirts on the finish."
Scotto Family Cellars,Zinfandel,86.0,13.0,1,"This fine marriage of site and winemaker shows experience and intuition at work, presenting a full-bodied, lush and plush expression of tremendous depth and complexity. It offers notes of tart apple, licorice and a wealth of orange zest, which adds a touch of citrusy crispness to the naturally buoyant minerality and nuanced oak. It has much more to share; drink now through 2020."
Scratch,Pinot Noir,88.67,36.0,3,"The velvety approachability of this soft, supple wine belies a strength and sophistication always at the heart of this producer's wines, an intensity of flavor and power that commands attention. Black currant, black cherry, sage and smoky oak ride atop an underground of black pepper, combining ultimately into a tantalizingly juicy package. Drink now through 2023."
Screen Door Cellars,Pinot Noir,92.0,65.0,1,"Juicy acidity buoys layers of wet stone, crisp apple and white peach in this lovely aromatic white. Textured, subtle and complex, it's fresh in the glass, accented in floral rose petals, grapefruit and lemon peel, dry and fermented entirely in stainless steel."
Script,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,35.0,2,"Brooding and dark, this softly structured wine is juicy and brimming in tension, its acidity focused and supportive. Black cherry, a subtle touch of cinnamon spice and toasted oak find balance and equal more than the sum of their parts, providing for a luxurious experience in the glass."
Script,Cabernet Franc,91.0,45.0,1,"Pale straw in color, this wine brings alluring aromas of toast, spice, clarified butter and stone fruit. The palate is full bodied with sweet, generous peach and tropical-fruit flavors that sail on the finish."
Script,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.25,50.0,4,"This winery's name is a nod to the adjacent Pleasant Valley Cemetery in San Miguel, where the warm climate suits Zinfandel well. Plump and bursting boysenberry and lingonberry aromas are dusted with vanilla and marjoram on the nose. The palate's flavors range from ripe red fruit to clove-driven spice and herbal touches, with pepper-laced acidity."
Script & Seal,Red Blend,88.0,13.0,1,"Cloak & Dagger's film noir styling fits the dark and brooding character of this wine. Cola and graphite aromas mix with fresh blackberry and blueberry on the nose. The palate is well-structured with tangy, plum skin-like acidity while delivering satisfying dark chocolate, black olive and black cherry flavors."
Sculpterra,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.33,40.0,3,"These quirky labels mark a stylish shift in Temecula, where traditional branding has long reigned, yet the wine is as solid as ever. This blend of 64% Petite Sirah, 13% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Franc, 7% Shiraz and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon shows dried black currant, turned loam, dark chocolate dust and dried mint aromas. The flavors are reminiscent of classic Old World bottlings, with cedar, dried herb and stewed plum laced with fresh acidity and a dry texture."
Sculpterra,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.6,42.6,5,"Plump Asian pear and sea salt aromas accompany lighter hints of butterscortch and marshmallow in this barrel blend from William Foley's estate in the heart of the Sta. Rita Hills. There is a textural pull to the palate, while Gala apple, sea salt and marzipan flavors provide richness."
Sculpterra,Merlot,87.0,32.0,1,"This brooding, brawny wine made from mountain fruit is all about mushroom and compost notes—a true expression of the vineyard's surroundings. Black cherry fruit and youthful tannins provide context, with a sizzling streak of acidity."
Sculpterra,Mourvèdre,91.0,36.0,1,"Gamy roast lamb aromas meet blueberry and crushed bay leaf on the nose of this bottling—a shining example of Syrah from southern Santa Clara County. White pepper, thyme and graphite notes show on the palate, where a core of elderberry fruit core is enhanced by that feral, gamy quality."
Sculpterra,Primitivo,88.0,24.0,1,"As salty as preserved lemon brine, this wine is medium-bodied, with integrated oak, having aged in 33% new French barrels. Golden delicious apple and a spicy bite of quince round out the subtle fruit flavors, bolstered by gravelly texture."
Sculpterra,Red Blend,91.67,39.33,3,"Dark and brooding with blackberry and boysenberry flavors, this fresh, juicy wine boasts generous oak and tannin. Sourced from the estate vineyard of Freeman Winery in Sebastopol, it gains clove and dried herb nuances as it develops."
Sculpterra,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,40.0,1,"This has long been a favorite wine from the region, and this vintage's blend—45% Marsanne, 25% Grenache Blanc, 27% Roussanne and 3% Picpoul—is a lesson in deft restraint. Crisp lime skin and Pink Lady apple aromas converge, mixing sharp and ripe elements. On the palate, yellow grapefruit flavors are light and refreshing, framed by brilliant acidity and grippy texture."
Sea Monster,Chardonnay,91.0,20.0,2,"A 100% varietal wine, this features big oak and dry tannins around a rustic core of full-bodied black cherry and dried plum. Savory tobacco and tea provide a sultry edge to the proceedings, before tartness comes to bear on the finish. Enjoy now through 2018."
Sea Monster,White Blend,86.0,20.0,1,"Light in color and texture, this is a rose petal aroma-driven wine, floral and herbal in equal waves. Smooth and subdued, it showcases cherry cola and ripe, integrated tannins while remaining lively on the palate and through a lengthy finish."
Sea Smoke,Chardonnay,92.0,60.0,1,"This crunchy, tart and tasty blend is 55% Viognier, 30% Marsanne and 15% Roussanne. Highlights of green berry, lemon-lime and grapefruit are refreshing and well matched to lighter pasta dishes or simple poultry entrées."
Sea Smoke,Pinot Noir,92.83,70.67,6,"Named after the traditional boat used on the Douro River, this dessert wine, made from 50% Tempranillo, 34% Touriga Nacional and 16% Tinta Cao, is a muddy brown-red color and shows aromas of concentrated raisin and turned earth. Pipe smoke, prunes, kirsch and caramel flavors combine for a very lasting finish, allowing this to function much like Scotch and work well with cigars."
SeaGlass,Chardonnay,87.0,12.0,1,"Concentrated red cherry, black tea leaf and a touch of minerality show on the nose of this blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 14% Malbec, 12% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot. A line of concentrated blackberry powers the palate, which also offers woody mint and rose-petal flavors."
Seal Beach,Pinot Noir,93.0,35.0,1,"Rich, thick and dense, this is a powerfully concentrated wine, blended with 4% Viognier in a Northern Rhône style. The grapes are grown in Oak Knoll from dry-farmed vines that yield very little. Black plum, tar and cooked meat combine for complexity atop the high alcohol."
Seal Beach,Syrah,93.0,38.0,1,"Lemon-honey candy, chopped garden herbs, sliced spring onions and appealing aromas of cut tennis balls show on the nose of this wine from an extreme coastal vineyard near Cambria. Lively green flavors power the palate, with chive, dill, apple-skin bitterness and a detectable salinity."
Sean Minor,Pinot Noir,88.0,48.0,2,"All five Bordeaux grapes are in the blend, roughly 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot dominating the flavors. The vines average 30+ years. Tart purple fruits are set against spicy barrel flavors. The wine, still quite young, should continue to improve with bottle age. It's balanced and pleasant, though it pulls up a bit short."
Sean Minor,Red Blend,88.0,22.0,2,"Fleshy and floral, this is a delightfully light, dry and tropical wine, with primary characteristics of apple and lime. Refreshing, it'll serve well as a versatile companion on the table or as as worthy apéritif, finishing in grassy fig and pear."
Sean Thackrey,Cabernet Franc,91.0,130.0,1,"Grapefruit blossoms, scratched pink grapefruit skin and Granny Smith apples show on the delicate nose of this blend of 54% Sémillon, 43.5% Sauvignon Blanc and 2.5% Orange Muscat. It's light, bright and easy on the palate, with cut green apple and lime juice flavors, making it perfect to pair with plenty of lighter foods."
Sean Thackrey,Pinot Noir,94.0,60.0,1,"From Mount Veeder comes this blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Malbec, 7% Petit Verdot and 6% Cabernet Franc. Cherry and vanilla dominate atop a thickness of oak and soft, smoky tannins. Juicy on the finish, it may need more time to come around, the grapes 100% estate grown."
Sean Thackrey,Red Blend,93.0,120.0,1,"This is an earthy wine with a persistent thread of acidity that keeps it fresh and vibrant in the glass. Bursting with red cherry and pomegranate fruit, it has rich complements of compost and black licorice."
Sean Thackrey,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,24.0,1,"All estate fruit goes into this reserve, which was tasted a few months ahead of its official release. It's tight and herbal, with stiff tannins streaked with tobacco and vanilla. Give it another year or two of bottle age, and drink 2018 to 2022."
Season,Carmenère,86.5,38.0,2,"Named for a barrel that once rolled off a cliff, this forward fruity wine blends numerous sources to craft an easy-drinking, no-frills style. Think a strawberry lollipop in a glass, and you're on the right track. That's not to say it lacks concentration, but its strength is the pretty fruit."
Season,Grenache,89.0,38.0,1,"Leather, bark and tar meet cola and black licorice scents in this full-bodied, ripe red. Its palate is layered and showy in meaty, sanguine personality."
Season,Red Blend,85.5,36.0,2,"From estate-grown Pommard clone fruit, this wine shows earthy forest notes against moderate acidity and mellow oak. Medium-bodied, it plays well on the palate with a balance of cranberry and clove flavors."
Season,Sparkling Blend,88.0,18.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (39%), Cabernet Franc (29%), Merlot (19%), Malbec (9%) and Petit Verdot. It explores the first two varieties's leafier sides, with aromas of garden herbs followed by graphite, orange peel and barrel spice. The palate is tart and fresh, full of cranberry flavors supported by lightly chewy tannins. It brings a pleasing sense of acidity that bodes well for its longevity."
Season,White Blend,88.0,18.0,1,"The aromas are bright, with notes of fresh herb, red cherry, Red Vines, orange peel and barrel spice. The palate shows a pleasing sense of concentration and richness, with light meaty notes on the finish."
Sebastiani,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,90.0,1,"Very pithy aromas of grapefruit, squeezed lemon, crisp Asian pear and a touch of chalk show on the nose of this bottling, another strong argument about how well this variety can do in cool coastal California. The flavors are light and crisp, with yellow apple and yellow-grapefruit pith most prominent."
Sebastiani,Zinfandel,87.0,22.0,1,"This wine is half Grenache, with the balance Mourvèdre (31%), Syrah (14%) and Counoise. Lighter in color, it brings aromas of cranberry, cherry, spice, smoked meat and herb. The tart cranberry flavors are full bodied, showing a sense of purity and balance, pulling up a bit on the finish."
Secret Squirrel,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,25.0,1,"This solidly built, dry wine made from the unusual Tannat variety has mild apple and cherry flavors and great balance. Its texture is firm due to good acidity and a touch of tannin, which makes it versatile with foods from pho to barbecue."
Sedition,Pinot Noir,90.0,75.0,2,"Fairly sweet aromas of marzipan, honeysuckle, candied apricot and honeyed orange slices show on the nose of this bottling from a longtime winegrowing family in the Watsonville area. It's much tighter and brighter on the sip, with flavors of slightly sour green-pear skins and poached apple, and a touch of caramel on the finish."
Seghesio,Red Blend,90.0,60.0,2,"The first rosé from this winery is a direct press with a several hours of skin contact, coming from new plantings at this esteemed vineyard. Pale cherry in color, it brings pleasing aromas of strawberry, citrus zest, green pepper and mineral. The palate is dry, sleek and stylish, with abundant, tart citrus-rind flavors that keep the interest high, finishing with a green herbal note."
Seghesio,Sangiovese,91.0,54.0,2,"Very oaky, very buttery, very posh in texture, this wine takes the spicy richness of oak-barrel fermentation and aging to a high level. It's not at all shy about the toast, caramel and baking-spice flavors, with a mouthcoating texture that helps those accents linger on the finish."
Seghesio,Zinfandel,89.8,37.5,10,"This wide open Syrah shows berry and heavy vanilla notes. As the flavors wind through the palate, the back end seems to tighten up, and it finishes with a somewhat green, lightly herbal flourish."
Seia,Syrah,87.5,30.0,2,"A new wine from Hahn Family, Boneshaker is appropriately named: It's a big-boned, hearty swath of velvety milk chocolate and jammy fruit flavors. With just the right amount of Zinfandel spice and oak influence, it will please a barbecue-loving crowd."
Senses,Chardonnay,91.0,65.0,2,"This Bordeaux-style blend is mostly Merlot. Fragrant and spicy, it intrigues with a sensuous mix of brown spices, cumin, citrus and toast. Soft and open, it moves into the lush middle with blackberry and black cherry fruit, more spices and citrus, all nicely melded."
Senses,Pinot Noir,90.0,55.0,1,"From a superior block at the Red Willow vineyard, this pure Syrah was aged in 100% new French oak. It's concentrated and tangy, with wild berry fruit streaked with oolong tea, licorice, dark chocolate and coffee liqueur."
Senses,Rosé,90.0,25.0,1,"Full of delicious dark-fruit flavors, this is smooth and deep, comforting but sophisticated. The fruit flavors are ripe and satisfying, the texture is velvety and broad, the body is full but not heavy."
Sensorium,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,36.0,1,"Bright and alive in crisp pear and fresh citrus, this is a lovely, spicy Chardonnay, integrated and pleasing on the palate. The juicy fruit flavors delve into a creamy texture that lingers through to the finish."
Sensorium,Viognier,91.0,20.0,1,"Pronounced Kay-lee, this Syrah is unabashedly funky. If you like a wine with generous aromas of barnyard and garden, along with potent, ripe, berry-laden fruit, this delivers in spades. Barrel aging adds chocolate and dark espresso character to the finish."
Sequel,Syrah,91.5,85.0,2,"Perfumey in lemon curd, this is a focused and fairly lean Chardonnay, crisp in lemony acidity and classic wet stone. Mango and lime surround a core of refreshing, intriguing ginger, and the palate offers creamy softness. A bite of fresh pear lingers on the finish."
Sequin,Pinot Grigio,84.0,13.0,1,"This blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah presents a lively, aromatic mix of raspberries, Kirsch and strawberry preserves, with pitch-perfect structure and balance. The intensity, immediately upon opening, is riveting. Drink this now–2017 while it's so delightfully fresh."
Sequoia Grove,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,121.67,3,"This proprietary blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, Grenache, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon delivers a deep and layered nose. Wild blackberry jam, pine pitch and white sage converge, like a walk through the California chaparral. The acidity is amazingly vibrant, with flavors of bright purple fruit, pepper and crushed herbs on the finish."
Sequoia Grove,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.62,87.5,8,"Delicious aromas of cherry-crusted beef, coconut, blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream and sassafras frame this blend of 63% Syrah and 37% Cabernet Sauvignon from southern Monterey County. The wine coats the mouth luxuriously, with black cherry and pepper spice. It drinks well now, but has mouth-coating tannins that will evoke with time."
Sequum,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.2,61.4,5,"In a blind tasting, it's hard to imagine many people would identify this wine as from Washington, due to the coolness of the vintage and the style. It's almost impenetrable when first opened, with brooding notes of graphite, exotic spice, herbs, toast and dark fruit. The acids are mouthwatering, the tannins firm and tightly wound, and they need significant time to uncoil. But when they do, the wine glorious. Give it at least until 2019 in the cellar or a 24+ hour decant. One of the highlights of the vintage."
Sequum,Red Blend,88.0,51.67,3,"Darker and riper in tone than the winery's Walker Hill Vineyard bottling, this is creamy and lush, with toasty caramel accents and spicy, tropical fruit. Balanced in acidity and soft in tannins, it is structured and rich, highlighting the beauty and diversity of Green Valley."
Sequum,Zinfandel,92.67,38.33,3,"This deftly hits on all cylinders, delivering big fruit, firm acid, fresh mineral and rich, toasty new-barrel highlights. Juicy, textural and deep, it's a wine to gulp, to savor and to share."
Ser,Chardonnay,89.0,28.0,1,"Principally Syrah, this includes 15% Grenache and 3% Mourvèdre. Rich and complex, supple and subtle, the mix of red, blue and purple fruits is potent, but also brings a welcome wash of wet stone and a dash of pepper. The focus and intensity are exemplary."
Serena's Vineyard,Syrah,89.0,24.0,1,"Decadent in coconut flake and vanilla, this is a fruity vintage of one of Hobbs' top-of-the-top Cabernets. Soft and structured, the silky tannins deftly managed, it captures the essence of the Napa Valley's best valley floor grapes at the hands of an expert winemaker, a textbook marriage of beauty and brawn."
Sergio,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,125.0,1,"Still a bit fragmented, this offers a core of tight apple and peach fruit. It was barrel fermented (10% new) and that shell of barrel flavors has not yet smoothed into the fruit. Give it brisk aeration or another year in the bottle."
Sergio,Grenache,84.0,40.0,1,"Light aromas of lemon, apple, pineapple, toast and spice lead to just off-dry flavors. It drinks a little sweet for a brut but still delivers enjoyment—a straightforward crowd pleaser."
Sergio,Malbec,90.0,75.0,1,"This brawny, dry wine has oak, tannin and body in big portions, its dark color leading to cut wood aromas, tart black cherry and blackberry flavors and a firm, somewhat drying texture. It needs rich food as a pairing or more time in the bottle to mellow."
Seufert,Dolcetto,87.0,28.0,1,"As if its electric pink color wasn't enough to attract attention, this medium-bodied wine has effusive candied fruit aromas and just-picked red fruit flavors. Flavor intensity and good acidity give it a lot of personality."
Seufert,Pinot Noir,88.0,40.0,1,"This is a well-proportioned, pleasantly balanced wine made from white Rhône grape varieties. It has plenty of fruit and a smooth, almost soft texture. Fresh apple and pear aromas meet nutmeg and vanilla flavors on the palate."
Seufert,Sparkling Blend,90.0,50.0,2,"Baking spice and vanilla aromas are at the fore, followed by blue fruit and barrel spices. The barrel influence (71% new French and American) leads on the palate as well, with abundant vanilla flavors that wash over the fruit. There's some good fruit underneath, if you can get to it."
Seven Angels,Red Blend,89.0,32.0,2,"Light, fresh and yet slightly rich on the nose, this bottling shows aromas of white flower, Asian pear and lemon-laced crème brûlée. There is strong grip to the sip, with tight lime peel and pith flavors as well as hints of white peach flesh and honeysuckle. Roasted nuts arise on the finish."
Seven Angels,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,38.0,1,"The nose of this bottling is both floral and savory, blending roasted beef with lilacs and a creamy boysenberry mousse. The palate is cohesive and pleasant, with dark berries, a touch of roasted game and more purple-flower petals, carried by a persistent acidity."
Seven Angels,Rhône-style White Blend,89.0,22.0,1,"Light and subtle yet distinct aromas of pineapple meet with crushed white rocks on the nose of this bottling. Pineapple juice flavors also arise on the palate, with is lean and crisp with touches of ripe lemon and pear flesh."
Seven Angels,Syrah,90.0,36.0,1,"From Glenrose Vineyard, this blend of 31% Mourvèdre, 23% Tannat, 16% Syrah, 16% Counoise and 14% Grenache is very earthy and mineral-driven, with crushed black rocks, asphalt, incense, dark-purple flowers and a touch of blackberry on the nose. It's relatively lightweight on the palate with grippy tannins, showing tart berry and bay leaf flavors."
Seven Angels,Zinfandel,92.0,29.0,1,"Fresh purple flowers and pressed boysenberry fruit meet with hints of smoke, herbs and white pepper on the complete-package nose of this bottling. The palate offers a strong sense of pepper, purple flowers and plummy fruits, finishing with a lifting character of juniper and dried mint."
Seven Bridges,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,40.0,1,"This luxurious wine revolves around a velvety texture of pure decadence and full-bodied pleasure. Earthy in clove and mushroom, the fruit dives deep into rich aspects of dark cherry and huckleberry."
Seven Bridges,Malbec,86.0,34.0,1,"Tart and tangy, these recently grafted Riesling vines deliver just-ripe flavors of Meyer lemon, lime, grapefruit and pineapple. It's close to a fruit bomb, but the significant acid underpinning keeps it juicy and gives it extra lift."
Seven Bridges,Merlot,89.0,26.0,1,"This robust, refined wine, dusted in tiny additions of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, is impressively crafted, seamless in approach and velvety in texture. Juicy blackberry and black currant, along with softer notions of black cherry, highlight buoyant acidity and a lush, thick finish. This should show best between 2023 and 2028."
Seven Daughters,Red Blend,88.0,13.0,1,"Some hints of sweetness and a touch of minerality annotate this wine, which bursts with flavors of peaches and tangerines. It's dry enough to pair with most Riesling friendly fare, and in many ways the most accessible and fruit-forward of Trisaetum's eight Rieslings."
Seven Daughters,White Blend,86.0,13.0,1,"Among the four Rieslings designated as off dry, this shows the most sweetness on the palate, with a slightly granular mouthfeel, like crystallized cane sugar. It accents the round fruit flavors of Meyer lemon and satsuma orange, which overflow the midpalate and run into a lingering finish with a touch of orange pekoe tea."
Seven Deadly Zins,Zinfandel,87.29,16.0,7,"A handful of Pritchard Hill Petit Verdot adds color and vibrancy to this impressive wine, sinewy in leather, black pepper and robust cigar. Currant and cedar highlights make for a classic profile, with firm, integrated tannin in support. This wine should do well in the cellar, finding its peak between 2021 and 2023."
Seven Falls,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,40.0,1,"Enhanced with 5% Roussanne, this bottling offers deep blueberry and blackberry fruit on the nose alongside touches of black licorice, oak smoke, sandalwood and caramel. Hints of juniper and pine needle show on the thick palate, giving a bitter complement to the thick and unctuous blueberry and fudge flavors."
Seven Falls,Red Blend,89.0,18.0,1,"An aroma like charcoal and fennel leads to concentrated smoke and black-pepper flavors and a taut, tannic texture before more generous nuances like black cherry and savory lentils kick in. It's a fascinating wine that develops more layers and complexity as it breathes. Best after 2019."
Seven Falls,Rhône-style White Blend,85.0,40.0,1,"This much-admired vineyard brings exotic scents of ripe black-cherry fruit soaked in Asian spices. The wine is compact and powerful, with strong tannins and a light whiff of tar. Drink 2018 through 2026."
Seven Falls,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,30.0,1,"A warm site first planted in 1913 in the heart of the appellation, this vineyard also holds Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah. This wine is hearty and deceptively elegant, mixing flavors and aromas of rum raisin, leather and clove. Gentle tannins wrap around a finishing brightness of red and black berry."
Seven Falls,Syrah,88.0,40.0,1,"Pungent citrus notes of kumquat, tangerine, Meyer-lemon pith and grapefruit give depth to accents of apple blossom and toasty seared lemon. This well-constructed wine shows Meyer lemon-rind flavors, a pithy grip and a touch of almond that provides richness to the midpalate."
Seven Falls,Viognier,87.0,30.0,1,"A touch of campfire smoke invites the nose into this bottling from a historic vineyard. It also offers aromas of dark cranberry, black raspberry, chipped slate and roasting meat. The cran-raspberry element explodes on the generous palate, backed by that familiar smoke, which is laced throughout this wine."
Seven Hills,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,57.33,9,"Matured in 50% new French oak, this wine offers medium concentration and appealing scents of rose petals, apples and cranberries. The tangy fruit is juicy and firm, and nicely balanced for cellaring."
Seven Hills,Cabernet Franc,90.33,29.33,3,"This is a little tight upon opening, showing just touches of flower, herb and earth. Tangy cranberry and black cherry flavors come with an underlying minerality. This is a wine to decant or cellar for a few more years."
Seven Hills,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.24,43.67,21,"This is a first-rate Oregon Pinot Gris made with fruit sourced from the Methven Vineyard. Crisp and steely, it's a mix of cucumber and honeydew melon fruit, with bracing acidity and excellent length."
Seven Hills,Malbec,91.0,35.0,3,"Though low in alcohol even by David Hill standards, this excellent Pinot Gris does not lack fruit or flavor. Ripe and tasting of pretty pear and orange fruit, it shows evidence of some well-balanced residual sugar. Vivid acidity cuts through to a satisfying finish."
Seven Hills,Merlot,91.88,34.5,8,"At first taste, this is a difficult wine to evaluate because of its tight, compact and tannic structure. Pomegranate and strawberry fruits slowly emerge from a shell of earthy tannins, suggesting that with a few more years in the bottle this will evolve into a broader, more expressive wine."
Seven Hills,Petit Verdot,91.0,33.33,3,"Short and sharp, this “Proprietor's Limited Release” is simply a plain, generic style, with a bitter finish."
Seven Hills,Red Blend,90.8,33.2,5,"Petit Verdot is not an easy grape; here it turns volatile, the grapes pruney, and the finish tannic and short."
Seven Hills,Riesling,88.0,22.5,4,"This blend of Bordeaux varieties (39% Cab Sauv, 37% Merlot, 12% Petit Verdot, 8% Cab Franc and 4% Malbec) opens with a nice purity of fruit, mainly plum and cassis and shows a deftness of blending. There's a touch of green pepper at the finish."
Seven Hills,Rosé,89.0,17.0,3,"A purplish Cab with smatterings of Petit Verdot, Petite Sirah, Grenache and Merlot that starts out quite tannic, mellowing into a nicely balanced dinner-table wine, with hints of cranberry and black currant and subtle oak. A great deal for a well-made Cab that should get even better with another 2–3 years in bottle."
Seven Hills,Viognier,90.0,20.0,1,"In 2011, the fifth vintage of this Riesling, the alcohol is down a bit, as is the price. It remains quintessentially fruity, done in a tangy/tart sweet and sour style. Juicy apple, kiwi, peach and pear flavors fill the mouth in a most satisfying style, perfect for front porch sipping."
Seven Oxen,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.5,40.0,2,"This broad, muscular blend is sourced from seven vineyards and aged for 18 months in French oak. It's relatively open and fruity, with berries, earth and spice all in proportion through a gentle fade."
Seven of Hearts,Chardonnay,88.0,26.0,2,"This is a very fairly priced Cabernet given its quality. It's made from 100% Cab and all estate grown in the high elevations of Fair Play in El Dorado County. Oaky and smoky, it whispers of mountain fruit, with herb, cassis and blackberry highlights amid a background of savory earth. Age 3–5 years."
Seven of Hearts,G-S-M,85.0,25.0,1,"Stark and sharp at first, this blend of Roussanne, Marsanne, Viognier and ­Grenache Blanc is sophisticated, with notes of pear and stone fruit—such as apricot and white plum—that are accentuated by a figgy finish. With plenty of meat on its bones and a lush mouthfeel, it'll stand up to thick sauces and the richness of lobster and crab."
Seven of Hearts,Pinot Noir,88.5,42.0,2,"In a strong lineup of beautifully balanced Pinots, this cuvée shows just a touch more stem and leaf, and keeps the fruit on the tart end of the berry and cherry spectrum. The tannins remain a bit stiff and unyielding, but overall the punch and weight suggest that this is a wine bound for further development and improvement in bottle. Drink 2018–2025."
Seven of Hearts,Roussanne-Viognier,88.0,18.0,1,"Fresh, enticing fruit aromas and a smooth yet firm texture make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. Toasted oak, ripe berries and cherries gush from the glass, and light tannins add grip to the generous mouthfeel."
Sevtap,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.33,42.67,3,"Made with only 30% whole-cluster, this bottling by Bradley Brown allows lusher red-cherry fruit to show on the nose, alongside slate, mint and sandalwood notes. Those same red-cherry elements meet with cranberry on the palate, growing more complex as layers of graphite, bay leaf, pine needle and turned forest floor arise."
Sevtap,Malbec,91.0,57.0,1,"Cinnamon and spearmint elements give depth to the pinpoint, laser-sharp fruit notes of cherry blossom and strawberry on this bottling. Strong herbal flavors of thyme and marjoram and spices of green cardamom of peppercorn hit the palate right away, seasoning cranberry and pomegranate fruit, and finishing on a slate minerality."
Sevtap,Merlot,87.0,34.0,1,"From a section of the rocky vineyard planted to the Martini clone, a thick-skinned grape, Deer Camp is full bodied, densely concentrated and marked by a streak of spiciness throughout. It's perfumed with roses and forest floor, while it presents a texture that is seductively velvety and smooth."
Sevtap,Petit Verdot,86.0,44.0,1,"Distinct aromas of sour plum and dried pomegranate meet with damp tobacco, forest floor, green olive and Greek spice on the nose of this clonal study. It's herbal on the palate, with oregano, marjoram and green cardamom notes, alongside cranberry and red cherry fruit in the midpalate. Altogether, it's a light, bright and highly seasoned wine."
Sevtap,Sangiovese,87.0,22.0,1,"An inviting mix of rose and nutmeg evolves into tightly woven layers of raspberry and blueberry, with the wine deftly showing its youth and fine-vintage pedigree. Powerful on the palate, it has weight and length, followed by softly lingering allspice."
Sevtap,Sauvignon Blanc,85.5,27.0,2,"Made with 60% Syrah from Monterey and 40% Cab from Santa Cruz, this blend shows blueberry, black plum and smoked beef on the nose, as well as touches of black pepper and lilac. The palate is plush and soft, with purple fruits enhanced by licorice, espresso, bitter cocoa and beef char notes, all laced with fresh acidity."
Sevtap,Sparkling Blend,90.0,45.0,1,"A fabulous, relatively affordable way to break into this cult winery, this blend of 30% Syrah, 26% Carignane, 22% Grenache, 19% Mourvèdre and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon offers teriyaki, char, fresh fennel, scarlet-red roses, anise, pencil lead and black raspberry on the nose. The sip is lively and action-packed with energetic peppercorn and lavender as well as richer tar, soy, blueberry and blackberry elements."
Sevtap,Viognier,84.0,21.0,1,"An elegant wine with sculpted berry fruit flavors, this is compact and persistent. A touch of citrus accompanies generous allspice and baking-spice highlights. The lengthy finish brings hints of sandalwood and caramel."
Sextant,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.4,59.8,5,"Cranberry, baked plum, black pepper and cigar play against secondary characteristics of black licorice in this well-crafted, balanced wine. Thick, yet structured, it juggles a layering of minerality against a richness of fruit, each complementing the other."
Sextant,Chardonnay,90.33,28.33,3,"The Nuages cuvée delicately includes lightly peppery herbal notes in the fruit-filled wine that leans toward blueberries and cherries. There is a streak of brown sugar, and the overall balance is exacting. Despite the relative youth, nothing seems awkward or out of place. Drink now through 2022."
Sextant,G-S-M,90.0,40.0,2,"Red Mountain fruit from three different sites is used to create this delicious Syrah, laced with powerful flavors of coffee liqueur and chocolate. Cofermented with a dash of Viognier, it's satiny and citrusy, speckled with pepper, and maintains an elegant precision for a wine that offers such richness."
Sextant,Grenache,86.0,21.0,1,"This top-tier vineyard delivers gorgeous flavors. Big, juicy, rich and round, it piles on the fruit flavors—apples, pears, white peaches and lemons. All are balanced against each other and the supporting, natural acidity, finished with a frame of new-oak toast. Drink 2016 to 2028."
Sextant,Merlot,93.0,35.0,1,"This block-designation wine from the tip of the appellation shows an extremely spicy nose of incense and concentrated hibiscus. It proves rather light on the palate, yet bounces with the flavors of rose petals and violets, emerging into black pepper, clove and cinnamon. It's lean yet bountiful with intrigue."
Sextant,Red Blend,89.83,52.67,6,"This wine is aromatically arresting, with notes of honeycomb, candle wax, corn husk, chamomile, almond and stone fruit. The palate has an outrageously textured, detailed, layered feel leading to an extended finish that displays both elegance and richness."
Sextant,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.5,62.5,2,"Made from 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Noir grapes, this sparkling wine features a thick mousse and high-tuned acidity, textured in a yeasty character and tart apple. The finish is clean and crisp."
Sextant,Zinfandel,90.67,25.33,6,"Offering a thick mousse and a waft of hazelnut Frangelico, this is a clear, crisp and smooth sparkling Brut, delicious in golden delicious apple that finishes clean and swift."
Shafer,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.5,140.83,6,"The 2011 vintage was a challenging one, and a reserve wine with alcohol this low is a bit of a stretch. Light, clean raspberry fruit is on display, with sharp acidity and no noticeable new oak influence."
Shafer,Chardonnay,93.67,52.0,3,"A refined blend of 31% Petite Sirah, 29% Petit Verdot and 27% Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller percentages of Malbec and Cabernet Franc, The Spur is a good representation of Livermore's best reds, with a concentrated core of black cherry, blackberry and herb."
Shafer,Syrah,95.0,87.0,1,"The Holstein designate offers pretty flavors of cherry and brambly berry, along with the Dr. Pepper character often found in Oregon. It's drinking well, though lacking the concentration that you would anticipate from the vintage and AVA."
Shafer,Syrah-Petite Sirah,92.0,85.0,1,"B.R. Cohn's more widely made Cab, this wine is sourced from multiple vineyards in Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake counties. Exhibiting currant, cranberry and mint on the nose and palate, it's restrained in texture, quite linear, with a quick, robust finish."
Shah Estate,Chardonnay,91.0,65.0,1,"Brooding aromas of dill, purple fruit, vanilla and wood spice are followed by full dark cherry flavors backed by a wall of firm yet still accessible tannins."
Shale Oak,Red Blend,93.0,75.0,1,"A red-mauve in color, this bottling shows pomegranate, watermelon, strawberry paste and brioche on the nose. It's a rich style of rosé, with strawberry, cherry and red-plum fruit lifted by clove spice and a strong acidity."
Shale Oak,White Blend,90.0,42.0,1,This bold but easy-drinking wine offers a good combo of lightly spiced oak notes along with fairly generous blackberry and raspberry flavors. The texture is smooth but with a good tinge of tannin.
Shane Wines,Grenache Blanc,91.0,24.0,1,"Grenache makes up 70% of this wine with the rest equal parts Mourvèdre and Syrah. The aromas of raspberry and spice are brooding while the raspberry, cranberry and floral flavors are tart and lithe, with a finish that lingers."
Shane Wines,Pinot Noir,92.5,42.0,4,"This smooth, velvety and succulent blend offers a density of milk chocolate, brown sugar and ripe red fruit. Sure to appeal to a broad range of palates that likes a fruit-forward, approachable wine, it finishes powerfully."
Shane Wines,Syrah,91.5,34.0,2,"This wine is principally Cabernet Franc along with dollops of Malbec and Petit Verdot. A pretty pale salmon color, it offers very primary aromas of strawberry, green pepper and spice. The palate drinks dry with lovely fruit flavors and acid that brings tension and keeps the interest high."
Sharabella Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,80.0,15.0,1,"Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon take the lead on this blend, with the balance Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Aromas of toast, vanilla and red and black fruit are followed by generous fruit and barrel flavors."
Sharabella Wines,Chardonnay,85.0,13.0,1,"This wine is a unique blend of Syrah, Merlot, Viognier, Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre. It seems locked up, with aromas of pickling spices, smoke, berry and vanilla that are followed by broad blue and black-fruit flavors that provide appeal."
Sharabella Wines,Pinot Noir,85.0,17.0,1,"This crisp, refreshing and all-stainless Chardonnay represents exceptional value. Bright, fresh fruit flavors mix apples, pears and ripe citrus. It's full-bodied and delivers plenty of mouth-filling richness without resorting to barrel aging for support."
Sharabella Wines,Red Blend,85.0,13.0,1,"This is a solid, slightly earthy wine of medium concentration. The black cherry core is framed with dried herb, dark chocolate, and a dusting of coffee grounds. In the context of the vintage, it seems to have a bit more heft and power than most of the other Adelsheim single vineyard Pinots."
Sharabella Wines,Zinfandel,82.0,16.0,1,"This well-aged release, from one of Oregon's premier vineyards, is soft and approachable, well-rounded with lovely plum and black cherry fruit holding down the center. Barrel aging adds baking spices to liven up the finish."
Shared Notes,Bordeaux-style White Blend,92.0,65.0,1,"This is a big wine in structure, but mellow and complex in flavor as if it's been well aged. Blended from Grenache, Tempranillo and Monastrell, it smells lightly sweet and tastes dry and inviting like vanilla, milk chocolate and raspberries."
Shared Notes,Sauvignon Blanc,90.5,65.0,2,"A blend of Bordeaux varieties, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Moderate in acidity and body, it has a ripeness to the fruit. Blueberry, chocolate and chalky, dusty tannin dominate, with a chill of violet perfume."
Shaw,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,84.0,23.0,1,"This wine is a blend of McKinley Springs and Alder Ridge fruit. Coffee and cherry aromas lead to restrained cranberry flavors, with the tannins bringing some dryness and grit."
Shea,Chardonnay,95.0,35.0,2,"This is showing an extraordinary amount of toasty oak in the nose, and once in the mouth it seems as if the oak and toast flavors overwhelm everything else. The fruit is very much on the light side, and can't begin to stand up to all the toast and butterscotch that is being tossed around. It's not bad, but it has not yet found its balance, and finishes with some lightly stemmy tannins."
Shea,Pinot Noir,93.17,65.72,18,"This budget-priced Syrah offers hints of why the grape does so well in Washington. It has a bit of peppery bite, some very tart cranberry fruit, crisp acids and a lifted, citrusy finish. Clean and varietal, it's a good everyday effort."
Sheldon,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,40.0,1,"A Bordeaux-style blend that spent three years in barrel, this is showing a dried blood/brick edge and has lost its primary fruit flavors. Plum and prune fruit, somewhat dried out, finishes with stiff tannins."
Sheldon,Graciano,94.0,48.0,1,"Crisp, citric aromas start this refreshing wine from Brotherhood. On the palate, citrus, apple and toast give the wine a more robust character. Friendly and easy to enjoy alone or with everything from salads to heartier cream dishes."
Sheldon,Grenache,87.0,40.0,1,"Though the first sniffs seem to promise a light, floral, elegant Pinot Noir, it turns vegetal in the glass, with tomato and herbal flavors."
Sheldon,Petite Sirah,91.0,28.0,1,Aromas of vanilla and stewed berries lead into a palate that features more of the same: sweet wood and overripe raspberries. Syrupy and simple.
Sheldon,Red Blend,92.5,37.0,2,"Starts off strong, with pleasant tangelo aromas and flavors.  But somwehere along the line the flavors turn varnishy, finishing with a strong note of lacquer."
Sheldon,Tempranillo,94.0,41.0,1,Strong mint and menthol aromatics give way to intense fresh-cut cedar flavors.  There's just too much wood for this woodchuck to chuck.
Sheldrake Point,Chardonnay,83.0,12.0,1,"This wine shows some of the less appealing aspects of American oak: overt spice and vanilla flavors and a slick, oily mouthfeel."
Sheldrake Point,Merlot,84.0,24.0,1,"Bright berry and red-currant aromas. Lighter in style than Cabs being produced by other LI wineries. The finish turns tough and leathery, not a good match for the delicate fruit."
Sheldrake Point,Riesling,85.5,14.5,2,"Sometimes Franc can have a lovely, alluringly floral bouquet; other times it can be downright vegetal and display green-bean characteristics. Unfortunately, this is an example of the latter. The wine has nice weight and texture, so if you don't mind your veggies in liquid form this might be more to your liking."
Sheldrake Point,Rosé,84.0,12.0,1,"Vanilla, butterscotch and some harsher oak-derived compounds dominate the modest citrus fruit that might have been wine before it was turned into oak juice. For wood lovers only."
Shenandoah,Zinfandel,86.0,10.5,2,"There's a lovely sweetness to the fruit, which tastes like ripe, just-picked blackberries. Old vines, 100+ years, deliver sweet, supple, sexy fruit. The wine has very dry tannins, and it might profit from some blending, but with a vineyard this special you have to admire the single-vineyard approach."
Shenandoah Vineyards,Moscato,85.0,13.0,1,"A blast of spice, mint, bramble and pepper explodes from the glass. The wine is dense, dark, deep and mysterious; the flavors pungent, penetrating and persistent. Tannic, layered with herbs and spices, powered with big, punchy fruit. This is classic Cline."
Shenandoah Vineyards,Muscat Hamburg,88.0,12.0,1,"This wine is a solid, stylish Meritage with assertive red fruit, a black pepper backbone and plenty of structure for aging. A touch of oaked spice adds dimension. A good overall red to pair with hearty winter fare."
Shenandoah Vineyards,Zinfandel,91.0,20.0,3,"This lush white starts with a nose of apricot and honey and leads into tropical fruit flavors balanced by a good acidity. Indulgent but fresh, it's a fun wine that will pair well with spicy Thai or Indian cuisine."
Sheridan Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,67.5,2,"Cherry and mocha on the nose start this wine nicely, and the flavors to follow—cherry, pepper, spice—are balanced and elegant. The tannins are somewhat aggressive and need time to soften. Give the wine 2–5 years and watch it unfold."
Sheridan Vineyard,Red Blend,89.0,25.0,1,"How's this for exotic: this red blend is made from the vinifera grapes Saperavi (from the former Soviet Georgia) and Sereksiya Charni (generally from Moldova). On the nose, the wine displays clove, tart berry, raspberry and black pepper, and on the palate, like flavors and solid tannins. There's a touch of dried tea to the blend and a decent finish, but the wine needs time to age--consider holding it for 5-10 years for the complexity to unfold. Overall, an appealing and interesting choice."
Sheridan Vineyard,Syrah,93.0,60.0,2,"Earthy, mature, beefy flavors lend an unorthodox but tasty personality, while medium body and light tannins form an appetizing mouthfeel. This variety is known for its earthy, wild character, so enjoy it!"
Shining Hill,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,45.0,1,"Light red in color, this rosé comes from one of the few grapes with red flesh, and is luscious as expected. Aromas of baked cherries, vanilla bean and strawberry pull in the nose, and the palate comes through with fruit punch, stewed red fruit and exotic orange notes. It's a crowd pleaser."
Shippey,Petite Sirah,87.0,32.0,1,"Fermented in stainless steel, this is a crisp white with decent acidity that traffics in pomelo, white fig and peach fuzz. It stays light in style and refreshing before finishing with a somewhat diluted feel."
Shooting Star,Blaufränkisch,86.25,13.25,4,"Brown sugar and chocolate make for a hedonistic experience in this brawny, powerful wine. It's well-composed in smoky char, juicy blackberry and a full-bodied finish of black pepper."
Shooting Star,Red Blend,87.0,14.0,1,"Creamy vanilla and pear pie provide a fleshy and full-bodied texture to this wine, which leans tropical in guava and melon. Aged in entirely neutral oak, the fruit shows well within a wave of ripeness."
Sibling Bubblery,Grenache,91.0,37.0,2,"The winery aims for Loire valley characteristics in its wines, hence the reference to Côt, as Malbec is known in the region. This is grapy, purple and young. At this point it's difficult to see much else beyond the fruit and lip-sticking acids. It's a good warm-weather quaffing wine, best served slightly chilled."
Sidebar,Red Blend,90.0,27.0,1,"Young, elegant, spicy and still quite tight, this is showing lovely fragrances of rose and cherry. In the mouth it seems more elegantly feminine, less powerful than the Bruno's II blend. Syrah contributes black pepper, raspberry and red currant; the Bordeaux grapes put some tannic muscle into the back end."
Sidebar,Rosé,91.0,21.0,1,"Big and bold, loaded with red fruits and sharp acidity, the Murray Syrah from Hightower brings a spicy mix of fruit, loam and mineral. There's some heat in it as well. The grapes are estate grown, and the Syrah was cofermented with 5% Viognier."
Sidebar,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,34.0,1,"This well built wine boasts tart cherry fruit and citrusy acidity. That lemony character carries through the finish, adding lift and mouth-cleansing astringency."
Sidecar,Red Blend,90.0,29.0,2,"A barrel-fermented white that offers complexity and nuance, this wine is steely and fleshy in texture, integrated and fully realized. Green apple, peach and vanilla combine effortlessly to reveal compelling flavor and length. This is a food-friendly wine that can also stand well on its own."
Siduri,Pinot Noir,91.41,51.4,63,"This is a rich, spicy and lush-fruited rosé. Its palate-pleasing tangle of citrus, peach and light tropical fruit is fresh, forward and inviting. It spent five months in neutral oak and is ready for immediate enjoyment."
Sierra Starr,Barbera,89.0,28.0,1,"This is from a cool-climate 9-acre site divided into two blocks, cooled by afternoon breezes off San Pablo Bay. It shows off the site in its embrace of high-toned fruit flavors of plum, blueberry, cranberry and dried cherry, the background meaty in chewy tannin and concentrated oak."
Sierra Starr,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,35.0,1,"Aromatic like an Orange Julius, this wine is velvety and crisp, with flavors of tart red cherry, peach and watermelon. Light bodied with ample weight, it finishes with a richness of vanilla swizzle."
Sierra Starr,Cabernet Franc,89.33,26.33,3,"With its mix of citrus, stone and tropical fruits, this appealing wine is just a touch past bone-dry. Sourced entirely from estate vineyards, it's supported by just the right amount of acidity. Drink through 2020."
Sierra Starr,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,20.0,3,"Aromas like butter, blanched almonds and honey lead to equally rich flavors and a soothing, fat texture for this indulgent wine. It has very good concentration that helps the fruit and nut nuances linger on the finish."
Sierra Starr,Syrah,88.0,25.0,1,"Sharp acidity doesn't get in the way of this wine's complex body and length, accenting the crisp fruitiness of lemon peel, grapefruit and white peach. Light-bodied and refreshing, it'll stand up to food as well as work as an apéritif all on its own."
Sierra Starr,Zinfandel,88.25,21.5,4,"This red is made from 70% Merlot, with smaller additions of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Eucalyptus and bay laurel dominate on the nose, as thick tannins resolve softly in the glass. Peppercorn, licorice and black cherry combine to offer big flavor and length, making way for a powerful finish."
Sierra Vista,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,30.0,1,"This wine hails from a variety of Dutton family vineyards, many of them popular vineyard designates of their own. Together they show a deftness of blending, offering bright acidity within a lighthearted context of licorice and wild strawberry. The juicy core is further embellished in huckleberry and blueberry, finishing in a mild hit of nutmeg."
Sierra Vista,Syrah,88.0,32.0,1,"This powerful blend of Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is smoky with oak and thickly concentrated on the palate, with sweet blueberry fruit and dark chocolate flavors. Round and rich, it has moderate acidity."
Sightglass,Chardonnay,91.0,22.0,1,"This fairly limited production, single-vineyard effort was barrel fermented, and shows aromatic notes of popcorn, toast and grassy citrus. The fruit mixes oranges and apples, and the wine has a nice balance with ample acidity."
Sigillo Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,32.0,1,"Concentrated cassis and black plum aromas meet pepper, tar and pressed violet notes on the nose of this bottling. The well-structured palate is fresh and floral, with peppery spice, tart blackberry flavors and sticky tannins, but is very reserved at this stage of its life."
Signaterra Benziger,Pinot Noir,89.0,49.0,1,"Aromas of spice, macerated cherry, vanilla and blackberry lead to jammy, sweet-seeming fruit flavors. It provides easy-drinking appeal, with grainy tannins backing it all up."
Signorello,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,90.0,2,"Aromas of plum, stewed cherry, milk chocolate and vanilla are accented by notes of smoke. Fruit and barrel flavors intertwine on the palate, with fruit winning out on the finish that narrows a bit."
Signorello,Chardonnay,89.0,80.0,2,"Aromas seem a bit locked up, with notes of plum, herb and cedar. The raspberry flavors similarly seem bunched up, with lightly dry tannins providing support. Vanilla flavors linger on the finish. The variety gets a bit lost."
Signorello,Pinot Noir,90.33,63.33,3,"This wine starts off with a broad blend of berries and cherries, and well-integrated, smooth tannins. But in the finish and aftertaste, a chemical bitterness emerges and persists."
Signorello,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,70.0,1,"It's rare to see a varietal bottle of Petit Verdot come out of this appellation, let alone a single vineyard offering but this one clearly deserves it. The aromas of flowers, soil, green herbs and purple fruit are light and brooding and lead to full but in balance black-fruit flavors. A lengthy finish caps it off."
Signorello,Syrah,88.0,90.0,1,This matches deep purple fruits to aggressive herb and stem flavors. The impression is that some percentage of whole clusters were included in the ferment. This definitely needs extra bottle age—put it away till 2020.
Silenus,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,100.0,1,"This vineyard selection captures the defining character of this tiny AVA—an underlying streak of gun metal, and an overall austerity that belies the complexity and subtle length of the wine. Tart cranberry fruit brings supporting acidity, and the wine rewards your attention with extra length and detail. Drink 2018 to 2028."
Silk Oak,Zinfandel,87.0,15.0,1,"This is the estate vineyard, and really shines in this excellent vintage. Flavors of strawberry pastry filling come up just short of jammy, while the aging for 18+ months in new and neutral oak brings accents of toast and vanilla. It has the stuffing to age nicely over the next six to eight years."
Sill Family,Chardonnay,89.0,65.0,1,"An inviting plum color, this continues with plummy fruit, accented with tart flavors of Meyer lemon, Satsuma mandarin and nectarine. Fermented on the skins for a full week, then aged in neutral French barrels, it exhibits a discreet suggestion of toast as it winds down. An all-around excellent bottle of rosé, with the body and power to accompany a winter's roast chicken."
Siltstone,Pinot Gris,87.33,15.0,3,"Tightly wound on the nose, this wine eventually releases blackcurrant and blueberry fruit along with aromas of black rock and turned earth. The palate is dense with black peppercorn, char and asphalt, lifted by hints of violet. Since the structure is dense and tannic, it will be fun to watch this wine emerge over the years."
Siltstone,Pinot Noir,87.0,32.0,1,This is from a recently planted block at the Freedom Hill vineyard. Bright fresh fruit flavors of berry and plum set up a substantial midpalate. There's a touch of caramel from aging in one-quarter new French oak. This will benefit from further bottle age. Drink 2018 through 2022.
Silvan Ridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,83.0,24.0,2,"From all-estate fruit, this dives into experimentation with 85% whole cluster fermentation and native yeast. The results are mixed, giving herbal and white pepper accents to the bright red-berry flavors, but putting a bitter edge on the tannins. A couple more years of bottle age would be a good idea. It's too young to show its best at the moment."
Silvan Ridge,Muscat,85.0,14.0,2,"Robust tannin surrounds meaty, savory leather in this well-made red, blended with 11% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dried plum and tobacco accent pretty wisps of wild violet, making for a wine that's as perfumed as it is delicious."
Silvan Ridge,Pinot Gris,87.0,22.0,1,"Aromatic with pepper and fresh-cut tobacco, well defined by herbal fruits and leafy tannins, this single-vineyard Malbec is stylish and balanced. What is missing is depth, but the balance and length are just right, and the wine does not overreach."
Silvan Ridge,Pinot Noir,86.43,33.43,7,"Roughly half of this is Barbera, the rest Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. The Cab firms up the tannins, but the fruit lacks substance and depth, and the chocolaty oak does not add much interest."
Silvan Ridge,Sparkling Blend,88.0,16.0,1,"This is a pleasantly fruity wine, with tangy cherry fruit limned with some herbal, earthy tannins. Hints of tobacco and vanilla are there, but the wine quickly shows rather harsh, chalky acids that descend into a bitter, herbal finish."
Silvan Ridge,Syrah,85.0,20.0,1,"Though labeled reserve, this is barely distinguishable from the winery's regular Cabernet. More toast, and a little chocolate is showing, but the fruit flavors—pale blackberry and black currant—are quickly covered up by the aggressive tannins."
Silvan Ridge,Viognier,83.0,18.0,2,"Inspired by co-winemaker Eli Parker's trips to Australia, this is simply a fun and tasty sparkling red, with rose, clove, black plum, and graphite notes on the nose. Ripe berry flavors round out the palate, but tangy plum skins and a slate-driven mineral tension keep it serious."
Silver,Pinot Noir,93.5,50.5,2,"Plush blackberry, fennel, mocha, char and peppercorn aromas show on the nose of this bottling from longtime friends Paul Quinn and James Schreiner. Dried plum skin, cherry and elderberry flavors show on the palate, which is layered with tannins and turns savory with charred beef, charcoal and tobacco flavors."
Silver,Red Blend,90.0,35.0,2,"Stewed black plum and tangy black cherry fruit meet baking spice and cola on the nose of this bottling from Lompoc-based Brian Loring. The palate is tangy with black cherry and cranberry, with a touch of herbs and forest floor."
Silver,Syrah,92.0,32.0,1,"This lush, toasty, vividly fruity wine can't miss with a wide variety of seafood, pasta and poultry dishes. There's plenty of acid under full-bodied apple and melon and peach fruit. The acids carry a nice touch of citrus and that clean fresh fruit continues on through a medium-long finish."
Silver Lake,Cabernet Sauvignon,83.67,22.67,3,"One of Saintsbury's veteran winemakers, Mr. Knuttel displays his love and understanding of the variety with this sexy, spicy single-vineyard wine. Baked cherry and a hint of smoke ride a soft, medium-bodied wave of strawberry flavor with fresh acidity."
Silver Lake,Chardonnay,87.0,9.0,1,"Winemaker Sabrine Rodem strips wines down to their essence in her Ex Anima line, showing the savory side of this cool-climate Syrah. Black peppercorn, rosemary, cola and blueberry aromas show on the nose, while the palate packs cracked pepper, ripe olallieberry and dried beef flavors with tarry tension."
Silver Lake,Merlot,81.0,17.0,1,"Smoky cranberry and pomegranate feature prominently in this medium-bodied, delicately crafted wine. It shows a hint of burnt orange spiked with clove."
Silver Lake,Pinot Gris,83.0,15.0,1,This affordable wine offers tangy oak and tannin along with vibrant red fruit. Leather and juicy black plum add to its soft layers of flavor.
Silver Lake,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,19.0,1,"Medium-bodied and moderate in acidity, this earthy exploration of clove, cardamom and strawberry-rhubarb is complemented by a depth of black tea flavor. A well-composed, structured wine, it stays bright and fresh on the finish."
Silver Lake,Syrah,82.0,17.0,1,"Produced from a single clone—Dijon 777—this late release has a hint of leather around candied cherry fruit, mixed with sweetened cranberry. It's concentrated and rounded off, with brown spice highlights. Drink now to 2020."
Silver Mountain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,35.0,2,"This blend of 75% Grenache, 15% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre offers intriguing cherry candy, rhubarb and hibiscus scents, with touches of exotic cinnamon and woodsmoke. Caramel and baked cherry flavors mark the cherry pie-like palate, dusted with star anise and clove over a solidly tannic frame."
Silver Mountain,Pinot Noir,90.25,36.75,8,"Rich and aromatic, this black label reserve displays excellent power and concentration. A dense core of cassis, licorice and espresso is brightened with vivid acidity, slowing fading through a long, smoky finish. Wait until 2016 for optimum enjoyment."
Silver Spur,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,30.0,1,"Ferguson is L'Ecole's newest estate vineyard, and this Bordeaux-style blend marks its single-vineyard debut. It's 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Franc, grown at 1,500 feet in almost pure basalt. The minerality is a signature trait, along with raspberry, cassis and wild cherry fruit flavors. This seems sure to improve by 2020–2022."
Silver Trident,Pinot Noir,90.0,28.0,1,"A nose of baked apple and saline minerality introduce this wine from this single-vineyard superstar winery. The palate picks up with zing, offering apple candy, lemon lime soda and a bit of bitter tension as well. The wine evolves steadily while on the tongue and is never boring."
Silver Trident,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,28.0,2,"Testarossa's single-vineyard expertise shines on this wine from Rosella's, which is fresh and alive on the nose with ripe nectarine and grapefruit peel. The acidity carries prominently on the palate, but the ruby-red grapefruit elements are not sharp, possessing both sweet and savory sides and finishing with some bitterness. Serve with honey-glazed seared scallops."
Silverado,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.78,87.22,9,"“Califa” is a Native American word meaning the prettiest one, and that's what winemaker Fintan du Fresne delivers in this estate-grown wine. The lovely nose is spun tightly around citrus, white roses and limestone, while the well-integrated palate offers a touch of jasmine followed by apple elements that arise in the midpalate. Serve with shrimp paella."
Silverado,Chardonnay,89.0,28.0,3,"This blend is made with 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot—all Conner Lee fruit. Firm and supple, it's loaded with raspberry and cherry fruit that goes deep and stays balanced. One-quarter new French oak was used."
Silverado,Merlot,86.0,35.0,2,"This bottling slips in many corners of the flavor experience at once. On the nose, a bit of tropical fruit mixes with evenly spread buttercream, followed by precursor hints of bright acidity on the palate. That citrus-led vibrancy does come, as does a mix of creaminess and limestone-inflected tang, as if the rocks themselves delivered the acidity."
Silverado,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,22.0,2,"Winemakers James Ontiveros and Paul Wilkins tease awesomeness out of the legendary Bien Nacido Vineyard with this Pinot Noir—and Ontiveros should know how, since he worked for the vineyard for years. On the nose, there's sea salt, caramel, cotton candy and pepper-teriyaki steak. Although it's leaner on the palate, it still features ripe raspberries, milk chocolate and sweetened coffee."
Silverback,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,105.0,1,"This is Langetwins's first vintage of Malbec from estate vineyards and it leaves a bit to be desired. Flat and a tad watery, it's a one-dimensional quaff."
Silverback,Syrah,95.0,240.0,1,"Software developer-turned-vintner Mike Officer comes south from his Sonoma base to Monterey make this lavish Syrah that shows layers of blueberry, blackberry and black cassis as well as potpourri and ganache elements. Those same fruits hit the sip too, along with licorice, pretty purple flowers and an ever-increasing asphalt component."
Silvertip,Pinot Noir,89.0,32.0,1,"Rich, round and ripe, this is made from a musqué clone originally from Dijon, France, meant to impart memorable aromatics. It does, in spades, revealing wafts of honeysuckle and fresh pineapple amid a bright, tangy twist of acidity and gravely minerality, sharing a touch of salt on the finish."
Simi,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,38.0,1,"This is a new wine from this winery—its first foray onto Red Mountain. The aromas are bright, with fruit-filled notes of cherry, berry and spice in addition to a meat and mineral undertone. The flavors are dense, rich and opulent while still staying in balance. A lick of firm tannins backs it all up."
Simi,Chardonnay,84.0,26.0,1,"An assertive and mouthfilling wine, this has a relatively light color. Aromas are on the earthy side, but the flavors are ripe and focused on cherries and berries with deeper hints of clove and coriander. It's full bodied, plush in texture and long on the finish."
Simi,Rosé,85.5,22.5,2,"The aromas are all high toned, with notes of mortared fresh herbs, blueberry pie, citrus, black pepper and whiffs of smoked meat. The palate is dense and rich, tightly focused and flavorful with a meaty streak that runs throughout and a finish that lingers."
Simple Machine,Rhône-style White Blend,87.0,28.0,1,"Though from a cool region, this is a more powerful style of Syrah, showing elegant fudge and caramel notes as well as blackberries, blueberries, espresso cream and strong cola aromas. Tangy black currant and baked black-cherry fruit pop on the palate, along with tobacco, smoked beef and baking spice."
Simple Machine,Syrah-Grenache,87.0,34.0,1,"From the producer's estate vineyard on the Vaca Mountain range, this wine offers soft, generous tannin around a juicy core of cassis, dried currant, leather and cigar. Full bodied and robustly crafted, it benefits from a balance of bright acidity. It will be enjoyed further with age; drink now through 2023."
Sinclair Estate Vineyards,Red Blend,90.0,41.25,4,"Ripe aromas of lemon curd, almond and butter make for a showy intro to the nose of this wine, but it is quickly focused by sharper pear and pineapple fruit. The rich palate shows all the classic Cali Chardonnay components of butter, cooked apple and crushed cashew, all expertly measured and in balance."
Sineann,Cabernet Franc,92.0,48.0,2,"Dusty blackberry and juicy clove mark this softly textured, earthy and layered red wine. Full bodied without being bodacious, it instead offers the classic richness and reward of the appellation from a great site in a great vintage."
Sineann,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.67,58.0,6,"Pressed boysenberry aromas highlight simultaneously dark and fresh fruit on the nose of this bottling by Adam Lee, which also conveys Earl Grey tea, lavender, hibiscus and crushed pencils. The palate picks up the same tack, offering delicate fruits and florals, from cranberry to elderflower."
Sineann,Gewürztraminer,89.0,18.0,5,"The aromas draw you in with complex notes of chamomile, almond butter, herb and citrus. The palate shows depth and vibrant texture, exhibiting poise and exquisite balance. It delivers."
Sineann,Grenache,87.0,24.0,1,"This is a dynamic wine, showing Key lime, yellow apples, oak smoke, butter, tangerine pith, macadamia nut and sea salt on the nose. The palate is streamlined with lime pith, lemon rind and seared pineapple flavors."
Sineann,Merlot,91.5,32.5,2,"The duel in this wine is between equal parts Zinfandel and Syrah, a winning combination in its thick, firm tannin weight wrapped around bright red fruit. Tangy acidity gives it a lift along a juicy and sophisticated palate, peppery and alive on the finish."
Sineann,Petit Verdot,91.67,44.0,3,"Coffee, spice, vanilla and pencil lead aromas are followed by rich, luscious, full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. It's hedonistic and pulls no punches but shows balance: an equal mix of fruit and barrel."
Sineann,Pinot Gris,89.0,20.0,1,"Delicate aromas of lemon blossom, ripe Asian pear and a touch of yellow melon show on the nose of this versatile and tasty bottling. Grippy tension consumes the palate, led by lemon rind, but there's also a richer yellow-apple and pear core as well as a bit of pineapple."
Sineann,Pinot Noir,91.94,41.33,18,"Slightly reductive in style, this wine shows aromas of lime skins and Brie-cheese rind before opening a bit toward lemon blossoms and raw cashews. The palate possesses a stunningly grippy and chalky texture, with sharp flavors of Key-lime rind and pomelo pith."
Sineann,Red Blend,88.0,21.33,6,"A light toasty, meaty aroma and savory flavors help this wine stand out from the pack. Full bodied, it's well structured due to firm tannins and acidity. It should be best after 2018."
Sineann,Riesling,88.0,18.0,1,"From the estate vineyard of a winery founded in 1994 by Silicon Valley mogul TJ Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor, the grapes must be picked by a special tractor-on-wires because they are so steeply planted. Like the other 2009s, this Pinot Noir is characterized by strong tannins, meaning that it will last. Unlike the others, this one boats a more mushroom-driven nose between shiitake and porcini, with a touch of mocha. The palate reveals caramelized raspberry, graphite and silty flavors."
Sineann,Zinfandel,92.5,38.5,6,"A new cuvée for this winery, this is an equal mix of 30% Merlot, Cab Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon; plus 10% Petite Sirah. It offers generous and juicy pie fruit flavors of berry and cherry. The acidity, tannins and lightly tasted herbal notes are in perfect proportion. On balance it's a fruit-packed little gem that is immensely enjoyable."
Sinor-LaVallee,Chardonnay,92.0,38.0,1,"100% varietal from one of Washington's most esteemed vineyards, it's tightly wound and slow to reveal its charms. Notes of clove, woodspice, raspberry and cherry re supported by firm, slightly dry tannins that need time to soften."
Sinor-LaVallee,Pinot Noir,92.33,38.67,3,"Pinot Noir specialist Norm Yost hits the varietal's geeky purists with a straight clonal take, pulling just Clone 2A to deliver this wine. The nose is lighter, with cranberry, leather, butter, vanilla and root beer aromas. Meanwhile the palate is stronger—soft but a tad tannic on entry, with licorice and charred pepper steak on the finish. Equally elegant and forceful."
Sinor-LaVallee,Syrah,91.0,48.33,3,"A vibrant minerality consumes the aromas on this bottling from an extremely coastal vineyard. On the palate, strawberry and sagebrush flavors emerge, all couched in a clean, crisp and refreshing acidity with appropriate bitterness as well. Ready to drink now."
Siren Song,Rosé,86.0,25.0,1,"There's a slightly pink hue to this wine from Lompoc's Norman Yost. The nose is bright and minerally, with strawberry, apple cider and slight watermelon aromas. There's even more going on once sipped, with pear spritzer and citrus zest playing along with gray rocks and elements both bitter and sour. It's a refreshing take on a grape that doesn't always get the rock star treatment."
Siren Song,Sparkling Blend,89.0,45.0,1,"Made with 54% Merlot and 46% Cabernet Franc, it spent 23 months in one-third new French oak. The overall structure is impressive, with firm acidity and streaks of iron and mineral around tight, taut black fruit. It will get even better with ample breathing time and/or further cellaring."
Siskiyou Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,15.0,1,"There's a fascinating presence of herb-roasted chicken to the well-balanced nose of this Chardonnay from the historic Brousseay Vineyard, alongside chalky minerality, golden apple and Asian pear. Once sipped, it's very easy on the palate, with baked apple, wet stone, slight kiwi and a noticeable salinity."
Siskiyou Vineyards,White Blend,86.0,10.0,1,"For the first time these excellent grapes are being shown in a single-vineyard cuvée. It's a big, tannic, high-octane wine, with smooth, ripe and generous purple fruits. There is plenty of supporting acid, along with rather astringent tannins that carry a leafy note through the finish. Drink now–2019."
Sisters Forever,Chardonnay,87.0,15.0,1,"Attractive oaky, well-aged aromas and flavors make this wine mellow and multi-faceted. It leads with cedar and cigar-box aromas, followed by touches of cherry and plum. The body is full, adding to the moderately tannic texture."
Site,Grenache,93.0,50.0,1,"Pale peach in color, this wine offers bright notes of watermelon and cherry. It drinks a hair or two off dry, with plentiful juicy fruit flavors."
Site,Rhône-style Red Blend,93.0,50.0,1,"Aromas like white pepper and dried herbs lead to ripe, direct fruit flavors and a feeling of power from the very full body."
Site,Roussanne,90.0,40.0,1,"The aromas of jasmine and stone fruit seem quite subdued for the variety. As promised, the palate boasts plentiful amounts of sugar counterbalanced by stone-fruit flavors."
Site,Syrah,93.0,50.0,2,"Aromas of citrus rind, baking spice and baked bread fill the aromas. The palate is tart with lively fruit flavors."
Site,Viognier,92.0,40.0,1,"Although the 2010 vintage was cooler than the previous two years, this Chardonnay still offers rich and luscious notes of crème caramel and baked pear. The intoxicating bouquet picks up layers of lemon zest and mineral."
Sivas-Sonoma,Zinfandel,86.67,23.0,3,"Stiff and tannic, this wine's bold black-cherry flavor, which is characteristic of the Champoux Vineyard, is veined with iron and gravel notes, plus a clover hint. It's complex and riveting, and the tannins finish with a peppery bite."
Six Prong,Red Blend,85.0,15.0,1,"Focus and elegance are the hallmarks of this wine, and it offers the fruit purity that characterizes virtually all of Maison Bleue's white wines. From the first sniff to the last, resonating swallow, this smells and tastes like a bowl full of peaches, pineapples and mixed stone fruits. It's tight and defined, and it doesn't have new oak influence."
Sixto,Chardonnay,92.2,48.0,5,"In 2008, Januik made a single-vineyard Syrah from Lewis Vineyard fruit; now the winery has sourced fruit from Ciel du Cheval Vineyard, one of the superstar spots on Red Mountain. A compact wine that snaps right into focus, this offers varietal flavors of fig, berry and plum. A streak of smooth chocolate weaves through the finish, along with a hint of red licorice and underlying slate-like minerality."
Skinner,Grenache,88.0,28.0,1,"Made from 75% Chardonnay and 25% Viognier, Una is thick in caramel and vanilla tones throughout. It conveys a distinct taste and aroma of burnt sugar, like pecans roasting over an open fire. Complex, it works as a well-adjusted, finely made sweet wine, ready to be paired with fruity desserts."
Skinner,Mourvèdre,92.0,58.0,1,"This wine explores the variety's savory side, with aromas of fresh herbs, green pepper and dried tobacco followed by flowers and cherry. It brings suppleness and richness of flavor but also exceptionally well-balanced acidity with length to match, with cedar notes on the finish."
Skinner,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.4,28.8,5,"Cabernet Sauvignon (71%) makes up the majority of this blend, which also includes Merlot (25%) and pinches of Malbec and Petit Verdot. Complex aromas of potting soil, green pepper, graphite, herbs, blackberry, licorice and barrel spices are followed by focused black-fruit flavors with light coffee accents."
Skinner,Rhône-style White Blend,93.0,26.0,2,"This is a Merlot-dominant blend, with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc blended in. It offers cooler-climate elements of dried herb, cedar and currant, with the tannins sleek and polished. The finish flirts with a taste of coconut. Drink now through 2021."
Skinner,White Blend,91.0,23.0,2,"Aromas convey cedar, savory herb, earth, black licorice and cherry. The dark flavors are reserved in style but still display richness, supported by fine-grained tannins."
Skinner,Zinfandel,90.0,36.0,2,"From four of the producer's vineyards, this is a sublimely layered and intriguing wine, pretty and floral on the nose in citrus peel and jasmine. Weighty and plush on the palate, it traffics in caramel and honey, settling into harmony on the lengthy finish. Drink now through 2021."
Skyline Wines,White Blend,87.0,18.0,1,"It's rare to find a pure varietal example that all comes from a single site. This one offers aromas of flowers, moist soil, purple fruit and exotic spice followed by a dense, almost impenetrable palate that offers freshness and length. It's a standout example of the variety."
Skylite,Merlot,84.0,24.0,1,"From the winery that first popularized Petite Sirah in California, this vintage has vivid black-pepper aromas and a deep, inky color. Rich and concentrated flavors suggest pomegranate juice, blackberries and clove. Lavish and layered tannins give the texture an almost thick viscosity that coats the mouth for a lasting impression."
Sleeping Giant,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,80.0,1,"This new cuvée features grapes from both Tokar and Yellowbird vineyards, located out in the Mill Creek region east of downtown Walla Walla. It's close enough to the Blue Mountains to allow for this experiment in dry-farmed (non-irrigated) grapes. Flavors are distinctive, showing wild berries, cola, grain and herb."
Sleeping Giant,Chardonnay,91.5,45.0,4,"Sobon's Old Vines Zinfandel is seamless in bright red fruit and soft tannins, with a tempered spiciness on the finish. A great value and go-to wine for a crowd, this is ideal to stock up on for outdoor gatherings, or just to get through the winter."
Sleight of Hand,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,39.67,9,"An intriguing combination of almost equal parts Malbec, Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot, Rock Wall's Romancer hails from Clarksburg's small Heringer Vineyard, and is bright, fruity and juicy with blackberry and strawberry flavors. Aromatic lavender and jasmine notes against a backdrop of meaty tobacco make the presence of Mourvedre apparent."
Sleight of Hand,Cabernet Franc,89.5,18.0,2,"A well-made Cabernet, with additions of Merlot and Malbec contributing to the blend. It shows mixed herb and plenty of spice up front, with red berry fruits following. The tannins have been smoothed out a bit, but retain some texture and herbal highlights."
Sleight of Hand,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.67,52.0,3,"A rich, concentrated Livermore Valley Bordeaux blend, comprised of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon and lesser percentages of Petit Verdot, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. This vintage of Supremacy has a big presence, smelling of earth and cinnamon, a layering of blackberry and chocolate lingering in the background. A wine with great texture and mellowing tannins ready to drink now or in 5–7 years."
Sleight of Hand,Chardonnay,89.83,28.0,6,"This is an equal split of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Medium bodied, it's peppery in cassis, cedar, cinnamon and vanilla. Big, pillowy tannins fill the palate, staying firm and sizable through the finish."
Sleight of Hand,Grenache,92.0,60.0,1,"This well-priced bottling offers Italian herbs on the nose, from oregano to marjoram, alongside tart red cherries, dried tobacco, cola and a touch of smoke. Graphite minerality frames the sip, which shows red cherries cooked with thyme and bay leaf as well as rustic sagebrush. It's complex, tense and lingering."
Sleight of Hand,Red Blend,89.75,36.25,4,"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (65%) and Barbera. Cranberry, raspberry and baking spice aromas are followed by generous tart fruit flavors with an electric jolt of acid. The acid is quite bracing to have on its own. Pair it with pasta with a red sauce."
Sleight of Hand,Riesling,89.83,18.0,6,"Aromas of caramel, coffee bean and assorted blue fruit are in the lead, with cinnamon notes providing accents. The palate is full flavored yet restrained, with smoked meat and olive flavors that glide on the finish."
Sleight of Hand,Rosé,90.0,18.0,1,"This is a big, bold wine, full bodied with leathery tannin heat and a generous expression of blackberry and black-cherry cola. A touch of vanilla adds to the plushness and approachability."
Sleight of Hand,Syrah,91.55,46.82,11,"While full bodied and plush, this vineyard-designate, named for original owner Judy Jordan's daughter, brightens the palate with cranberry and rhubarb. It shows high acidity and a leanness of texture that makes the wine seem lighter than it is, a nice mix of power and grace with a lingering hit of spice on the finish."
Sleight of Hand,White Blend,90.0,17.0,1,"This blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Syrah and 4% Cabernet Franc shows smashed blueberries and blackcurrant on the nose alongside dried dill, pencil lead, cola and beef char. The palate is frame by judicious acidity and strong graphite flavors, with bright cherry and tart dark cranberry fruit, lifted by smoke and black pepper."
Small Vines,Chardonnay,93.5,63.5,2,"Merlot (59%) takes the lead on this blend, which is balanced out by Cabernet Franc. Intriguing aromas of herbs, flowers, spice raspberries, café au lait and barrel spices lead to silky, polished fruit and barrel flavors that linger."
Small Vines,Pinot Noir,91.67,71.56,9,"This wine is a unique blend of Tempranillo (62%), Graciano, Cabernet, Merlot and Garnacha. Spice, coffee, tobacco, vanilla and red-fruit aromas are followed by a smooth, elegant palate, with flavors that linger."
Small and Tall,Pinot Noir,93.0,54.0,2,"Made in an assertive, firmly tannic style without being too high in alcohol, the reserve-tier wine from one of the oldest wineries in California layers spicy, toasty oak flavors from French and American barrels over a base of ripe cherry. A bold wine for a bold meal. This should age well; perhaps best from 2015–2020."
Smasne Cellars,Grenache,90.0,30.0,1,"Bone dry and concentrated, it was fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral oak. Lush floral and citrus aromatics carry over into the flavors, with a streak of Curaçao liqueur as well."
Smasne Cellars,Malbec,86.0,32.0,1,"Chalk Line includes all five Bordeaux grapes along with 25% Syrah. The first sniff brings up generous red and purple fruit aromas and pretty, yet restrained, barrel toast. It's well-integrated with medium density and excellent balance."
Smasne Cellars,Morio Muskat,90.0,16.0,1,"You'd never guess that this was rocking it so hard with 16.3% alcohol, as this wine achieves balance in the face of such boozy contents. The nose holds a blackberry core with rusty, spicier edges of star anise. These are followed by a palate of black cherry and cedar, with enough tannins to ensure evolving drinking until at least 2018."
Smasne Cellars,Petit Verdot,88.0,35.0,1,"Full-flavored and textured, probably from the use of a Sauvignon Musque Clone for half of the wine, this is nonetheless a light wine, subtle in stone fruit, kiwi and lemon-lime. The acidity has an electricity and bubbliness that almost make it come alive. It's the right wine for fresh-shucked oysters."
Smasne Cellars,Red Blend,90.0,34.5,2,"This tasty, toasty red wine is all Sangiovese. The tangy red berry fruit flavors carry highlights of peppery herbs. With some air time the wine smoothes out and rolls into a creamy, mocha-infused finish."
Smasne Cellars,Syrah,89.0,32.0,1,"Honeycrisp apples come to mind at first sip, along with dollops of peach, lemongrass and caramel. The mouthfeel is fresh and flavorful, with excellent texture and length."
Smith & Hook,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,65.0,1,"Hailing from a hillside estate of hand-tended grapes, this traditional Bordeaux blend begins with a menthol, roasted fennel and cinnamon-touched nose. On the palate, the herbals continue alongside ripening plum and gingerbread cake, followed by a lingering finish."
Smith & Hook,Red Blend,90.0,25.0,2,"A five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend, it's still a big, tough, chewy, tannic wine with a chunky, somewhat blocky mouthfeel. Cherry, cassis and wood flavors dominate, and the tannins are quite astringent. Re-tasted over many hours it remained stubbornly hard and compact. Give this one some further bottle age."
Smith Wooton,Cabernet Franc,87.0,40.0,1,"From the famous Westside Road-adjacent vineyard, this Chardonnay shows a proclivity toward lush roundness of texture and tropical flourish in flavor. Vanilla nuttiness is complemented by pineapple, green apple and caramel, lasting long into the finish."
Smith-Madrone,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,50.0,1,"From a vineyard tucked into the heart of the appellation, this bottling is hearty but not overripe, offering brawny black cherry, gingersnap, clove and crushed graphite scents on the nose. Subtle eucalyptus flavor leads the palate, crescendoing into warmer red cherry and baked cranberry notes, followed by licorice and thyme, and culminating in a vanilla -laced finish."
Smith-Madrone,Chardonnay,92.0,32.0,1,"The aromas on this widely available Delicato Family bottling—nectarine, chamomile and chalk—are subtle but approachable. It's well hewn on the palate, with touches of butter, baking spice, poached Asian pear and wafts of smoke."
Smith-Madrone,Riesling,93.0,27.0,1,"The first Syrah in an expanding lineup of Tranche estate wines from the Blue Mountain Vineyard, this exceptional effort hews to a European style despite its substantial alcohol. Initially dark and smoky, hinting at streaks of herb and showing compact berry fruit flavors, it broadens out and expands aromatically, weaving in highlights of cured meats, bacon and clean earth. Just a dollop of herb and stem adds further interest, in a wine that retains its elegance along with exceptional power."
Sno Road,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.5,63.0,2,"A pure varietal blend from the estate vineyard, this has everything you look for in Walla Walla Syrah—black fruits, loam, graphite, balsamic—and an inviting scent of orange liqueur. Licorice, iron and a concentrated, muscular depth elevate the finish."
Sno Road,Tempranillo,85.0,24.0,1,"Full in the mouth, rich with a mix of pastry fruits, fruitcake, baking spices, clove and coffee, this decadent pleasure is like drinking a Christmas cake. Raisins soaked in a Bourbon sauce come to mind, along with plum pudding."
Snoqualmie,Cabernet Merlot,86.0,10.0,1,"This Oregon winery sources fruit for its Proprietary Red from top Washington vineyards on Red Mountain, in Walla Walla and in the Horse Heaven Hills. Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (it could be labeled as such), it packs its rich raspberry, blueberry and black currant fruit into a precisely-defined, balanced and persistent wine with plenty of power."
Snoqualmie,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.91,17.0,11,"Creamy vanilla and spritzy acidity surround a ripe core of baked apple and pear in this white. Full-bodied and touched by oak, it finishes clean and concentrated."
Snoqualmie,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,87.0,10.0,1,"Black pepper, graphite and reluctant boysenberry notes balance the rubbery funk on the nose of this cool-climate Syrah. It's fairly light on the palate, with just-ripe boysenberry and chopped Italian herbs."
Snoqualmie,Chardonnay,85.5,12.5,2,"Spicy purple fruits come up quickly, followed by flavors of leaf, earth and stem. Tannins are tight and slightly coarse, and it ends suddenly."
Snoqualmie,Gewürztraminer,83.0,13.0,1,"A remarkably juicy, berry, cherry Zin that's fully in balance and easy to drink, not to mention a great price."
Snoqualmie,Merlot,86.0,17.5,2,"Clean and fresh, from a Royal Slope vineyard, showing white peach fruit with a pleasing hint of fresh herb. The acids are proportionate, and the mouthfeel offers a palate- cleansing wash of minerality."
Snoqualmie,Red Blend,85.75,10.0,4,"Nicely structured, with citrus fruits (lemon, lime, pink grapefruit) displayed against stiffer flavors of skin. There is a hint of residual sugar, and the alcohol is just under 13%, but the overall impression is a dry, tight style with little or no floral character."
Snoqualmie,Riesling,86.75,9.12,8,"This is the winery's budget offering. It shows modest varietal flavors, with a slight burned or roasted character."
Snoqualmie,Syrah,84.0,23.0,1,"A blend of Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel, Vezer's Jake's has a good, dark earthy personality, with a depth of spice around its big shoulders and dusty Petite Sirah finish."
Snowden,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,54.0,2,"This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years."
Snowden,Merlot,91.0,86.0,1,"A fine follow-up to Seia's inaugural 2004 Clifton Hill, this again delivers ripe, concentrated flavors of plum and berry, lifted with citrus and finishing with a hint of mint. Despite the high (15.3%) alcohol, it is clean and bracing, with natural acids and very little heat in the finish. As young as it is, it hits a bit of a dead spot in the back, but it has the stuffing (and the pedigree) that would suggest that with a few years of cellaring it will open out and show more of the herb and smoked meat character that is lurking just below the surface."
SoDo,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,18.0,1,"Quite thin, as if over-cropped, turning the fruit generic. Then it brings in a honey character, as if it were botrytis-affected. But it is not a sweet or late harvest wine; it's quite dry."
SoDo,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,15.0,1,"The aromas bring spicy notes of cayenne pepper, along with notes of dark-roasted coffee, wood spice and cherry. The palate is full of polished yet voluptuous dark-fruit flavors that are backed by lightly grainy tannins."
SoDo,Rosé,90.0,15.0,1,"This rosé is a field blend of Mourvèdre and Grenache. A very pretty pale-peach color, the aromas bring pleasing notes of herb, spice, strawberry, passion fruit and mineral. The flavors are dry and full in feel, showing weight and intensity but still a sense of lightness."
Sobon Estate,Petite Sirah,93.0,24.0,1,"This small-production, vineyard-designate is impressive in dried cherry and raspberry layers of flavor, supported by integrated oak. Juicy and explosive on the palate, it offers a spicy forest-floor note that complements the fruit."
Sobon Estate,Primitivo,86.67,24.0,3,"Made from nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this adds a handful of Petit Verdot for good measure. Smooth, round and approachable, it offers a powerful grip and dense black fruit, finishing with balanced acidity."
Sobon Estate,Rosé,86.0,11.0,1,"Pear compote is lightly spiced in nutmeg in this full-bodied, creamy white, buzzy in acidity and a stony minerality that presents as tightly woven texture on the palate. Refreshingly balanced, it offers length and breadth as it nears the finish."
Sobon Estate,Tannat,88.0,24.0,2,"Pale peach in color, the aromas bring bright notes of passion fruit, guava and strawberry. It drinks dry, but with plenty of kiwi and other tropical-fruit flavors bringing a sense of sweetness. Distinctly fruit forward for a rosé, it delivers a lot of appeal, despite occasionally seeming a bit weighty."
Sobon Estate,Zinfandel,87.67,18.14,21,"This is the first Chenin Blanc from this up-and-coming winery. All native yeast fermented and aged in stainless steel, the aromas pop, with notes of pear, apple, lees and melon. Sleek in style, it brings a sense of brightness and purity of flavor and bright acids. Very varietally correct, it's a compelling example of Chenin in the state. Pair it with food to see it at its best."
Sodaro,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,60.0,1,"A Bordeaux-style blend from the iconic Red Mountain site, this is precisely structured with black fruits, zippy acidity and a tight focus. The pinpoint construction suggests that this is cellarable until 2024 at least, and will continue to improve for years before settling into maturity."
Sodaro,Cabernet Blend,90.5,95.0,2,"Windy Oaks' 2012s are lighter in color than their vintage compatriots, yet not lacking in aromas, which include sage, tomato, black olive and curry. The leaner palate begins a bit light before emerging with olive tapenade and crushed herbs. It would pair well with a burger, roasted chicken, or gourmet burrito."
Sodaro,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,107.5,2,"This has fresh oak and ripe boysenberry aromas and flavors. A thick but not harsh texure wraps around the tongue and keeps the flavors lingering on the finish. It's appropriately tannic and appetizingly dry, needing rich food or a drinker who loves this kind of delicious density."
Sofia,Sparkling Blend,85.0,19.0,1,"Heady aromatics create a signature on this wine, so floral in lychee, orange blossom and lemongrass. Light and dry, it's classically varietal, with grapefruit and tangerine jockeying for attention amidst plenty of minerality."
Sojourn,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.71,105.43,7,"A mix of fruit spanning across the Russian River Valley, this complex Chardonnay is so inviting and approachable. Brimming in ripe Gravenstein apple and baking spices, it conveys alluring and lush crispness as well as balanced fruit and floral aromas."
Sojourn,Chardonnay,92.78,46.0,9,"Merlot makes up 45% of this wine, with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Sangiovese, Petit Verdot, Syrah, Zinfandel, and Tempranillo. Aromas of green herb, plum, freshly hewn wood and coffee are followed by smooth-drinking fruit and barrel flavors, with the tannins showing a touch of astringency."
Sojourn,Pinot Noir,92.55,57.82,22,"Fruity like grape jam and blackberry syrup, this is a rich, almost-sweet wine. It has a very dark color, impressive fruit concentration and a smooth texture."
Sokol Blosser,Pinot Noir,90.53,55.0,34,"A whiff of charred wood and pencil lead adds a little complexity to this otherwise straightforward, fruity and rather soft-textured wine. It is medium bodied, and the cherry and berry flavors seem to sweeten on the finish."
Sokol Blosser,White Blend,86.0,15.0,1,"A nearly dry version of Moscato, this wine drinks more like a table wine. It has good, full body, fairly deep pear and pistachio flavors, and a rich texture."
Sol Duc,Red Blend,88.0,50.0,1,"Bold and spicy, this dry wine is saturated with toasty oak and vanilla flavors over plum and prune. Made from mostly Petite Sirah and Syrah, it has medium body and a smooth texture."
Sol Stone,Sangiovese,87.0,26.0,1,"There's a pruney, dried-fruit persistence on the nose of this wine, a blend of unknown varieties. Barbecue smoke, black pepper and a high degree of ripeness combine for a mix of heat that's finalized by a vegetative note."
Solis,Barbera,90.0,25.0,2,"Baked cinnamon and cherry tart form a promising beginning into this wine, but an intrusive addition of root beer pushes it over the edge in terms of cloying flavor. The wine then becomes somewhat flimsy on the palate."
Solitary Cellars,Red Blend,89.0,28.0,1,"Slightly sour red plum, red cherry, tar and dust show on the nose of this simple wine. More tar and rubber flavors arise on the palate, where light red fruit also emerges."
Solitary Cellars,Zinfandel,89.0,27.0,1,"Barrel-fermented in entirely new Russian oak, not something one sees every day, this somewhat thin, while ripe, wine offers a curious combination of anise and ham."
Solminer,Blaufränkisch,91.5,38.0,2,"This wine comes off as quite green especially considering the variety, vintage and appellation. Aromas of bell pepper and green herbs lead to cherry and savory flavors, with the tannins bringing some heft."
Solminer,Muskat,91.0,28.0,1,"Aromas of mesquite, smoke, strawberry, freesia and herbs are followed by quite light fruit flavors. The concentration seems wanting."
Solminer,Pinot Noir,90.0,48.0,1,"Dense olallieberry and asphalt show on the nose of this bottling, as does a tart black-plum-skin scent. There is grape-like sweetness to the palate, and touches of cola, but not much else."
Solminer,Rosé,87.0,22.0,2,"Shea shows some muscle here, yet remains fruit-driven, with a lush midpalate mixing strawberry and raspberry fruit with cola/sassafras soda flavors. In keeping with Boedecker's style, this wine is extremely clean, the fruit is fresh and the flavors nicely detailed. Nothing big or over the top here, but first-class winemaking."
Solminer,Syrah,90.5,34.5,4,"Aged in neutral French oak, it has light notes of herbs, plum, pencil lead and crushed flowers. The acids are tart and racy competing with somewhat gruff tannins. Pair it with pizza or pasta with a red sauce to see it at its best."
Soléna,Merlot,87.0,32.0,1,"This wine is light cherry-red in color, showing some bricking. Strawberry, bubble gum and orange-peel aromas are followed by off-dry flavors with a broad feel."
Soléna,Pinot Noir,88.96,42.61,23,"Nearing greenish-yellow in the glass, this wine offers lemon curd, a touch of oak and a flash of white peach on the nose. Golden apple and iodine flavors show on the palate, which proves more bitter and sour than ripe."
Somerston,Cabernet Franc,93.0,90.0,1,"With 17% Cabernet Franc added in, this wine is leathery, rustic and tightly tannic, with a sizable presence of oak. Soft, it finishes in a thickness of black cherry and stewy plum."
Sonkin Cellars,Syrah,87.0,46.0,2,"Pepper, herb and dark fruit aromas lead to silky-feeling fruit and savory flavors. It doesn't stand up on its own but should fit in nicely at the dinner table."
Sonnet,Pinot Noir,91.0,40.0,3,"Ordinary, this is not. The medium-garnet color has a brownish rim. Aromas resemble black pepper and charred beef, while the flavors are mostly savory rather than fruity. The wine tastes like pomegranate juice, and feels firm and dry in the mouth."
Sonoma Collection,Chardonnay,84.0,13.0,1,"Starting out reductive, this wine has aromas of wet copper penny, fresh herbs, woodspice and dark fruit. The coffee and black fruit flavors are high octane, seeming out of balance."
Sonoma Collection,Pinot Noir,88.0,19.0,1,"Clear, well-defined varietal scents of pepper, licorice and boysenberry cut through, with a hint of fresh-cut tobacco. A substrate of granite underscores this ripe, supple, medium-long wine with good grip and a polished mouthfeel. Drink 2015 through 2020."
Sonoma Collection,Red Blend,83.5,16.0,2,"Part of the winery's line of single-clone Pinots, this is a bit chunkier than the others, with strawberries and cherries lightly finished with a milk chocolate frame. The midpalate is medium bodied and holds together through the finish."
Sonoma Creek,Zinfandel,89.0,15.0,1,"Pepper, ollallieberry, roasted pork and a violet-flavored candy aroma comprise the nose on this wine from a vineyard north of the Santa Maria Valley. Zesty acidity on the palate cuts through the boysenberry, anise and game flavors, making for a lively wine."
Sonoma-Cutrer,Chardonnay,90.0,39.67,3,"This feels a little thin at first sip, but it's balanced and shows tart cherry fruit that has attained a modest level of ripeness. It has a pleasing softness in the mouth, opening into a mix of plum and red cherry, with some phenolic bite."
Sonoma-Cutrer,Pinot Noir,88.33,47.33,3,"A strength of oak and burly black fruit in this single-vineyard designate makes it intense and big. In the background, an unexpected minty, forest floor quality overtakes the aromas at first, but blows off over time. The wine finishes as intensely as it starts, awash in toasty oak."
Sonoma-Cutrer,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,25.0,1,"Thanks to wines like this, expect a bright future for this appellation, which is just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands. Aromas of ripe plums, brown spices, turned earth and black slate lead into a silky palate, where red fruits are cut with an emergent, cinnamon-y spice and slightly leathery tannic grip."
Sonoma-Loeb,Chardonnay,90.0,32.5,4,"A scent of leathery funk inhabits this wine, yet never overtakes the balanced flavors. A mix of blueberry and cherry fills the palate with lush flavors, and highlights of coffee, mocha and salted caramel add further interest. It drinks as a more mature wine than the vintage date might suggest."
Sonoma-Loeb,Pinot Noir,90.17,43.17,6,"From a warm, ripe vintage, this reflects those characteristics with fruit-driven flavors of plum, berry and apricot. Round and full-bodied, it finishes with a lick of orange liqueur."
Sonora,Zinfandel,84.0,21.0,2,"This looks deep and dark, smells like Port and tastes almost as rich as that. However, it's dry and not too high in alcohol, although the aroma and flavor of superripe grapes is similar. While bold in flavor and relatively big in texture, it's pretty smooth overall."
Soos Creek,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.95,29.32,22,"This vineyard-designate opens with a luxurious nose of cardamom and plummy blackberry seasoned with dried herb, and is seamless and soft on the palate. An oaky swathe of tannin dominates on the finish."
Soos Creek,Cabernet Franc,91.0,30.0,2,"A tight, concentrated wine made in larger quantities than many of the producer's other Cabernets, this is approachable and medium bodied, featuring aromas and flavors of savory black tea and olive."
Soos Creek,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,33.0,2,"This full-bore wine smells like strawberries and cherries, and tastes jammy and chocolaty. The rich, almost thick texture hangs on to all that ripeness on the finish. This should pair well with salty cheeses or a chocolate dessert."
Soos Creek,Merlot,90.0,30.0,2,"A bright copper color, this is done in a French style, with an emphasis less on freshness than on more mature flavors. Impressions of rose water, cracker and orange liqueur contribute to the mix. This wine should be consumed now through 2016."
Soos Creek,Merlot-Cabernet,92.0,25.0,1,"Quite quaffable, with just a bit of sweetness, this pleasant rosé is loaded with strawberry scents and flavors of strawberry scones. It's an uncomplicated wine, perfect for a picnic, and best enjoyed well-chilled."
Soos Creek,Red Blend,91.67,33.42,12,"Sanguine in cranberry, red plum and dark cherry, this wine offers sizable tannin and oak around more savory elements of tobacco and black tea, an introduction of soy on the full-bodied finish."
Soos Creek,Syrah,90.0,25.0,2,"Cocoa, herb, cranberry and cherry aromas lead to plush-feeling coffee and black-fruit flavors that carry through the finish. It brings a whole lot of enjoyment and appeal."
Soquel Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,75.0,2,"This is a smooth, dark and rich wine, made from the heart of the appellation in an agreeable year. Balanced, it offers blackberry, cassis and a touch of silky texture, finishing with elegance."
Soquel Vineyards,Chardonnay,89.0,28.0,1,"Underripe, slightly green orange peels mix with honeydew, grass and lime on this straightforward selection. The palate shows a touch of peach on the first part of the sip before delving into pungent grassiness that continues through the finish, all complemented by a wet stone frame."
Soquel Vineyards,Pinot Noir,91.4,42.6,5,"A fruity bouquet of dark plum and blueberry is prominent in this 100% varietal wine, from a mountainous vineyard site known for tannic strength. The power is there but it's nicely managed, allowing the velvety texture and a balance of weight to shine through, topped off on the finish in dried herb."
Sorelle Winery,Barbera,85.33,25.0,3,"Jasmine and lychee form the basis of this wine's bouquet, with fresh-cut peach making for a delicious experience on the palate. Rich, dense and lengthy, it comes from a cool vineyard site that provides lots of natural minerality and a taste of wet stone."
Sorelle Winery,Muscat,85.0,18.0,1,"Deep, dark, oaky and tannic, this wine opens with powerful aromas of charred barrels and wood smoke. Juicy flavors of blackberry and black cherry follow, with plenty of fine-textured tannins and a lingering finish. It's made from an unusual blend of Petite Verdot and Tannat grapes."
Sorelle Winery,Muscat Canelli,86.0,18.0,1,"Shy aromas of crisp yellow apple and brown sugar follow up on the palate, with compelling hints of orange blossom along the way. Quaffable and likable, it's made from 100% Chardonnay and finishes mellow and refined."
Sorelle Winery,Pinot Grigio,86.0,16.0,1,"From the marquee vineyard just down the road, known better for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this ZInfandel has 5% Petite Sirah blended in. Combined, they offer earthy and floral elements on the nose before a juicy palate of red fruit enters. A touch of olive plays off the bittersweet finish."
Sorelle Winery,Primitivo,83.67,22.0,3,Light aromas of plum and spice are followed by cherry flavors that show pleasing purity. This is a delightful example of the variety.
Sorelle Winery,Rosé,88.0,16.0,2,"With a handful of Sémillon in the blend, this is a fleshy, full-bodied style of white wine, offering darker tones of caramel and oak. Well made, it features a tangle of vanilla and butterscotch on the big finish."
Sorelle Winery,Sangiovese,88.0,23.0,2,"The blend of this wine has changed significantly in 2010, now an equal mix of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with 9% Syrah. As with other J. Bookwalter reds, it is loaded with appealing barrel toast, in both aroma and flavor. The Syrah shines through, adding spice and ripe berry flavors."
Soulmate,Nebbiolo,93.0,70.0,1,"Here's a pure, single vineyard, deeply-fruited Malbec, loaded with blackberry and cassis. It shows the varietal highlights of peppery herb, bark and earth, with well-managed tannins and good balance overall."
South Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,29.0,1,"There's a whiff of garrigue in this wine, scents and flavors of stem and herb and brambly berry. The acids are plentiful and bring notes of citrus threaded through the finish."
South Coast,Gewürztraminer,86.0,20.0,1,"Pure Petit Verdot has a loyal following, and fans of the unadulterated varietal version will find this a spot-on example. Scents of violets overlay dark red and black fruit aromas; flavors follow with earthy tannins well-modulated through a medium-long finish."
South Coast,Muscat Canelli,83.0,28.0,1,"A deep, dark color is followed by open and effusive aromas of wild berries and black cherries with a hint of bread dough-like freshness. Flavors are exuberantly fruity and dark, almost like dark-chocolate covered cherries. While full bodied, the wine is not too tannic or tart, since the oozing fruit flavors fill in any gaps."
South Coast,Pinot Grigio,88.0,19.0,1,"Smooth and juicy in red fruit with an edge of more savory cranberry, this wine from a great vineyard source rises to its occasion and to its site, offering high acidity, medium weight and a lingering, nearly spicy finish. It's enjoyable now but should show well through 2018."
South Coast,Red Blend,86.0,32.0,1,"A bit more lacy and less fleshy than the previous vintage, it augments its strawberry and raspberry fruit with barrel notes of baking spices and a hint of char. Give it plenty of breathing time and it pulls together nicely."
South Coast,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,16.0,1,"The damp yet smoky aromas of a campfire show on this wine from longtime Temecula farmers Gary Winder and Mike Rennie, along with blackberry jam and crushed oregano. The palate proves very grippy, with flavors of sweet tar, boysenberry and black pepper throughout."
South Coast,Sparkling Blend,89.0,19.0,1,"Some 85% of this was whole-cluster fermented, bringing plenty of grip and tannin along with plum and cherry fruit. There are typical Eola-Amity Hills suggestions of clean earth also, and the aging in one-third new French oak brings a little fullness to this substantial, still youthful wine."
South Coast,Syrah,88.0,26.0,2,"With deep color and generous, ripe fruit aromas, this gives a first impression of being a big wine—which it is. Flavors are deep and rich, like black currant jam and black cherry juice with hints of mint and nutmeg. The body is full, the tannins firm enough to back up that gorgeous flavor, and the texture stays velvety through the finish."
South Coast,Viognier,87.0,20.0,2,"Sturdy and tannic, this seems to be the heaviest and thickest of the 2012 wines from Elizabeth Chambers. Black cherry cola and dark chocolate combine, with an earthy undertone. It was aged for 21 months in neutral oak."
South Stage,Pinotage,88.0,30.0,1,"This wine is beautifully rendered, with pear and melon backed by hints of citrus. The length, persistance, balance and tension are superb, and the mouth-puckering finish will have you reaching for another glass."
South Stage,Red Blend,85.0,32.0,1,"This sophisticated, dry and affordable wine will shine at mealtime due to its balance between generous fruit flavors and an appetizing, moderately tannic texture. Aromas resemble raspberries and red cherries, while flavors are a bit riper than that. The acidity is lively and the finish lingers."
South Stage,White Blend,90.0,24.0,1,"Red apples, sourdough bread, cherry blossoms and strawberry zest show on the nose of this ever-so-slightly pink wine. The sipping experience is reminiscent of a fizzy, foamy mouthful of Pop Rocks flavored by sour cherries, altogether fun, tart and delicious."
Southard,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,25.0,2,"Crisp and fresh aromas of pineapple and melon lead on this pretty semi-sweet Riesling, and are followed by slightly sweet, floral flavors that are kept light with a citric, minerally backbone. Pair with chicken salad, Thai cuisine, even curry."
Southard,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,20.0,1,"A toasty nose of vanilla with a touch of grass leads this New York Chardonnay. Rich fruit flavors with a touch of sweet oak are appealing, if somewhat simple. Chilled with a plate of oysters on a warm night, this is a fun dinner choice."
Southard,Rhône-style White Blend,91.0,16.0,1,"Full of violet, flowery aromas that descend into oak, blackberry and cigar, this is a muscular Tempranillo with a feminine side, big yet smooth with subtle blueberry sweetness. Grown from the Rolleri Vineyard above Angels Camp and given 18 months of barrel age, this would make a spectacular pairing with wintertime roasts and stews."
Southard,Rosé,92.0,20.0,1,"A pungent, sappy Riesling, with a strong scent of rock and rind. This is powerful stuff—dry and a bit lean, but packed with texture and flavor. Subtle hints of citrus, pear and honey weave through. This needs more time to develop in the bottle."
Southard,Roussanne,87.0,20.0,1,"This starts out well, with soft, plummy fruit. It then turns a corner into an odd, lingering finish with residual flavors of sour fruit, plastic and gun metal."
Southard,Syrah,92.5,25.0,2,"Bittersweet and youthful, this wine is overburdened by tannin and a weightiness of oak. Blackberry and gunpowder showcase its 100% varietal devotion, before more oak presents itself on the finish."
Souverain,Chardonnay,87.0,35.0,1,"A 100-percent Cab Franc aged in all new French oak, this wine opens with aromas of vanilla and coconut, before imparting a taste of soft cassis and raspberry jam. Tightly structured, let it open for an hour or so before enjoying with roast chicken or quiche Lorraine."
Spangler,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,39.0,1,"Sourced from an eastern Oregon vineyard, XIX includes retired NFL great Keyshawn Johnson as one of the partners. Packaged in a massively heavy bottle, this pure Cabernet is well along the aging curve after spending 18 months in Hungarian oak and some years in bottle. It's tannic and toasty to the point of tasting charred, with pastry plum and raisin fruit flavors. It finishes quickly, with a streak of bell pepper."
Spann Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.33,25.67,3,"Light aromas of toast, apple, vanilla and custard are followed by lightly creamy fruit and barrel flavors that provide interest."
Spann Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.5,50.0,2,"Oregon Lagrein has to be about as rare as it gets. It's almost jet black, yet just 10% alcohol. It's a dark musky tannic wine, yet dilute and acidic, with little fruit flavor. Best paired with a burger or flank steak."
Spann Vineyards,Chardonnay-Viognier,87.0,21.0,2,"Pleasantly fruity and almost sweet, this medium-bodied wine offers a fruit bowl of flavor and freshness on the palate."
Spann Vineyards,Cinsault,88.0,25.0,1,"Inky red-purple in color and thick, this is a powerfully impressive Cabernet from the mighty Monte Rosso Vineyard. It's rich in spicy cinnamon, deep, dark plum and herbal tobacco. With the acidity in balance, it offers huge leather up front, dotted by undertones of cedar and pencil shavings. The finish is deftly accented by a seasoning of black pepper that lingers on the tongue."
Spann Vineyards,Red Blend,89.0,26.0,2,"This almost-pure Cabernet includes grapes sourced from Red Mountain and Horse Heaven Hills vineyards. The structure is gorgeous—massive yet precise—with a steely spine, great concentration and supple, mixed black fruits. A streak of lead pencil and a hint of toast contribute further complexity. Delicious already, this will reward cellaring through 2025."
Spann Vineyards,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,33.0,1,"This hides its 37 g/L residual sugar with bracing acidity and overall complexity. A dense run of ripe fruits—Meyer lemon, sweet pineapple, orange, tangerine and papaya—carries an interesting black tea note. The sweetness is detailed and complex, with honey and ginger candy flavors."
Spann Vineyards,Syrah,88.0,34.0,1,"Made from estate-grown fruit near the chilly Sonoma Coast town of Freestone, this is a fully layered wine, expertly balanced in acidity yet offering plenty of full-figured mouthfeel and viscous pleasure. It delivers an electric mix of Meyer lemon, minerals and brioche, and will please a diverse range of palates."
Spann Vineyards,White Blend,88.0,17.0,1,"Fans of Petit Verdot, which has almost attained cult status in Washington, will not want to miss this spectacular effort. Bright, chewy and muscular though it is, the tannins have been polished perfectly, and set off with 40% new oak, adding dark, smoky chocolate and espresso flavors. The acidity keeps up, underscoring tart berry fruit with some sweet green-tomato highlights."
Sparkman,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.67,43.89,9,"For this sweet and jammy wine, the fruit is sourced from what is reputed to be the second-oldest planting of Syrah in Washington State. Hints of lilac lead into concentrated flavors of blueberry and boysenberry, along with lush barrel accents of mocha and chocolate. Tannins are smooth and silky, and the wine has the grip and substance to cellar well through at least 2024."
Sparkman,Cabernet Franc,89.5,38.0,2,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, The Wanted is sourced from the Stillwater Creek and Stonetree vineyards. This textural, Cab-on-Cab creation is loaded with fig, plum, cherry and cassis fruit, highlights of cedar and tobacco, and supple, rich, ripe tannins. The wine is showing beautifully, but can only get even better with more age."
Sparkman,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,62.89,9,"A brooding Cabernet full of green and black olive, velvety cassis and cinnamon spice, this is ready to enjoy now. A juicy red, it has resolved tannins and a lingering taste of tobacco. Power and finesse are here, along with smoky minerality and savory fruit."
Sparkman,Chardonnay,90.14,35.29,7,"A Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this also holds small amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Sourced from the Conner Lee and Stonetree vineyards, it's supple, smooth and textural, with elegant, perfectly ripened fruit and a judicious application of two-thirds new French oak. It captures the elegance, restraint and overall structure of the challenging (and rewarding) 2011 vintage."
Sparkman,Grenache,90.0,32.0,1,"The famed winery comes a bit south to make this earthy, savory wine, with smoked sage, leather, forest floor, cherry and slate on the nose. The palate packs elegantly tart cranberry and pure flavors of sage-smoked wild cherry with the juicy elements of an herb-crusted pork tenderloin roast."
Sparkman,Malbec,88.5,38.0,2,"Made from a single clone, this wine delivers quiet explosions of clove, black currant and black pepper that flirt around a luxurious texture and unobtrusive oak, finding balance and integration amid plenty of complexity. Fully engaged and drinking nicely now, it'll stand up to further cellaring, through 2023."
Sparkman,Merlot,89.0,47.0,2,"The best Syrah yet from this biodynamic producer, this was fermented with native yeast and spent 10 months in 40% new French oak. It's a sleek, subtle and immensely complex wine that knits together beautifully. Juicy boysenberries, composted earth, iron filings and veins of coffee liqueur and licorice compound into a long finish."
Sparkman,Petit Verdot,89.0,48.0,1,"You've got to love the exotic aromas, great balance and firm texture of this complex Pinot. It's medium bodied, tangy and delicious due to good acidity and fresh, vibrant raspberry and red cherry flavors. It has appropriate fine tannins for a gripping mouthfeel, and a lingering finish."
Sparkman,Petite Sirah,92.0,42.0,1,"This bottling, limited to just 25 cases, comes out scented with oaky toast, cherry pipe tobacco and baking spices. Flavors of spiced cranberries, strawberry preserves and cherry compôte carry it along into a finish streaked with vanilla. It's big without any awkwardness, and should be consumed now through 2020."
Sparkman,Pinot Noir,87.0,36.0,2,"A knockout effort, this features perfectly ripened fruit flavors of berries, plums and cherries adorned with baking spices. There's a suggestion of candied citrus rind as well, but it's the superlush fruit that rocks on through a lengthy finish."
Sparkman,Red Blend,89.57,32.43,7,"Matching tart red fruit to the vineyard's characteristic gun-metal minerality, the wine cloaks itself in a light coat of ash and stone. Crisp acidity puts a tight focus on the stylish, resonant finish. Delicious now, it's built to age. Drink now–2030."
Sparkman,Rhône-style White Blend,87.5,24.0,4,"Set at the top of Cristom's excellent lineup, this lush, round and seductive wine is built upon ripe black-cherry fruit. It plays out broadly across the palate, open and smooth, with nuances of cola, sandalwood and spice. Crisp, natural acidity keeps it lifted and lively. Drink now through 2035."
Sparkman,Riesling,89.67,19.33,3,"A signature bottling from the relatively new appellation, this Sashi Moorman wine shows fresh-pressed boysenberry, black raspberry, dried violets and lavender on the zesty nose. There is an extreme amount of vibrancy to the palate, with black and white pepper spicing up the tart elderberry and juniper fruits, with licorice and menthol playing supporting roles."
Sparkman,Sauvignon Blanc,89.25,22.0,4,"From an appellation that thrived in this vintage comes a wine with aromas of cinnamon, nutmeg and licorice shavings atop fresh hibiscus and pomegranate flavors. There's bountiful energy on the palate, with flavors of dried-cherry and a densely packed array of chopped dill, roasted fennel and dried mint."
Sparkman,Syrah,91.5,51.33,12,"Some of the grapes for this unoaked white come from old vines, as well as some from the Musque clone, making for a tart, linear taste of lemon verbena and sizzling acidity that's somewhat overshadowed by the unctuous texture and full body."
Sparkman,Touriga Nacional,90.0,48.0,1,"There isn't much Zin in Washington, but this makes a good case for more. Thick and tannic, it's a meaty, dark wine that includes 25% Petite Sirah. Seventeen months in new American oak has left an indelible whisky-barrel scent. —P.G."
Sparrow Hawk,Chardonnay,89.0,25.0,1,"Pontin scores with a sweet, lemony, ripe mouthful of fresh and fruity Riesling. Shows the verve and juicy deliciousness of Yakima Valley fruit."
Spell,Pinot Noir,89.56,39.44,9,"Temperance Hill grapes are sourced for this Pinot Noir project. Barrel spices dominate, with tart berry fruit in the background. It's a solid effort, though it thins out and feels a bit stripped in the finish."
Spellbound,Petite Sirah,91.0,45.0,1,"The most recent planting at the estate vineyard gets its own designate. It's 100% Dijon 777 clone, and the flavors push stem and rock and forest floor front and center. For some tasters, that's enough; for others, a bit more actual fruit would be welcome. Right now it's a stiff, herbal wine that's already showing signs of drying out."
Spenker,Zinfandel,83.0,24.0,1,"This is a light easy-drinking style that fills the quaffable white wine bill quite nicely. It's lemony and tart, with a slice of orange peel for extra interest."
Spicy Vines,Barbera,90.0,38.0,1,"The winery notes that these vines were planted in 1983, and the wine offers generous dry extract along with dried apple fruit. It's lightly tawny in color, with sappy acids. Best to drink up in 2017."
Spicy Vines,Chardonnay,89.33,38.0,3,"The so-called Northern Whites are Gewürztraminer, Müller-Thurgau, Pinot Gris and Riesling. They make a comfortable blend, with floral aromas and plump peach and apple fruit. Though finished dry, it has appealing fruit sweetness."
Spicy Vines,Grenache,88.0,38.0,1,"This wine shows power and ripeness on the palate, with an oaky nuttiness on the nose. Lemony pear and stony minerality combine with a graham cracker creaminess, providing weight and length."
Spicy Vines,Pinot Noir,87.5,40.0,2,"This dessert-style wine is very fruity, quite sweet and boosted in alcohol. It has a spicy, earthy aroma, lots of plum and prune flavors, a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish."
Spicy Vines,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,38.0,1,"This is a blend of 96% Zinfandel with 3% Petite Sirah and 1% Carignane. Big, ripe and brawny, it features a generous helping of berry-cherry flavor that turns jammy and broad. Black pepper and cedar add context and contours to the rich experience."
Spicy Vines,Rosé,86.67,27.33,3,"This is a seldom-seen variety in the state. The aromas are brooding, with high-toned notes of dried herb, barrel spice and potpourri along with red fruit. The fruit flavors are tart and plump, soft and sumptuous, showing a pleasing sense of purity. One wants a bit more aromatically but there's still much to enjoy."
Spicy Vines,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,26.0,1,"The aromas bring notes of herb, dark fruit and spice, seemingly a bit muddled. The palate packs a big mouthful of fruit and savory flavors that show a sense of purity, while bringing a lightly tacky feel. A lack of aromatic clarity holds it back."
Spicy Vines,Syrah,90.67,33.67,3,"This full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend is hardly simple and fruity. It has earthy spicy leathery aromas along with raspberry flavors tinged by earth and tobacco, plus moderate tannins for a pleasantly grippy texture."
Spicy Vines,Zinfandel,85.5,33.5,2,"Clean and crisp aromas of Asian pear, lemongrass, honeysuckle, passion fruit and green plum show on the nose of this blend of 64% Sémillon and 36% Sauvignon Blanc. The palate would go down very easy on a hot day, with just a touch of acid-carrying flavors of gardenia, guava, mango and kaffir lime leaf."
Spindrift Cellars,Chardonnay,87.0,21.5,2,"This is a big tannic rustic wine, loaded with dark, bitter flavors. Cassis, espresso, smoke and charred earth all combine to carry through an astringent, tannic finish."
Spindrift Cellars,Pinot Noir,88.2,27.13,15,"A barely ripe blend of Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Riesling and Gewürztraminer, this has strong scents and flavors that combine in a rather strange way. Perfume, breath mint and tanned leather elements pile on, without really melding or enhancing one another. Whatever it is, it's not dull."
Spindrift Cellars,Rosé,88.0,16.0,1,"This Bordeaux blend is 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 5% each Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. Dry and astringent, it opens with a burst of pretty cherry fruit. As it breathes, some green-bean aromas and flavors develop. Best to drink this by the end of 2017."
Spindrift Cellars,Syrah,89.0,32.0,1,"This rich, thick, soft wine has Concord grape jelly and smoky oak aromas, with sweet blackberry flavors and a touch of tannin in the texture."
Spiriterra,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.5,65.0,2,"Light aromas of lemon peel, yellow pear and lemongrass make this an appealing option for pairing with Asian food of all kinds. The palate shows fresh lemon, lime peel and yellow grapefruit touches, along with a wet clay element."
Spiriterra,Muscadine,85.5,22.5,2,"This wine is simple in its silky smooth expression of blackberry, chocolate and sweet tobacco flavors, imparting full-bodied concentration and modest oak."
Spiriterra,Rosé,83.0,25.0,1,"This nicely captures the complexity and earthiness of Washington Syrah, without becoming too heavy. Raspberry fruit is backed by earthy flavors and peppery herb, nicely integrated with nothing obtrusive. This is not the sweet and jammy style of Syrah you find in California, but it has a lot to offer if you give it a good look."
Spoto,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,77.5,2,"This Bordeaux blend (with some Syrah in the mix also) opens with dark, toasty, smoky scents underscoring sleek berry fruit. It's done in a somewhat lean style, but nicely balanced. Details of olive, tobacco, cedar and coffee run through the finish. The best Narcissa released so far."
Spoto,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,129.0,2,"Excellent winemaking by Mike Januik, as with all these Novelty Hill wines, keeps the fruit, acid and tannins all in perfect proportion. The flavors mix blackberry and black cherry; and this young wine is still firm and wound tight."
Spottswoode,Cabernet Sauvignon,95.25,126.25,4,"Novelty Hill's vineyard-designated Syrah is bigger, darker and more aromatically complex than the companion Columbia Valley bottling. Cassis and blackberry fruit flavors are layered with chocolate and spice; immaculately clean, this does not display the earthy/meaty aspect of Syrah, but does have a pleasing minerality at the core."
Spring Mountain Vineyard,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,137.5,2,"The structure of this Syrah, from a vineyard in the Royal Slope, is impressive. It's a balanced blend of flavors, with juicy raspberry and blackberry fruit, black olive, pepper and spice."
Spring Mountain Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,75.0,1,"Aromatically earthy like just-rained-on mushrooms, this red offers a taste of baked fig and mocha amidst generous tannins and a long, textured finish marked by dark plum."
Spring Mountain Vineyard,Chardonnay,90.0,50.0,1,"Made in an unctuous style, it's fragrantly rich in cinnamon and clove, and medium-weight, with soft, moderate tannins. With smaller percentages of Petite Sirah, Zinfandel and Merlot it finishes with a pronounced taste of vanilla oak."
Spring Mountain Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,90.5,40.0,2,There's an electric current of spice on the first sip. Beyond it are waves of faint strawberry and thin layers of ripe red cherry and a touch of herb. The finish lingers.
Spring Valley Vineyard,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.77,50.0,13,"A linear expression of lemon zest and quince, this is a creamy-textured blend of 50% Marsanne, 29% Roussanne and 21% Viognier with a quick, crisp finish."
Spring Valley Vineyard,Cabernet Franc,90.5,50.0,6,"Kenneth Volk is the Central Coast master of nontraditional California varieties. His take on Albariño delivers peach, citrus and mineral aromas, reflective of the historic Riverbench Vineyard. The taste comes on a tad juicy, then wipes away quickly, with apple tartness on the finish."
Spring Valley Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,50.0,3,"Tight in elegant raspberry and cassis fruit, this small-production Cabernet is on the cool-climate side of the equation, reflective of the vintage. Tastes of black and bell peppers are interspersed with cedar, and the finish is purely oak."
Spring Valley Vineyard,Malbec,91.0,50.0,1,"Earthy with an expansive mouthfeel, this brambly, savory Syrah reveals hints of herb and deep, dark black fruit. It comes from a great vineyard site and is structured to age; give it air before enjoying with a proper cassoulet."
Spring Valley Vineyard,Merlot,88.5,50.0,2,"Yorba and 3rd Generation are the brands made by viticulturist Ann Kraemer of Shake Ridge Ranch. This wine is meant to serve as a second label, a blend of 84% Zinfandel, 10% Petite Sirah and 6% Tempranillo made by one of Ann's nephews. It's an impressive first attempt, robust and gamy in soft leather and ripe chewy plum."
Spring Valley Vineyard,Petit Verdot,91.0,50.0,1,"This Syrah/Mourvèdre blend is a forward, bright and seamless expression of peppery berry fruit. Tart, smooth and accessible, it's backed with refreshing minerality and a dollop of cocoa."
Spring Valley Vineyard,Red Blend,89.0,50.0,2,"Tranche is exploring lesser-known (for Walla Walla) grapes such as this Tempranillo, producing wines with structure and depth. Blueberry fruit and a big wash of roasted coffee ground flavors are here, with dry, firm tannins. The length is impressive."
Spring Valley Vineyard,Syrah,91.2,50.0,5,"As can happen with young wines like just-released rosé, a slight bit of effervescence is visible. The interesting smell of fermentation gives rise to strawberry and pink bubblegum scents. The gum persists on the palate, but in a pleasant, not overwhelming or sweet way, as does red licorice and watermelon."
Springhill Cellars,Pinot Noir,85.0,32.5,2,"From the only Riesling vines planted in the Walla Walla AVA, this Figgins wine club-only selection makes you wish for more. It has lovely layering of citrus pith and rind flavors, a mouth-cleansing minerality, and exceptional depth of flavor. Finished completely dry, it registers just 12% alcohol."
Springhouse Cellar,Cabernet Sauvignon,83.0,24.0,1,"With an inviting strawberry sundae nose, this bright pink rosé of Syrah from the longtime organically minded team at Buttonwood is all about summertime hedonism. There's creaminess on the palate, with some apple tartness in the middle and, again, long strawberry elements on the finish. Pair with beef sliders on soft, sweet rolls that are adorned with gourmet condiments and cheeses."
Springhouse Cellar,Sauvignon Blanc,85.0,18.0,1,"Bright acidity accompanies tight, wild berry fruits. As with many Malbecs, the fruit is balanced against clean earth and stem, with a touch of tomato leaf in the aromas."
Square Peg,Pinot Noir,92.0,53.0,1,"A bit less inky than some of its Syrah counterparts from more northern regions, the violet, potting soil, pepper and vanilla aromas make for a solid sipping experience. It's very soft and pleasurable to the palate, with black pepper up front and on the finish."
St. Amant,Tempranillo,87.0,18.0,1,"An aromatic wine with abundant notes of ripe white peach, apricot, mineral and flowers. It drinks off dry (10.7 g/L residual sugar) with a pleasing sense of tension between the acid and stone fruit flavors leading to a long, persistent finish."
St. Amant,Zinfandel,91.0,27.67,3,"This is a Bordeaux-style blend from three Red Mountain vineyards: 50% Merlot, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Cabernet Franc. Stiff tannins underscore tight black cherry and cassis fruit, with a generous helping of new oak barrel flavors. The wine is young and substantial, with excellent aging potential through 2024."
St. Francis,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.33,39.0,3,"This rather exotic Riesling was fermented and aged in barrels, 43% new, and the rest once-used. The barrel treatment takes it away from any ordinary Riesling characteristics, yielding a wine that has much in common with Viognier—floral and buttery, with substantial alcohol."
St. Francis,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,54.0,3,"This is the first Dineen designate from :Nota Bene, and it's worth chasing down. Focused dark purple and black fruits line up—cherry, plum and cassis—with a rich layer of espresso and a lick of graphite following. The 22 months in barrel brings an interesting hint of caramel to a nicely balanced finish."
St. Francis,Malbec,90.0,38.0,1,"A ripe and tasty style of Zinfandel from a grand old name in the Sierra Foothills. The maple and brown sugar tones from new oak integrate well with ripe but not overripe fruit flavors. Touches of clove and black pepper come out as you sip, adding welcome nuances."
St. Francis,Meritage,88.0,66.5,2,"This Bordeaux-style blend is 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, and 34% Cabernet Franc. Some 20% saw new French oak, and the wine has lovely concentration and flavor integration. Blueberry, blackberry and cassis are wrapped in cacao and coffee—thoroughly luscious and nicely concentrated."
St. Francis,Merlot,88.62,48.75,8,"The grape's brooding character is intensified in this old-vine bottling, with deep, brandy-like aromas of kirsch, cocoa syrup and spearmint. Tannins frame the heavy-duty palate profile, with extracted cherry, cola and vanilla flavorings decorating a firm, balancing structure."
St. Francis,Red Blend,88.0,50.0,1,"Evoking the richness and slightly tart deliciousness of a strawberry-rhubarb compote, this is a bright, vibrant and chewy Pinot, its dry tannins peaking on the finish. From a great vineyard site long sourced by the producer, it's on the lighter side in terms of body and weight, and may need further time to come into its own, through 2017."
St. Francis,White Blend,87.0,13.0,1,"Lemon-lime soda scents are rounded out by pineapple and a metallic element on the nose of this wine by Christian Roguenant. It's tight and minerally on the palate, with steel and gunmetal, yet shows green herbs like dill too. It will work well with white fish."
St. Francis,Zinfandel,88.29,37.86,7,"Smooth, ripe and almost sweet, this is medium to full bodied, packed full of fruit flavors and other complexity that makes it interesting. It balances toward softness as the berry and cherry character seems to swell on the palate and linger on the finish."
St. Innocent,Chardonnay,91.67,26.0,3,"Hailing from Destiny Ridge, Double Canyon and McKinley Spring vineyards, this wine is lighter in color and shows subtle suggestions of vanilla, chocolate, woodspice and red cherry. It's reserved in style with coffee flavors and soft, plump tannins."
St. Innocent,Pinot Blanc,90.0,22.0,3,"This kitchen-sink blend of Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Cabernet Franc proves more herbaceous than ripe on the nose, with dried and chopped oregano and thyme, wet slate and cigar box notes. It's all earth and stone on the palate, with just a touch of stark plum fruit emerging."
St. Innocent,Pinot Gris,90.0,22.0,1,"This blend of six Bordeaux varieties is a little funky out of the gate with notes of woodspice, mushroom, cayenne, dry chocolate and cherry. The palate has mouthwatering cherry flavors that bring along some warmth on the finish."
St. Innocent,Pinot Noir,90.75,39.88,16,"This blend of 62% Syrah and 38% Petite Sirah conveys mocha, smoke and woodspice. It's full bodied in feel with coffee flavors backed by astringent tannins that provide a bit of distraction."
St. Innocent,Rosé,88.0,20.0,1,"Broad berry/cherry fruit flavors open up quickly, with lighter accents of compost and leather. This is a smooth, somewhat loose-knit wine, with pretty baking spices decorating the finish."
St. Rose,Pinot Noir,93.5,41.25,4,"The current edition of this nonvintage rosé is a blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Bone-dry, tart and tangy, it's a versatile, food-friendly wine, with flavors of tart citrus flesh and rind. A dash of white pepper marks the long, full-bodied finish."
St. Supéry,Cabernet Franc,89.0,65.0,2,"Two Dijon clones went into this tasty Chardonnay, which is rounded out and easily accessible upon opening. Smooth tree-fruit flavors are set in a lightly buttery frame, with nutmeg spice. As it rolls along the impression of fresh-baked brioche is undeniable. Delicious and ready to enjoy immediately, this should hold up in the cellar through 2021 or so."
St. Supéry,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.33,90.83,6,"Planted in 1983, this is the original Willamette Valley Vineyards estate vineyard. These old vines give an extra dollop of herb and stem, well integrated into concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit. This has the tannic muscle and acid underpinning to age well. Drink now–2025."
St. Supéry,Malbec,86.5,50.0,2,"This block selection is supple, almost silky, and coats the palate with lip-licking cherry-fruit goodness. Streaks of hazelnut and nougat extend the finish. This delicious wine spent 15 months in 50% new French oak."
St. Supéry,Merlot,88.0,50.0,2,"From the famed vineyard named for the colorful author, this wine remains a standout for the producer, and a tremendous deal for the quality. It exudes notes of eucalyptus on the nose, before unveiling big-boned but balanced tannins, with leather and cranberry notes meeting a tensile line of minerality. It finishes with a taste of mocha."
St. Supéry,Moscato,87.33,25.0,3,"This is a rather tense, tightly wound wine, offering tart cranberry and raspberry fruit. Tangy, juicy acidity keeps flavors fresh and forward, with a mineral underpinning."
St. Supéry,Petit Verdot,91.0,50.0,2,"From a warm site, this shows warm, ripe round flavors of lush strawberry and cherry. It plays out broadly across the palate, retaining its focus in a medium-long follow-through. It's perfect for near-term drinking."
St. Supéry,Red Blend,90.5,75.0,2,"Situated in the McMinnville AVA, this vineyard delivers a sleek, well-proportioned wine. Though tight and unyielding at first, it is aromatically promising, with a mix of rose petals, berries and chocolate. Those flavors expand as it breathes open, finishing with the AVA's characteristic gun-metal minerality. Drink 2018–2028."
St. Supéry,Sauvignon Blanc,87.33,30.0,3,"Bold and nicely astringent, this wine is full bodied, rich in flavor and even richer in texture due to a thick layer of fine tannins. Built almost like a Cabernet but with brighter fruit flavors, the wine is attractively dry and meant to be enjoyed with something rich like a roast or steak."
St. Supéry,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,87.5,30.0,2,"The spare red fruit seems set in stone. The AVA's characteristic sub-flavors of concrete and dry stone are on full display. The wine remains tightly wound, with crisp definition. This should benefit from another couple of years in bottle. It finishes with plenty of acid and chalk."
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.3,99.0,10,"Sourced from a single block, this is a tart wine with delicate fruit flavors of rhubarb and cranberry. It does not have the depth nor stuffing of the previous vintage. Some pleasant aromatics of orange peel and citrus add interest."
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,Chardonnay,89.0,34.0,4,"There's nothing shy about this red, which is robust, earthy and forcefully tannic. It's a rough-and-tumble red with hearty black cherry, charred wood and truffled chocolate. Big flavors, and big tannins are ready for a big cut of beef."
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,26.0,4,"This spent 18 months in French oak and three years in bottle, ahead of an April 2016 release. Light and elegant, it carries a whiff and taste of leather, with earthy, slightly grainy tannins. With air, the strawberry fruit gains some flesh. Decant it and drink now through 2018."
Stags' Leap Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.6,133.0,5,"Baked lemon, jasmine and honeyed Pink Lady apples open the nose of this bottling, a special anniversary project for the usually Rhône-only winery. Lighter flavors of lemon zest and crisp apple flesh sit atop a chalky grip, making for a wine that would work well with a variety of lighter foods."
Stags' Leap Winery,Petite Sirah,92.5,102.5,2,"This atypical blend of 56% Syrah and 44% Merlot shows red roses and red currants on the rather light nose. The palate is also delicately layered with light red plums, tangy strawberries and a tight bay leaf herbal component."
Stags' Leap Winery,Red Blend,90.0,69.0,4,"The fourth-generation family behind San Antonio Winery make this top-end bottling from the vineyard they planted. Aromas of dark red fruit, heavy black spice, tar and smoke hit the nose with promising force, but the palate proves quite tannic with sour and bitter cranberry skins. This has all the elements needed for a classic wine, but give till 2016."
Stama,Zinfandel,84.0,24.0,1,"Aromas of coffee, cinnamon toast, cranberry and clove emerge off of this blend of 56% Syrah, 24% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre by UC Davis grad-friends Richard Bruno and Chris Condos. It's not too complicated on the palate but very food-friendly, with dark red fruit, licorice and tree bark, blending ripe and tart elements for a straight-ahead sipper."
Standing Stone,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,23.0,1,"This big-bodied Zinfandel intrigues with a commingling of rustic charm and brawny California ripeness. The power and concentration of lush blackberry and plum are accessorized by dusty leather and dried herb, with a finishing touch of black pepper."
Standing Stone,Chardonnay,84.5,20.0,2,"Annette Hoff Danzer is only the second female winemaker in Monterey County, and her wine from Chualar Canyon on the east side of the Salinas Valley offers aromas of fragrant white flowers, lemon-lime soda and lychee. The racy acidity is a bit strong on the palate, but will unwind nicely in months to come, with flavors of ripe lemon and crushed rocks."
Standing Stone,Riesling,89.5,22.0,2,"Earthy and dry, this single-block designated white is fresh in cut grass and hay, with a tropical edge. Composed and steely, especially on the finish, it provides plenty of richness balanced by classic acidity."
Standing Stone,Vidal Blanc,87.0,25.0,1,"This chewy, still-tight Cabernet is full-bodied on the palate, revealing savory, herbaceous characteristics. Made in a robust style, it's approachable and enjoyable now."
Standing Sun,Merlot,88.0,18.0,1,"This traditional blend of 36% Merlot, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 7% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec offers the expected aromas of cedar, plums, tobacco, cracked pepper and slight mint. It's very easy on the palate, with boysenberries and a woody complexity, proving light and tasty."
Standing Sun,Rhône-style White Blend,89.0,20.0,1,"Scents and flavors of sandalwood and root beer come up first, with strawberry and cherry fruit following. Sourced principally from Winter's Hill vineyard, it's a gentle wine that gains momentum through the finish. Slightly reductive burnt rubber notes come in late, but with vigorous aeration the flavors smooth out."
Standing Sun,Riesling,91.0,24.0,1,"The dry style of this firm and earthy-tasting wine should be great paired with rich proteins. It shows black currant and dark chocolate flavors dusted with cedar. Medium bodied and moderately tannic, it has good balance and a lingering finish. Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah are the two main elements of the blend."
Standing Sun,Syrah,85.0,20.0,1,"A very elegant and refined Evenstad Reserve, with grace notes of sandalwood and a lovely cherry core. The fruit is immaculate, the concentration focused and lengthy, and the flavors are so artfully blended that the wine is seamless and perfectly balanced. Although it is drinking like a mature wine, there is every reason to cellar wines such as this—it can develop like a fine Burgundy, over decades."
Stanger,Red Blend,91.0,44.0,1,"Woody tannins bring astringency to this wine, which presents a smoky undercurrent of char and oak. Tart red fruit provides a nuanced fruit component."
Star Lane Vineyard,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,80.0,2,"This expands the winery's portfolio with a nod to the $20 pricepoint that's become a defining limit to affordable Oregon Pinot. This wine is hard, slightly burnt and bitter in the finish, with simple candy cherry-fruit flavors."
Star Lane Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.67,86.67,3,"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, this is a big, juicy wine with high acidity and a taste of crisp, red fruit. Substantial tannins suggest cellaring through 2018–2020 to elongate the young, puckering finish."
Starfield,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,55.0,1,"This wine makes a big impression with wild, earthy aromas and dense, fruit-laden flavors. It blends ripe plum, smoke, tart blackberry and rich black cherry notes on a base of firm tannins and fresh acidity. These are rich, complex and carry through to the lingering finish. It's made from 85% Mourvèdre, plus Syrah, Grenache and Counoise."
Starfield,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,65.0,2,"Just-cracked, yeasty sourdough bread and dried lemon-skin aromas float off of this bottle-aged sparkler from an esteemed, longtime producer. Her winemaker son named this wine in honor of her birth year. An oxidative warmth gives bready depth to the palate, which shows lots of toast and lemon marmalade flavors."
Stark,Barbera,91.0,34.0,1,"Cocoa, vanilla and baking spice aromas lead off this wine, along with plum. On the palate rich, textured dark fruit flavors intermingle with barrel spices. The fruit and oak have equal footing."
Stark,Viognier,88.0,28.0,2,"This 100% varietal wine was aged for two years in American oak, half of it new. With a mouthful of clove, cinnamon and black currant, as well as leather, it remains juicy on the palate, though should take on additional complexity after cellaring. Drink now through 2020."
Starmont,Chardonnay,92.0,45.0,1,"This wine is immediately appealing with vibrant aromas of jasmine, honeysuckle, white peach and wet stone. It drinks off dry, with a fleshy feel and drawn-out fruit flavors that linger."
Starmont,Pinot Noir,91.5,19.0,2,"The first release of this wine to carry a Yakima Valley designation, this blend of Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre and Cinsault leaps up with aromas of fresh raspberries, plum, garrigue and pepper along with light barrel accents. The elegant flavors show a striking sense of freshness and purity that keep you coming back for more."
Stasis,Chardonnay,89.0,42.0,1,"This botrytized wine came from 2011 vintage grapes that were not harvested until February 2012. A light-golden color, it's bright with aromas of dried apples, pears and flowers. It's sweet (170g/L residual sugar) but not weighty, retaining a sense of lightness and elegance."
Stasis,Pinot Noir,89.0,42.0,1,"This wine is 38% Cabernet Franc, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 14% Petit Verdot. Aromas are locked-up at present, with notes of flowers, high-toned herbs, earth, licorice and dark fruit. The palate is reserved in style, with a smooth feel and a firm squeeze of lightly dry tannins on the finish."
Steele,Chardonnay,91.0,30.0,1,"Prominent aromas of freshly hewn wood, butterscotch and vanilla are out in front of cherry. It's full flavored, seeming a bit boozy with grainy tannins backing it all up."
Steele,Pinot Noir,87.0,30.0,2,"A blend of equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, with smaller dollops of Petite Sirah, Merlot and Malbec, this is a dark, inky wine, brawny in leather, clove and meat. Big-bodied and oaky, it finishes in a sea of brambly blackberry and wild game."
Stein Family,Moscato,85.0,20.0,2,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this wine brings reserved notes of cherry and blackberry cordial, medicine cabinet, black licorice, dried herbs and smoke. The fruit flavors are lighter in style, backed by firm tannins. It finishes tart."
Steiner Family Vineyards,Tempranillo,88.0,26.0,3,"Starting quite reductive, this wine opens to reveal aromas of straw, toast, cream and spice. The flavors are lighter in style yet creamy in feel with lees notes running throughout."
Steiner Family Vineyards,Zinfandel,86.0,19.5,2,"This blend of 50% Nebbiolo, 25% Barbera and 25% Syrah offers aromas of fudge, blackberry and plum that are somehow both lean and rich. It's thick and full on the palate, with pepper spice, leather, tobacco and violets, yet the acidity is quite powerful. Serve with hearty pasta."
Stellareese,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,42.0,2,"Buttery cream is on the nose of this vineyard-designate, a relatively affordable offering from an esteemed producer in the heart of the Napa Valley. Oaky on the palate, the medium-weighted wine is nicely offset by a searingly crisp bite of lemon that peaks on the finish."
Stellina,Zinfandel,90.0,32.0,1,"This wine from the pioneering producer deep in the Santa Maria Valley shows sweet cedar, chopped herbs, mocha, licorice, cherry and red berry juice on the nose. The flavors cling to dried cherries and espresso, proving quite pleasant thought not extremely dynamic."
Stemilt Creek,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,33.33,3,"The vineyard name is a combination of the two prevalent soil types, Nekia and WillaKenzie. Along with sweet cherry fruit comes a defining minerality—a streak of iron running through the heart of the wine. Balanced nicely, with gentle acidity and sculpted tannins. In the finish you pick up an elegant streak of green tea."
Stemilt Creek,Merlot,85.33,24.67,3,"This opens with a very pretty nose—scents of clay, mineral, blueberry, cassis and a whiff of rather high-toned volatility. In the mouth the barrel flavors bring dusty cocoa and chocolate. A full-bodied wine, still young, sharp and edgy. Best to give it a few more years in the cellar, to smooth out some of the rawness."
Stemilt Creek,Red Blend,86.33,22.67,3,"Though it seems quite light on first impression, that is a bit deceptive. The biodynamic grapes show a muted earthiness, while over time the cranberry and raspberry flavors gain focus and concentration in the mouth. A graceful, nicely proportioned wine, with some stem and grip to the tannins."
Stemilt Creek,Rosé,82.0,19.0,1,"Powerful vanilla scents rise from the glass, but the fruit, even in this difficult vintage, comes out immediately. It's tart and sharp, with a strong herbal component, and the wine snaps into focus quickly with fruit, acid, tannin, herb and vanilla in equal proportion. Firm and tight, still quite young, this wine needs decanting and/or further bottle age to show its best."
Stemilt Creek,Syrah,86.0,45.0,1,"Tart, tangy, and herbal, this juicy wine mixes cranberry and strawberry fruit with tomato leaf, herb and peppery spice. If new oak barrels were used, they are not showing themselves at the moment. But the balance, length and detail are delightful."
Stemilt Creek,White Blend,85.0,13.0,1,"Take a walk on the wild side with this Rhône-style red. The meaty, spicy, earthy aromas lead to enjoyable fruit, spice and mocha flavors that rest on a firm bed of fine tannins and good acidity."
Stemmler,Pinot Noir,90.5,44.0,4,"This blend of 51% Syrah, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Grenache shows root beer, smoked black cherries, dark chocolate and sweet tar on the nose. The palate is powered by dried red fruits, more smoke and a dusty character."
Steorra,Sparkling Blend,90.0,23.0,1,"Old-vine Oregon Zinfandel is not common; in fact, this is all of them. From the Pines Vineyard, planted around a century ago, revived in the 1980s, these wines have a power and unique presence that sets them apart from Zin from anywhere else. Ultraripe fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, alcohol above 15%, amazing density and beautifully managed tannins, with some sweet grain flavors that say “old vines.”"
Stephen Ross,Albariño,90.5,23.0,2,"Light and murky, with a flavor mix of tomato, vegetable juice, celery, barely ripe berries and thin acids. That sounds worse than it is; taste this alongside a Bourgogne from a big shipper in a cool vintage and you wouldn't see much difference. The alcohol here is listed at just 12.5%. It's a serviceable everyday wine, but not priced accordingly."
Stephen Ross,Chardonnay,91.33,34.0,3,"This delicately spritzy Riesling carries a whiff of orange rind, along with fresh flavors of lightly sweet tree fruits. Tasty on its own, or use it as a mixer for cocktails or punches."
Stephen Ross,Grenache,92.0,34.0,2,"A tarry, soft, straight-shooting red wine with a subtle herbal component, touch of anise and long finish. There is excitement building in the Sierra Foothills about the potential for Cab Franc and this is a fine place to start exploring. Pair with a meat—chicken, lamb or pork—richly adorned in herbs to bring out the wine's herbal notes more fully."
Stephen Ross,Pinot Gris,87.33,21.33,3,"Pale salmon in color, this delivers strawberry and watermelon aromas. It's dry on the palate, but the flavors fall a bit flat."
Stephen Ross,Pinot Noir,92.08,39.08,12,An aroma like toasted marshmallows and a sweet candied-fruit flavor make this wine taste soft and almost cloying. It has a broad pillowy texture and buttery finish.
Stephen Ross,Zinfandel,89.0,34.0,2,"Skunky, this wine is thick and shiny, with a metallic edge. The fruit leans into notions of wild strawberry."
Stephen Vincent,Red Blend,90.0,17.0,1,"Full-bodied and aromatic, this richly scented wine beguiles with a mix of brambly fruit and cola highlights. Firm, ripe tannins suggest a sturdy wine ready for the cellar, which nonetheless lets the fruit shine through the peppery finish."
Steppe Cellars,Malbec,88.0,28.0,1,"The label includes the words “Original Vines” written along the side, a nod to the history of this limited reserve, gleaned from vines planted by founder David Lett in 1965. It's steely and sharp edged, with sculpted fruit and limited use of new oak. Cellarworthy and distinctive, this wine rewards your attention and patience with unexpected layers of detail."
Steppe Cellars,Red Blend,88.0,28.0,1,"This is the winery's reserve bottling, representing the best five barrels of the vintage. Supple and refined, it frames its young berry fruit flavors in elegant tannins. Nicely focused and still a bit raw, this wine will reward some further years of aging."
Sterling,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,70.0,1,"Spicy and showing some sweetness around the edges, presumably from a bit of residual sugar. Lovely fruit is the highlight here, textural and luscious with flavors of pears and apricots. Vivid acidity cuts through the fleshy core."
Sterling,Rosé,88.0,14.0,1,"The fruit is sourced from Mark Ryan-designated rows in the Lachini Vineyard. Fermented with native yeast in stainless steel, and aged in 50% new French oak, this opens with plenty of green tea-flavored tannins, and an undercurrent of earth and wood, but the Pinot fruit shines through and expands, with notes of cola, cherry fruit and a streak of iron."
Sterling,White Blend,82.0,45.0,1,"Light aromas of candle wax, kiwi and citrus lead to diluted fruit flavors. It lacks a sense of cohesion or variety."
Sterling,Zinfandel,82.0,35.0,1,"Tropical and stone-fruit aromas mix with notes of vanilla, cinnamon and other barrel spices. The palate is full bodied, with a rounded feel and a finish that carries. It shows some pleasing nuances."
Steven Kent,Cabernet Franc,88.5,50.0,2,"A tiny-production wine at the producer's higher end of pricing and intent, this offers juicy red fruit around dense, sizable tannins that are on the way to being integrated and resolved. There's a softness on the palate and it finishes with a note of cinnamon."
Steven Kent,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.4,81.5,10,"Violets, lilacs, black pepper, blackberry paste and hot asphalt show on the nose of this 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah blend from the appellation in the heart of Monterey County. The palate is ripe and juicy with boysenberry and blackberry fruits, wrapped up in a tannic asphalt structure."
Steven Kent,Chardonnay,91.5,34.0,2,"High-toned aromas of herbs, dark coffee, blue fruit and orange peel are followed by saturated black-fruit flavors."
Steven Kent,Malbec,90.5,50.0,2,"Aromas of white flowers, tangerine, honey and ginger are vibrant on this cryo-frozen wine. The flavors are sweet, tapering toward the finish."
Steven Kent,Petit Verdot,89.33,50.0,3,"Sangiovese from this appellation is quite a rarity. This one offers aromas of vanilla, coconut and dark cherries that are followed by full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. The variety gets lost in the oak but it still brings appeal."
Steven Kent,Red Blend,93.0,155.0,1,"Let this wine open in the bottle or glass to reveal a mix of spicy cinnamon, dark chocolate and berry crumble that's entirely inviting. Soft in texture, the body is full and generous in weight and length, representative of its mountain roots."
Steven Kent,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,24.0,1,"Grenache (38%) takes the lead followed by Mourvèdre (34%) and Syrah, with the fruit coming from Seven Hills and Les Collines vineyards. Blueberry pie, herb and spice aromas are followed by extracted blue and black-fruit flavors that bring some warmth along with them."
Steven Kent,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,89.0,24.0,1,"Thick tannins obscure some of the richer flavors trying to burst through in this wine, a mix of blackberry, black olive and cedar. Full bodied and generous in every way, it finishes with a slow drag of smoke."
Steven Kent,White Blend,91.0,24.0,1,"This wine comes from the producer's 100% organic farm, 55 acres of its 356 planted to vines. It shows balance and grace, the grapes having enjoyed extended maceration on their skins, then let to age in mostly stainless steel, and a tiny amount of neutral oak. Light, crisp and simple, it offers a length of melon and stone fruit."
Stevens,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.71,33.57,7,"Aromas of peach and lime are followed by a sleek, crisp, off-dry palate with a long, lemony finish. A light spritz perks it up nicely."
Stevens,Cabernet Franc,89.5,31.33,6,"The variety announces itself, with pleasing aromas of plum, boysenberry, black pepper and dried herbs. The flavors are elegant and show a dazzling sense of purity."
Stevens,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.14,43.71,7,"Baked blueberry pie, vanilla and anise notes are quite inviting, albeit more cooked than fresh on the nose. That baked-fruit character paints the palate too, with black plum, black cherry and vanilla-laced fudge, showing prettier lavender touches on the edge."
Stevens,Chardonnay,89.0,25.0,1,"Juicy wild berries and black raspberries are leveled by touches of asphalt and vanilla on the nose of this small-batch garagiste bottling. Graphite and tar add minerality to the palate, though the sip is dominated by hot-out-of-the-oven elderberry pie. Lavender adds florality."
Stevens,Malbec,90.8,31.6,5,"Pleasing aromas of fresh pear, tropical fruit, melted butter and vanilla are followed by rounded pear and vanilla flavors that show a light touch."
Stevens,Merlot,90.0,32.0,4,"This wine is composed of five varieties, with none making up more than 21% of the blend. Fresh aromas of berry, cranberry, red currant and herbs are followed by fruit-forward cherry and berry flavors that bring appeal."
Stevens,Red Blend,87.75,22.25,4,"This wine is dry and rather full bodied, starting with fruity aromas like banana and coconut then seguing to more nutty, oaky, complex flavors and a rich texture. It's a serious dinner wine with heft and substance."
Stevens,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,19.0,4,"Aromas of coffee, barrel spice and dark-blue fruit lead to rich, full-bodied blackberry and spice flavors. It's not for the faint of heart but delivers a lot of enjoyment."
Stevens,Syrah,90.83,31.33,6,"Yellow pear, fresh-squeezed lime, light mint and wet-cement aromas show on the brisk nose of this bottling by veteran Adam Tolmach. A grippy texture and lively acidity frame the palate, where green apple and lime flavors show. It's clean, pure and easy."
Stevens,Viognier,89.5,19.5,4,"This Tempranillo-based pinkie is quite inviting and tightly textured, with aromas of orange shave ice, strawberry cream, watermelon and cement. It is extremely zesty and lively once sipped, offering easy-to-drink raspberry and melon notes. It's great for all sorts of food, from spicy to rich."
Stewart,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,175.0,1,"The aromas of whole lime, flowers, jasmine and watermelon Jolly Rancher pop. It drinks off dry, with floral flavors that carry through the finish."
Still Waters,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.33,39.33,3,"Smoky aromas and a bold apricot flavor give this dry and seemingly light-bodied wine a distinct personality. Fermented in small concrete egg-shaped vats, it's far from simple and fruity, and instead offers great acidity and a tangy, tempting, appetizing personality."
Still Waters,Cabernet Franc,91.0,28.0,2,"Aromas of baking spice, clove and dried red fruit lead to full yet elegant flavors that coat the palate. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but should do well at the dinner table."
Still Waters,Primitivo,92.0,38.0,1,"Aromas of vanilla, coconut and wood spice lead to wood-filled flavors. The barrel notes are in complete control."
Still Waters,Red Blend,86.0,40.0,1,"A pale peach color, this wine offers aromas of strawberry, watermelon and cherry. The flavors are on the lighter side of medium bodied, with tart notes on the finish."
Still Waters,Syrah,89.0,32.0,1,"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling boasts cedar-driven aromas augmented with rust, strawberry, leather and lava rock scents. The palate leads with cigar-like tobacco notes, building toward heavy red fruit and framed by sticky tannins."
Still Waters,Viognier,89.0,24.0,1,"This blend of 69% Syrah and 31% Grenache is smoky and oaky, with a strong charred meat flavor that obscures its lightly ripe strawberry fruit. The finish is simple and light."
Stoller,Chardonnay,90.86,34.14,7,"The aromas are up front, with barrel notes of char, vanilla, coconut and baking spice followed by cigar box. The wood really shows through on the palate as well, with the tannins bringing a strong sense of astringency."
Stoller,Pinot Noir,88.95,44.55,22,"A Bordeaux-style blend, it's half Merlot, the rest split between the Cabs. Suggestions of sweaty, funky aromas lead into a core of sweet candied fruit. It's a bit disjointed, fine for glugging, not for keeping."
Stoller,Riesling,87.0,25.0,2,"This sturdy, homespun red blend of 65% Syrah, 20% Zinfandel and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon pushes spicy cherry flavors ahead of earthy tannins set on a bed of rock. It's a fine, all-purpose barbeque red."
Stoller,Rosé,89.33,25.0,3,"This new Pinot is quite light in color, and hits the palate with a mix of tart cranberry and bitter herb. In 2012, a fruit-forward vintage, it seems slightly underripe, and thins out quickly."
Stolo,Chardonnay,93.0,26.0,1,"A minuscule amount of this wine was made, all of it fermented entirely in stainless steel. The result is lively in mouthcoating acidity and refreshing swirls of light-bodied mandarin orange and lime."
Stolo,Pinot Noir,91.67,34.83,6,"This untraditional blend works well, with the leathery 25% Merlot component restraining the boisterous fruit of the 75% Zinfandel. The nose mixes gravel, black-cherry blossom, mint and black cardamom, while the palate is both ripe and grippy, with olallieberries, plum-skin tannins, woody elderberries and vanilla bean. It's quite complex and dynamic."
Stolo,Sauvignon Blanc,88.5,25.0,2,"Complex and well balanced, this wine shows enticing aromas of fruits, spices and subtle herbs followed by tangy, dry, and slightly lean flavors like cranberry and rhubarb. It will be great with a roast fowl of some kind and should mellow more with time. Best after 2018."
Stolo,Syrah,95.0,40.0,2,"This release comes from the producer's own Durell Vineyard, specifically two blocks consistently used for this wine. Powerful ripeness and showy fruit rise on the nose and palate first, with an explosion of coconut water and burly oak. The wine was given 15 months in French oak, half of it new. Almonds, oranges and lemon rind combine before a dry finish. Drink now through 2021."
Stolpman,Red Blend,91.0,51.33,3,"The cherry, herb and barrel spice aromas are quite brooding at present. The fruit flavors are all about elegance of expression, showing pleasing complexities and plenty of hang time on the finish."
Stolpman,Roussanne,90.0,34.0,2,"Steely and perfumed, this wine sees only 20% new French oak, remaining vibrantly fresh. Baked apple and lemon pith veer into grapefruit on the palate, with spiciness to the finish that's both brash and loud."
Stolpman,Sangiovese-Syrah,90.0,66.0,2,"Orange blossoms, petrol and 7-Up aromas show on the soft but punchy nose from this single-vineyard bottling. The palate is texturally intriguing with a pithy grip, as dry flavors of tart apples, chalk and pink lemonade meld for a classic and age-worthy profile."
Stolpman,Syrah,93.0,52.67,12,"There's a preponderance of ripeness in this wine, the fruit tasting of baked blackberry and tar."
Stone The Crows,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.8,95.0,5,"A quite remarkable mauve-pink in color, this offers faint cherry aromas. It's nearly sweet on the palate, with strawberries and hard red berry candy flavors."
Stone Wolf,Pinot Noir,89.0,14.0,2,"Though the vintage helped create a lighter-than-usual version of this benchmark Pinot, it's beautifully crafted and fully realized. Like Burgundy, it disguises its power in a framework of elegantly defined fruits, acids and polished tannins. Cherry, plum, peach pit, pineapple and lemon oil notes are all in the mix. It's a wine that invites contemplation and rewards your time and attention."
StoneCap,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,9.5,2,"A stunning return to the quality that was seen in 2008, this superb effort bursts onto the palate with brambly berries, sweet herbs, coffee grounds and somewhat stiff, but polished, tannins. It's complex, with a touch of earthiness and generous length. The label reads Willamette Valley, though the vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA."
StoneCap,Chardonnay,85.25,9.75,4,"The best of a very fine flight of 2010 Pinots from Rex Hill, the La Colina offers a succulent mix of crushed flower, berry and liquid rock. The flavors meld beautifully, with vivid, lively acidity that brings a touch of grapefruit. The label reads Willamette Valley, though the vineyard is in the Dundee Hills AVA."
StoneCap,Merlot,85.0,9.0,3,"With its built-in ageability and instant flavor appeal, this bottling may be the favorite of all the 2010s from Bergström. It's complete and delicious, with muscle and depth—a mouth-pleasing mix of berry, cola, sandalwood and earth, plus exotic accents of incense and myrrh."
StoneCap,Riesling,85.67,9.0,3,"The Flying Pig is a blend of 60% Cabernet Franc and 40% Merlot. Bursting with a ripe, succulent cherry flavor, it offers layers of blackberry and spice, with floral highlights of talcum powder and rose. It's has a potpourri tone that dots the long, spicy finish. Perfect for ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce."
StoneCap,Syrah,87.25,9.25,4,"The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit. It's concentrated and deep, with appealing purity of flavor and the structure to age for over a decade."
Stonehedge,Chardonnay,91.0,35.0,1,"This 100% varietal wine comes off as quite ripe. Aromas of woodspice and caramel lead to full-bodied, sweet and quite boozy cherry flavors, with grainy tannins backing it all up."
Stonehedge,Meritage,89.0,42.5,2,"The oak, a mixture of French, American and Hungarian (with 50% new), takes the lead, with aromas of vanilla bean and toffee out in front of coffee and plum. The flavors are full bodied, sweet and generous, backed by grainy tannins."
Stonehedge,Zinfandel,88.0,25.0,1,"This 100% varietal wine offers aromas of barrel spices, mint, dried fruit and barnyard. It's full bodied but still shows good deftness."
Stonestreet,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.33,45.0,3,"The wood and alcohol seem to get out front of aromas of plum, raspberry and medicine cabinet. Flavors are sweet and concentrated with a tart, cranberry-filled finish. A lot of good things are going on but they don't quite seem to all come together."
Stonestreet,Chardonnay,92.33,40.0,3,"Made from a cool, steep site near the tiny town of Occidental, this white is lemony crisp and quite austere. A food-friendly wine suggestive of star fruit and just-ripe pineapple, it finishes somewhat spicy."
Stonestreet,Sauvignon Blanc,91.5,35.0,2,"Light and clear in color and texture, this wine opens in dirt and earth, along with a touch of baked strawberry. Smooth, juicy and long-lasting, it shows off the vintage's warmer leanings, and is medium bodied and densely lengthy."
Stony Hill,Chardonnay,92.0,45.0,1,"A field of mint is found on the nose of this soft, spicy wine with the gimmicky name, around a core of red cherry and touch of oak. Fresh and bright, it has a suggestion of heft on the finish."
Storm,Pinot Noir,92.4,55.0,5,"An elegant Syrah abundant in floral aromatics, demure in forward black and red fruit and a tinge of lavender. On the finish is pepper, the appropriate accent for a tastefully peppery meal."
Storm,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,35.0,1,"The 2010 BlackJack is loaded with tart cranberry and pomegranate fruit flavors. There is a streak of iron and darker notes that come through in earthy, slighted roasted tannins. The complexity is intriguing and adds depth to a rather light vintage."
Storm,Syrah,94.0,45.0,1,"An excellent Washington Malbec, this spicy delight sets up beautifully on the palate with bright, crisply defined, varietal fruit flavors of boysenberry, black cherry and cassis. Precise and penetrating, with excellent balance, it keeps the barrel flavors light and minimal."
Storybook Mountain,Zinfandel,90.0,50.0,1,"Good concentration and clear varietal flavors mark this excellent Washington Mourvèdre. The mixed red fruits are well integrated, with a strong vein of mineral, and a finishing wash of vanilla, coffee and chocolate. Lots of barrel flavors to be sure, but the fruit can take it."
Stottle,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.0,35.67,3,"Ripe fruit flavors of berry and plum are enveloped in spice-cake highlights. The citrus-infused acids bring in a hint of grapefruit and lemon. This is a complex wine, with fascinating components, and beginning to pull itself together."
Stottle,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,33.0,3,"This is a five-grape blend, with leafy flavors of garden-fresh herbs as well as ripe strawberries and vanilla cream. It's a smooth and immediately pleasing wine, with a velvety finish."
Stottle,G-S-M,89.0,36.0,1,"A Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Merlot, this bright and grapy effort pleasingly integrates slightly rougher notes of earth, leaf and stem. It all works here, adding texture and detail to the tart berry fruits. Drink in the next 3–5 years."
Stottle,Malbec,87.0,30.5,2,"This wine hits all the right notes—gamy spice, a touch of minerality, savory, rich fruit. A touch of oak adds muscle and the overall package is satisfying."
Stottle,Mourvèdre,91.0,32.0,1,"This opens bearing scents suggesting banana and tropical fruit, with an oily character. On the palate, the flavor veers toward sour apple, with tart acids. The finish brings in a lick of butter, but at the moment it doesn't quite come together. This may benefit from more bottle age."
Stottle,Red Blend,89.0,30.33,3,"The apple, pear and spice aromas and flavors display freshness. There is no apparent new oak influence, putting the focus on varietal purity. The finish lingers."
Stottle,Roussanne,85.5,24.0,2,"Heavily fragrant purple fruit, from baked blueberry to fresh boysenberry jam, meets with melted dark chocolate, black rocks and mint leaf-topped cola on the nose of this Tannat, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot blend. Blackberry juice, caramel cream and coffee flavors show on the palate that is laced with soft tannins and a ton of acidity."
Stottle,Sangiovese,87.0,28.0,1,"Barrel spice, violet, tobacco and earth aromas are followed by blue- and purple-fruit flavors, with the tannins showing a surprising amount of softness and suppleness for the variety. It's a mixture of intrigue and delivery, with a finish that glides."
Stottle,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,86.0,24.0,1,"Syrah takes the lead on this blend followed by a healthy dose of Mourvèdre. It's the latter that is initially evident, with generous white-pepper and meaty aromas followed by fresh flowers, raspberries and a touch of coffee. The red- and blue-fruit flavors show a fine sense of balance, with plenty of hang time on the finish."
Stottle,Syrah,88.6,29.6,5,"A blend of Syrah (59%) and Cabernet Sauvignon from mostly Upchurch and Ciel du Cheval vineyards, this wine offers reticent aromas of herbs, woodspice, mineral and dark fruit. The blackberry and black cherry flavors are plump and show a sense of balance, with slightly dry tannins providing some heft."
Stottle,Tempranillo,87.0,30.0,1,"Lime leaf, white peach and mineral aromas rise up from the glass, with botrytis adding a grace note. The spritzy stone fruit flavors are off dry and show spot on balance."
Stottle,Viognier,91.33,21.0,3,"Aromas of vanilla and baking spice are followed by ample red fruit and spice flavors. The acids are tart, giving the wine a zing."
Structure,Cabernet Franc,91.0,35.0,2,"An array of damp, dank herbs shows on the nose of this bottling from the Fairbairn Vineyard, with aromas of oregano, thyme, chaparral and moist earth. The palate is relatively light in body, showing flavors of oregano-crusted pork roast and a woody character."
Structure,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,38.0,1,"The chef returns to wine in this blend of mostly Chardonnay with 4% Viognier. A smooth, round and ripely agreeable quaff, it's thick in oak with a taste of vanilla."
Structure,Malbec,91.0,40.0,2,"There's a high-tone brightness of cassis and plum in this juicy, estate wine. A fruity character balances well against savory leather and black pepper that ride a thick wave of tannin."
Structure,Syrah,90.75,33.25,4,"Very deep color, potent aromas and a dense, but velvety texture paint a bold picture for this full-bodied wine. It has the drama and flavor recalling an expensive red, without overpowering tannins or a high price."
Stuessy Cellars,Petite Sirah,87.0,23.0,1,"Dry indeed; this is so dry as to be outright sour. It's an acid-lover's dream wine; but be prepared to pucker up. It's a mouthful of lemon juice, some cardboardy phenolics, and very tart green apples."
Stuessy Cellars,Red Blend,87.0,26.0,1,"Strongly herbal, with thin, very tart, acidic cranberry flavors."
Stuhlmuller Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,38.0,1,"Thin, dilute, with a minty, unripe character, and hard-as-nails tannins."
Stuhlmuller Vineyards,Chardonnay,88.0,25.0,1,"This annual study of Pomerol by the longtime California producer is a bit reserved and nearly austere on the nose, slowly revealing black coffee bean, tar, elderberry and herbs. Crushed herbs and bittersweet chocolate show once sipped, giving slight spice to the dense elderberry and blueberry fruit. It's still a bit wound-up, so drink 2018–2028."
Stuhlmuller Vineyards,Pinot Noir,91.0,58.0,2,"Stewed dark strawberry, cocoa, rust, muddy earth, crushed rocks and fennel brush show on the nose of this blend of 45% Grenache, 35% Mourvèdre, 17% Syrah and 3% Cinsault. Once sipped, flavors of red plum, mulberry and strawberry-balsamic reduction are prominent though delicate, edged with grippy tannins and touches of bittersweet chocolate."
Stuhlmuller Vineyards,Zinfandel,89.5,35.0,2,"Squeezed lime, tangerine rind and juice and yellow-grapefruit zest show on the sharply citrusy nose of this bottling, which is expertly rounded out by white peach and chalk. Light stone-fruit flavors of nectarine and apple blossom show first on the palate, which is cut by lemon juice and green grapefruit, and warmed up with sea salt, toast and walnut-oil touches."
Styring,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,45.0,2,"An expert blend of white Rhône varieties, this mix of 54% Grenache Blanc, 22% Viognier, 13% Picpoul Blanc and 11% Roussanne balances richness with sharpness perfectly. Aromas of honey, tangerine, creamy lily, tuberose and lemon blossoms lead into a palate full of yellow melon, yellow apple, sea salt, honeydew and even mango, all hung on a tense structure."
Styring,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,45.0,2,"This lavish yet regionally descriptive blend of 45% Merlot, 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot offers fresh-pressed blackberry, just-picked dill, graphite, tobacco ash and pencil lead on the nose. Dried-herb complexity shines on the palate, with swirling elements of oregano, bay leaf, thyme and tobacco layered across blackberry and blueberry fruit. There's the slightest barnyard touch too."
Styring,Pinot Noir,93.0,49.17,6,"This wine impresses in its succulence of black cherry and plum, the oak and tannin tamed and integrated to allow for a sensuality of texture along with such a boldness of flavor. Despite the concentration and ripeness, the wine is relatively light and easy to enjoy at the table."
Styring,Red Blend,89.0,40.0,1,"A bit lighter and less complex than Gavin Chanin's other bottlings this vintage, this wine is still impressively fresh, vibrant and may age better than the others. Aromas of red cherry, red plum, vanilla bean, wet slate, rose hips and a touch of fennel pop on the nose. The palate shows underripe cherry that's spiced by white pepper, dill, bay leaf, peppercorns and eucalyptus oil."
Styring,Riesling,91.33,31.67,3,"Aromas of iron, olive, herb, smoke, orange peel and savory notes are followed by a ripe, full savory palate that packs a punch. It's far from shy but manages to keep it all in balance."
SuLei,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.75,25.5,4,"From the Sebastopol Hills neighborhood, relatively cool and wind-affected, this wine has a compelling generosity, a full-bodied concentration that never gets bogged down. The hits of sandalwood, clove and pine provide a sultry edge."
SuLei,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,36.0,1,"This wine is half Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon (31%), Cabernet Franc (16%), Petit Verdot (2%) and Malbec. It draws you into the glass with high-toned aromas of dried herbs, espresso, red and black fruit, along with floral notes. The palate is poised and polished, showing depth, texture and layering well beyond its weight class. It appeals on every level."
SuLei,Red Blend,87.5,22.5,2,"The aromas pop on this blend of Alder Ridge Roussanne (57%) and Antoine Creek Viognier, with perfumed notes of flowers, pear and peach, along with light herb and spice grace notes. Palate coating, it brings a sense of gravitas and delight. It's fruitful and flavorful, offering richness while retaining its deftness, with a sense of texture that is knee buckling."
SuLei,Riesling,87.0,14.0,1,"Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine starts out quite aromatically closed up, with notes of brambly blue fruit and herbs, along with whiffs of orange peel and smoked meat. The flavors, in contrast, pop with electric notes of dark plum and huckleberry and lingering undercurrents of smoked meat and orange rind. Give it some time to open up and it delivers."
SuLei,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,18.0,1,"A light, cool vintage yields a fine and refined effort, offering a pretty mix of citrus, apple and melon fruit. It's underscored with balanced, lemony acids and a touch of minerality."
Suacci Carciere Wines,Pinot Noir,92.0,45.0,1,"Rich and ripe, with some Chardonnay-like power, it's a lush mix of tropical fruit flavors—guava and banana and more. A lovely vein of caramel runs across the palate, and makes this simply irresistible."
Substance,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.0,75.0,1,"Offering pronounced aromas of apricot fuzz, this is a pungent, slightly flabby white with a layer of unbalanced sweetness on the midpalate that lingers a long time."
Substance,Cabernet Franc,88.0,20.0,1,"This white is overtaken by alcohol, giving it a sharp taste of weight and oak over slight wafts of sour apple and honey."
Substance,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.67,30.5,6,"This Petite Sirah is deeply black in color and otherwise satisfactory though a bit disjointed, with an off-aroma of rubber peeking through."
Substance,Malbec,89.0,19.0,2,"With small percentages of Syrah and Viognier, this Petite Sirah is simple and has a pronounced smoky personality."
Substance,Merlot,91.33,39.33,3,"Sanguine, high-toned red fruit features prominently in this almost-equal blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Dusty tannin and a relatively light-bodied texture belie the power lurking beneath, the finish a hit of Red Hots and cherry cola."
Substance,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,20.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Grenache, Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris. Salmon colored, it offers light notes of red apple, melon and a hint of strawberry. The flavors are dry and generous, with a broad feel bringing a lot of appeal."
Summerland,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,25.0,2,"Winemaker Phillip Corallo-Titus of Chappellet works here with the great Sangiacomo family to make an affordably impressive wine, from the oldest blocks he can get. He coaxes toasted oak and nougat from a darkly colored, viscous texture and intensity of ripe apple and baked apricot, the ending rich and rewarding."
Summerland,Chardonnay,89.5,33.0,4,"A sly, subtle wine delicate in profile and character, this has acidity as its main star, and also playing a few supporting parts. Rhubarb, cranberry and orange lie atop more savory specks of cardamom and tea."
Summerland,Pinot Noir,89.57,56.43,7,"Milk chocolate, dark cherry, herb and floral notes are followed by silky smooth pit fruit flavors that linger."
Summerland,Sparkling Blend,88.0,30.0,1,"Grapes are sourced from St. Helena and Oakville for this light-bodied, tart and slightly herbal wine, blended with 8% Sémillon. Ripe and round, it's both floral and fruity, highlighted by melon and pear."
Summerland,Syrah,90.0,40.0,1,"Opulent fruit flavors and a good dose of vanilla and coconut give this full-bodied wine plenty of personality to go along with its heft and rich texture. Ripe pear, fig and melon notes mingle on a fresh, crisp structure."
Summers,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,54.8,10,"A lot selection; achingly dry but not just simple lemon juice. There's good concentration and a mix of mineral, rind, light citrus flesh, with excellent length and a finishing hint of honeysuckle."
Summers,Charbono,89.0,31.0,2,"Consistent with past vintages, this still-young wine has a yeasty nose, textural mouthfeel and light pear fruit flavors, gently dappled with cinnamon spice. There is just a hint of sweatiness in the finish."
Summers,Chardonnay,89.0,32.0,2,"A big-boy Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend (50% Cab Sauv, 40% Merlot, 10% Zinfandel) from the South Coast of California, offering up tones of cranberry, cassis and even a hint of eucalyptus, that's stemmy and tannic with room to mellow with age."
Summers,Merlot,90.0,45.0,1,"Rhubarb, strawberries and a strong streak of citrus and orange peel are the dominant flavors here. This reflects the cool vintage, finishing with tart, citrusy acids."
Summers,Zinfandel,86.0,42.5,2,"The Treehouse spent 18 months in 15% new French oak, and has light flavors of cherry and root beer. The tannins are earthy with astringent, green tea flavors, and a hint of stem in the finish."
Summerwood,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,60.0,2,"Among the early releases of the 2011 single-vineyard Pinots from Torii Mor, the Olson seems to be the one that had the most difficulty achieving full ripeness. Scents and flavors are focused upon green tea, peppery herbs, even a suggestion of fiddlehead ferns. The fruit reaches rhubarb-level ripeness and remains there, but the balance and structure are first-rate."
Summerwood,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,60.0,2,"A mouth-filling red that's dry and chewy in tannins, with a dark berry core surrounded by roasted herbs and earth. Lush on the palate it's in balance and well-made, from a relatively cool growing region near the Sacramento Delta."
Summit Lake,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.5,65.0,2,"These are the oldest Pinot vines on the property, planted in 1999. A mix of Pommard, Wadenswil and Dijon clones, they create a rather sharp, herbal wine, with earthy tannins and a hint of bitterness. Barrel aging adds some baking chocolate flavors, but additional bottle age is recommended."
Summit Lake,Petite Sirah,87.0,55.0,1,"Outside of a couple of Michigan wineries, Adelsheim may be the only domestic producer of this obscure white grape, a cross between Pinot Noir and Gouais Blanc. This aromatic, European-styled wine carries scents of pear and citrus, with crisp fruit flavors buoyed by a bracing minerality."
Summit Lake,Zinfandel,86.0,37.5,2,"This barrel selection actually was given less exposure to new French oak than the estate bottling, a telling fact, which demonstrates Anam Cara's commitment to fruit and terroir. Elegant and charming, it links pomegranate, raspberry and cherry fruit to silky tannins, achieving a lovely purity of expression in a year of moderate ripeness."
Suncé Vineyard & Winery,Malvasia Bianca,87.0,20.0,1,"Among all the latest 2009 releases from Andrew Will, the Ciel du Cheval is the most shuttered and in need of further bottle age. Tight and tannic, it is unusually herbal for this hot climate site. Even after many hours of breathing time, it remains stubbornly closed. Given the vineyard history and winery credentials, it seems highly likely to improve significantly with more time."
Suncé Vineyard & Winery,Meritage,87.0,48.0,1,"Sleek, elegant and refined, this is a subtle, evocative and seamless wine. Layers of plum and black cherry, cola and earth, sea salt and caramel entwine gracefully. The 18 months in oak brings in sweet baking spices. Delicious already, it should drink very well at least through 2025."
Sutro,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,47.0,1,"Ripe and luscious, this coats the mouth with a mélange of juicy apples and peaches. That initial hit is followed up with a wash of buttery, toasted nuts, and finally kissed away with a lick of wet stone. It's creamy and rich without ever being tiring."
Sutro,Merlot,90.0,35.0,1,"An estate wine from an elevated elevation, this opens in fragrant red cherry and vanilla, with a subtle trace of brambly blackberry. Soft, it features a supple mouthfeel, medium weight and a backbone of structure, earthy and enticing. Easily enjoyable now, it should take on added complexity through 2022."
Svago Buono,White Blend,89.0,39.0,1,"Chalky tannins and subdued fruit and tannin weight make this an inviting, food-friendly wine, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Made from estate vineyards, it's rich in black cherry and dark chocolate, concentrated and layered. It ends in a spicy back note of pepper. Cellar through 2022."
Swanson,Mission,90.0,140.0,1,"Christmas-like aromas of juniper, pine and forest floor hit the nose hard on this bottling from the historic vineyard, all leveled by fresh squeezed pomegranate juice, wild sweet mint and pencil shavings. A woody character reminiscent of uncured sandalwood powers the palate, which also shows cranberry juice and pipe tobacco in the background."
Swedish Hill,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,25.0,1,"The winery's multiple vineyard designates are very good, but the blending that goes into this Winemaker's Cuvée puts it right there with the best of them. Bursting with blueberry, cherry and plum scents and flavors, this complex and complete wine piles on the details. A streak of chocolate here, a dash of cumin there, and on it goes."
Swedish Hill,Chardonnay,83.0,17.0,1,"Larry Stanton patiently waits to release the wines he grows to very low yields in calcareous soils. The results are rich, in this case offering heavy, intoxicating aromas of kirsch, extracted cherries and a Bourbon-esque caramel element. Smoky tobacco and blackberry juice notes arises on the palate, with fresh laid asphalt flavors popping up on the finish."
Sweet Cheeks,Merlot,85.0,23.0,1,"Intense aromatics seduce with a pungent mix of earth, leather, truffle and tobacco. Just-ripe wild berries, tea leaves and dried herbs join the chorus, while sweet tannins frame a lingering finish that invites further exploration."
Sweet Cheeks,Pinot Noir,87.0,51.67,3,"This is locked up tight when opened, and remains massive but inscrutable for several hours. But that is not to say it isn't a killer wine. The dense weave of wild berries, Mediterranean herbs, earth and clay signals a powerful wine with serious aging potential. Drink 2018 through 2028."
Sweet Cheeks,Red Blend,84.0,18.0,1,"Juicy strawberries, raspberries and plums are balanced by wet slate on the nose of this wine from grape growing pioneer Louis Lucas and his vintner-partner, Judge Royce Lewellen. The palate shows more raspberry and a bit of boysenberry along with an orange rind tartness and woody herbs like juniper and black sage."
Sweet Cheeks,Syrah,86.33,39.67,3,"If this delicious bottling is any indication, this region is prime for Malbec. Aromas of grape soda, black slate, turned loam, blueberry and purple flowers make for a nicely even nose, and the palate is rich and full with balanced tannins. The juicy flavors include black cherries, plums, cassis and blueberry extract, to which crushed, dried herbs give necessary nuance."
Sweet Cheeks,Tempranillo,86.5,25.0,2,"This is a lovely wine, with flavors both rich and racy—cool minerality meets ripe lemon/lime, with a dollop of creamy custard. It's mouthfilling and smooth, with lingering, delicious flavors that resonate beautifully."
Sweet Valley Wines,Red Blend,85.0,20.0,1,"While slightly reserved in aroma, this serious, special-occasion wine comes on steady and strong in flavor. Blueberry and black cherry notes pick up more raspberry and red cherry with each sip. In addition to fruit complexity, it has a full body, sleek texture and lingering finish. Best now through 2020."
Sweetzer Cellars,Chardonnay,89.0,40.0,1,"Pretty aromatically, Lava Cap's Battonage has inviting flavors of pear, honey and toasty vanilla. With well-integrated oak, it's a classically robust California Chardonnay, weighty but structured."
Sweetzer Cellars,Pinot Noir,92.33,48.33,3,"Sourced from a 2001 planting of Dijon clone 777 vines, this is a dry, slightly leathery wine with tight flavors of dried figs dusted with cocoa and coffee grounds. It shows moderate depth and length, and seems ready for near-term drinking."
Swick,Grenache,90.0,22.0,1,This powerful wine is sourced from 100-year-old vines in the famous Deaver vineyard. There's a touch of pepper behind the thick tannins and oak. It's a long lasting wine with leathery blackberry fruit that should come to the fore over time.
Swick,Pinot Noir,90.0,29.5,2,"Pale rose in color, this soft, tasty wine seems to be moving quickly along the aging curve. It spent some time in 30% new French oak, cloaking its flavors of rhubarb pie in highlights of cracker and milk chocolate. Drink this sooner rather than later."
Swiftwater Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.86,48.86,7,"The scents mingle rose petals, sandalwood and a touch of bitter greens. That dusting of incense continues on the palate, with Indian spices and tart red fruit. Tannins are firm and proportionate, with a bit of stem flavoring the finish."
Swiftwater Cellars,Bordeaux-style White Blend,88.0,32.0,2,"This tight, young Syrah has a succinct core of blueberry and raspberry flavors, which are wrapped in a mix of herb, earth and green tea. The tannins are just slightly bitter, but all in balance, and that bitterness is not at all unpleasant."
Swiftwater Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.86,51.71,7,"The addition of 20% Roussanne to the blend seems to thicken the palate—which is not a bad thing at all. A scent of honeysuckle piles on top of the flavors of honey, chamomile tea, lemon, orange and pink grapefruit, creating a luscious wine with impressive length."
Swiftwater Cellars,Chardonnay,87.25,21.5,4,"The Hellion is half Primitivo, one-third Petite Sirah and the rest Zinfandel. A lively mix of berry, citrus and tree fruit flavors, it's plush, forward and full across the palate. It starts out beautifully, then falls a little flat coming into the home stretch. The finish shows some heat and a hint of milk chocolate."
Swiftwater Cellars,Merlot,90.0,35.0,2,"This blend of many vineyard lots seems less than the sum of its parts. Pungently herbal with characteristic Oregon tomato leaf tannins, its fruit remains hidden beneath the tannins. Age may enhance its beauty, but for the moment it remains tight and unyielding, with suggestions of heat around the cranberry/pomegranate fruit."
Swiftwater Cellars,Riesling,88.5,20.0,4,"Fruit sourced from Red Mountain's top vineyards––Ciel du Cheval, Klipsun and Kiona––comes on rich and fruity, with big and powerful black cherry and cassis interwoven with threads of smoke, coffee, graphite and baking chocolate. Deep, dark and dense."
Swiftwater Cellars,Rosé,86.0,25.0,1,"A Sierra Foothills Sauvignon Blanc with incredibly inviting aromatics of grass, grapefruit and melon that evolves into a delicious texture that's light, dry and yet still somehow rich with crisp acidity. So good for summer and fall."
Swirl,Malbec,85.0,18.0,1,"This meaty, gamy wine is 84% Mourvèdre, and marries its earthy flavors to the ripe black fruit of the Syrah. The two mix well, but could use a bit more bottle time to fully integrate. Blood, meat, cassis, and smoke mingle, and some heat slips in at the end, along with rich coffee grounds and dark chocolate. Big, flavorful, lingering."
Syncline,Cinsault,91.0,35.0,1,"This estate bottling showcases ripe apple and melon fruit, spiced with sweet barrel notes and toast. The wine spent some months in 20% new French oak."
Syncline,Grenache Blanc,89.75,27.75,4,"Big, bold and brawny, this wine from a very famous vineyard shows off its savory edge with tufts of clove, leather, gun smoke and tea, providing the requisite dustiness on the palate for which the region is known. Medium bodied and integrated well, it represents the vintage and region in all good ways."
Syncline,Grüner Veltliner,89.25,25.0,4,"Made from half Merlot and half Petite Sirah, and aged in French oak, only 30% of it new, this wine shows well in a dusting of mocha powder and blackberry, the flavors built around a thick, dense torso of soft tannins. Succulent, it's full bodied but well mannered and easy to enjoy."
Syncline,Marsanne,88.0,26.0,1,"A richly layered white, this wine opens in butterscotch and mango, making no bones about its ripeness and voluptuous nature. Acidity saves the day and keeps the proceedings from getting out of hand, allowing the finish to find balance."
Syncline,Mourvèdre,92.0,36.67,3,"This is a generous white from the famous vineyard site, robust in toasted oak and big flavors of butterscotch and vanilla. Youthful, it opens in the glass to find more of its ripe fruit, from Gravenstein apple to baked pear."
Syncline,Picpoul,91.0,25.0,1,"This is a nicely sour, flinty and balanced full-bodied wine from a cool-climate site. Despite its roundness and warmth, this finds a way to be light and lean in between the luxuriousness and generous nature of the vintage and style."
Syncline,Pinot Noir,89.0,25.0,1,"The producer's proprietary blend of 89% Sauvignon Blanc, 10% Chardonnay and 1% Muscat, this wine is fresh and fiery, bright on the palate in apple, Asian pear and jicama, with a dusting of dried herb and ginger as it goes down."
Syncline,Red Blend,92.2,32.2,5,"A 100% varietal wine, this offers a juiciness of red fruit that's deliciously inviting, surrounded by plenty of cinnamon and black pepper. Grippy and full bodied, it reins in its ripeness well, remaining structured and complex through a mineral-driven finish."
Syncline,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.57,29.57,7,"Arguably the iconic vineyard at Rex Hill, Jacob-Hart brings subtle nuances into play from older vines and biodynamic techniques. There's lots to enjoy here—hints of spice, earth, even hemp, along with the core fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry. It's just a little thinner than usual in this new vintage."
Syncline,Rosé,89.0,24.0,2,"From the winery most responsible in America for popularizing this style of Sauvignon Blanc, this vintage delivers savory, lemony goodness, within a light-to-medium-bodied frame. Integrated and round on the palate, it's a great wine for the table."
Syncline,Sparkling Blend,92.0,30.0,1,"From Block 29 of the acclaimed vineyard, this wine is delightfully juicy and flirty in black cherry, leather, black pepper and tobacco. Full bodied and ripe, it never gets heavy, rather trafficking in enough acidity and sense of place to stay grounded on the palate."
Syncline,Syrah,91.82,41.36,11,"One of Schramsberg's younger releases, and made from all white grapes, this wine has tantalizing aromas of vanilla, apple and light toast that lead to layered and creamy flavors. A nice brisk balance with good acidity underlies the spice and fruit."
Syncline,Viognier,91.0,20.0,2,"Estate grown and aged in 31% new barrels, this offers dense purple fruits, scents of violets and mocha, and a smoky thread that carries into the finish. There are strong flavors of cedar box and graphite, and the tannins are chewy and substantial."
Syncline,White Blend,89.0,19.0,2,"This wine is a blend of 87% Petite Sirah and Zinfandel. The aromas of herb, graphite, barrel spice, plum and cranberry seem a bit muddled. The palate offers tart fruit flavors, with plenty of wood influence mixed in."
Syzygy,Red Blend,91.5,45.0,2,"Light in color, the aromas of this wine are very varietal, with scents of cranberry, raspberry and high-toned spices. The palate is quite sweet, giving the appearance of carrying some residual sugar. It comes off as a bit hot. Still, there's enjoyment to be had."
Séamus Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,88.0,1,"This wine has yummy, fresh fruit aromas and flavors and a supple texture. The cherry, raspberry and plum notes are easy to savor due to medium body, light tannins and rather soft acidity."
Séamus Wines,Pinot Noir,88.0,57.0,2,"This is a light-bodied, very fruity and soft-textured wine that smells like cherries, berries and melons and tastes fresh and a touch sweet. The acidity is low and the bubbles are lively, so it's easy to sip."
Séamus Wines,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,29.0,1,"There are copious amounts of earth and herbs on the nose of this blend of 28% Merlot, 28% Sangiovese, 22% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Carmenere, 6% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot, showing baked earth, red bell pepper and leather. It's soft and easy on the palate, with red fruit and that peppery pyrazine touch, making for a solid weeknight pizza wine."
T.A.T.T,Red Blend,89.0,18.0,1,"Gritty like fruit leather, with a perceived sweetness of plum candy and red licorice, this wine is wide and expansive on the palate, with grippy, persistent tannins. The oak is dominant and pushy on the palate, unsettled somewhat in its integration."
T.W. Fermentation,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,64.0,2,"More earthy and herbal than fruity, this medium-bodied wine from Calaveras County tastes rich and round on the palate and has a subtle savory character. With two-and-a-half years of aging before release, it shows the nicely mellowing effect of time."
TH,Grenache-Syrah,89.0,55.0,1,"This is a very ripe-tasting broadly textured wine that's full bodied and fruity. Plum and prune aromas precede jammy, grapey flavors with light spicy accents. Blended from Zinfandel, Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's soft in mouthfeel and low in acidity and tannins."
TH,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,55.0,1,"This is a rich, fairly dry and flavorful wine that has baking spice and chocolate aromas, cocoa-dusted plum flavors and a broad softly tannic texture that adds a good bite."
TH,Syrah,94.0,80.0,1,"This bottling's slightly dank nose recalls the front lawn being cut on a hot summer day, but a warmer, more inviting peach and nectarine fruit component awaits in the background. The palate is tangy with sharp lime peels and a bit tarry."
TR Elliott,Pinot Noir,94.0,46.0,1,"Medium-pink in color, apple and berry aromas are followed by spritzy, moderately sweet fruit flavors. It goes down easy."
Tablas Creek,Mourvèdre,91.0,40.0,1,"This is a soft vineyard-designate, approachable and flirting with overripe flavors that rein in accents of soy, brown sugar and Dr Pepper."
Tablas Creek,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.11,41.67,9,"The aromas on this wine are quite unusual, with notes of wet copper penny, fresh sage and raspberry. Meanwhile the cranberry and cherry flavors are sweet and concentrated, creating an uneasy juxtaposition."
Tablas Creek,Rhône-style White Blend,90.43,33.86,7,"Light in color, this blend of 51% Syrah, 42% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon is perfumed with orange peel, coffee, plum and herbs. It drinks off dry, quite light and elegant in style with grainy tannins."
Tablas Creek,Rosé,88.75,24.75,4,"A smokiness rises to the fore initially in this wine, a toasted oak accent that marks its character. From there, sour cherry and grenadine mix for an earthy celebration of red fruit before this full-bodied wine presents its tannins on the finish."
Tablas Creek,Roussanne,87.0,35.0,1,"Juicy ripe blackberry and raspberry form the basis of this brambly, fruit-forward Zin that offers a low output of tannin and oak presence. Refined on the palate, it finishes with a swat of wild licorice and dried herb."
Tablas Creek,Vermentino,88.0,27.0,1,"Stewed black plum and tangy black cherry fruit meet baking spice and cola on the nose of this bottling from Lompoc-based Brian Loring. The palate is tangy with black cherry and cranberry, with a touch of herbs and forest floor."
Table No. 7,Chardonnay,87.0,11.0,2,"Inspired by co-winemaker Eli Parker's trips to Australia, this is simply a fun and tasty sparkling red, with rose, clove, black plum, and graphite notes on the nose. Ripe berry flavors round out the palate, but tangy plum skins and a slate-driven mineral tension keep it serious."
Tagaris,Chenin Blanc,87.0,16.0,1,"Plush blackberry, fennel, mocha, char and peppercorn aromas show on the nose of this bottling from longtime friends Paul Quinn and James Schreiner. Dried plum skin, cherry and elderberry flavors show on the palate, which is layered with tannins and turns savory with charred beef, charcoal and tobacco flavors."
Tagaris,Counoise,87.0,28.0,1,"From a site near Annapolis, this wine shows a preponderance of dark grape and cherry flavor interwoven with cinnamon and black peppercorn. Light-bodied and ethereally layered, it has touches of rustic earthiness and leather."
Tagaris,Johannisberg Riesling,88.0,8.0,1,"The first aromas that emerge from this blend of Bordeaux varieties with a “California twist” are dried chaparral herb, espresso, black currant and pepper. Cocoa flavors are prominent on the palate, with tangy cranberry, pomegranate and richer dried black cherry fruit."
Tagaris,Malbec,89.0,30.0,2,"A light-bodied take on the variety, this wine imparts shocks of sage, lavender and mint aromas over a landscape of black and white pepper and dried herb flavors."
Tagaris,Petit Verdot,86.0,28.0,1,"This wine opens with the fresh liveliness of stemmy earth and black tea notes, growing funkier and more herbal on the midpalate. Brightly layered and deeply flavored, it's a full-bodied rendition that remains true to its variety."
Tagaris,Red Blend,85.67,33.33,3,"This is a vibrant take on the grape, with fresh-pressed boysenberry and wisteria aromas merging with rosemary, fennel and sarsaparilla on the nose. Food friendly, it shows more boysenberry, thyme, white pepper, and floral freshness on the palate."
Taken Wine Co.,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,40.0,1,"Nutty and lush with layers of peach, pear and lime fruit, this is a medium-bodied and well-balanced white. It's refreshing while offering both length and breadth on the palate."
Taken Wine Co.,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,90.0,30.0,2,"Reserve it may be, but it is a thin wine nonetheless, with hard, green flavors and a stemmy, tannic finish. —P.G.  Sangiovese"
Taken Wine Co.,Chardonnay,90.5,18.0,4,"Just four barrels were produced of this reserve, which sports a distinctive black label. The fruit is chunky and scented strongly with cinnamon. Even with extended airing, the wine feels diffuse, and the flavors thin out rather quickly. A bit disappointing given the vintage."
Taken Wine Co.,Pinot Noir,87.0,20.0,1,"Peppery, grapey flavors, full body and a rich fine-grained texture make this wine distinctive to taste and soothing to drink. It's a very good example of a GSM, capturing the fullness and generosity of this type of blend made from Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre grapes."
Taken Wine Co.,Red Blend,88.0,20.0,1,"Vanilla and caramel show right away on the nose of this bottling, followed by stewed blackberry and black plum sauce, proving quite jammy but layered with burnt sugar aromas. Blackberry pie in a vanilla crust is the flavor that pops on the palate, along with black plum and all manner of purple fruit and flower."
Taken Wine Co.,Rhône-style Red Blend,86.0,20.0,1,"Very light and summery on the nose, this bottling shows aromas of yellow melon, green pear, lime blossoms, lime juice and a touch of chalk. Wet rocks, cut garden herbs and green apple skins emerge on the refreshing palate, which is perfect for sunny days and shellfish."
Talbott,Chardonnay,90.33,44.33,15,"Tight and fresh aromas of Asian pear, honeysuckle and key lime pie converge on this sparkler from a new estate in Temecula. The palate shows sliced apples, yellow pears, ripe nectarine, rounder white peach and even creamy cherimoya flavors. Though the region is known more for almond-flavored sparklers, they seem to do regular bubbles well."
Talbott,Pinot Noir,91.33,43.67,12,"Cherry syrup and wet chewing tobacco aromas make for a unique nose. There is good acidity and decent tannic structure, but the dried cherry flavors are quite light for the strong scents."
Talisman,Pinot Noir,90.64,58.91,22,"Planks of brawny oak are framed around the blueberry and raspberry fruit brimming in this Merlot, a tribute to Jack London's once-home in nearby Glen Ellen. The herbal component lingers ominously, a refreshing taste of mint popping out on the finish."
Talley,Chardonnay,92.39,40.17,18,"A moderately aromatic wine with notes of green herb, citrus and cherry. It's medium bodied with chalky tannins and abundant mocha flavors with the concentration seeming a bit lacking."
Talley,Pinot Noir,91.3,54.3,10,"This Reserve Series bubbly accents its crisp green apple fruit with toasty aromas. Done via Méthode Champenoise, it spent five years en tirage. There's a fine bead and lingering persistent flavors with hints of nutmeg and lemon curd. All in all, this is a very fine effort."
Tamarack Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.5,49.58,12,"A blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon and 32% Merlot, this offers aromas of high-toned red fruit, French-oak spice and herbs that lead to luxurious but still in-check dark-fruit flavors. Tart black-tea accents persist on the finish."
Tamarack Cellars,Counoise,90.0,30.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. There's freshness to the fruit, with aromas of cherry and raspberry kissed by herb, clove and spice. The flavors are lush and palate-coating, with the tannins bringing a touch of astringency that hopefully will settle out with additional time in the bottle."
Tamarack Cellars,Mourvèdre,86.5,15.5,2,"This broad-textured, complex and indulgent Rhône-style blend has cedar, cola and blackberry aromas and concentrated fruit, earth and spice flavors. Milk chocolate richness emerges on the midpalate and plays through the finish."
Tamarack Cellars,Petit Verdot,94.0,30.0,1,"This lovely, full-bodied white offers generous caramel apple and baked pear flavors cradled in toasted oak that brings nutmeg and vanilla aspects. The rich roundness finds refreshment on the finish in stony acidity."
Tamarack Cellars,Red Blend,90.2,27.4,10,"This softly textured wine explodes with chocolate and strawberry flavors, a bright streak of acidity keeping its ripeness in check. Low in oak impact, it shows cigar and black licorice seasonings as it opens in the glass."
Tamarack Cellars,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.33,28.0,3,"A plush texture and oodles of tasty berry and cherry flavor make this medium-bodied wine hard to resist. Scents of pine forest, wild blackberries and mellow spices like nutmeg and clove give it complexity. The mouthfeel is smooth and supple, and the finish is soft and lingering."
Tamarack Cellars,Syrah,91.0,37.0,4,"A dynamic balance between ripe, juicy fruit flavors and crisp acidity makes this medium-bodied wine both refreshing and substantive. It smells like a bowl of sliced melons, apples and grapes. After 79% Pinot Gris, the winemaker blends in Roussanne, Grüner Veltliner and a bit of Chardonnay."
Tamber Bey,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.0,115.0,1,"Fully caramelized in oak, this wine shows flavors of ripe baked apple and pear within a full-bodied, concentrated style that's completely satisfying. Well made and tasty, it finishes in a swirl of Tahitian vanilla and crème brûlée."
Tamber Bey,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.33,55.0,3,"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also holds 4% of Malbec and 4% of Merlot, a hearty yet elegant showing of the appellation. Herbal sage and cedar combine with a waft of peppercorn and tobacco leaf to make for an inviting entry, before soft, approachable layers of black fruit enter the scene. The finish all about dark chocolate."
Tamber Bey,Chardonnay,89.8,46.6,5,"Syrupy thick at first, decadent enough for a king, this rich red is defined by vanilla French toast and blackberry jam aromas and flavors. It finds balance midway through on the palate, veering into crisper red tones of cranberry and rhubarb. Time will help mellow things out. Cellar through 2020."
Tamber Bey,Merlot,89.0,75.0,1,"From a knoll in Carneros, oft thought of as chilly for Cabernet, this wine exhibits cooler aspects of the variety, from pencil lead and cedar to dried herb. It is complemented by fruitier characteristics of cassis and plum, finishing in dusty, structured tannins. Cellar through 2017–2020."
Tamber Bey,Pinot Noir,90.0,75.0,1,"Dried black cherries, cola, root beer, black rocks and a hint of tarragon swirl into a lovely nose on this rarely used varietal. The palate offers clean blackberry and plum juice, with a minty lift reminiscent of camphor and eucalyptus."
Tamber Bey,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,32.0,4,"The partnership between vintner Bill Price and winemaker Gavin Chanin, Lutum continues to impress, aiming for elegance without giving up flavor or body. Tightly wound, a signature perhaps of the vintage, this wine is still subtle, suggesting rhubarb and cherry atop forest floor. Smooth, it hides elusive power on the significant finish."
Tamás Estates,Barbera,91.0,28.0,1,"Ripe black cherry and vanilla swirl around notes of cedar and dusty tannins, combining seamlessly on the palate. From an appellation not known for the variety, it does justice to mountain fruit and power, finishing with substance."
Tangent,Albariño,88.6,20.0,5,"The dark raspberry, plum, herb, vanilla and spice aromas and flavors are rich and high octane. It's not for the faint of heart but offers plenty of appeal."
Tangent,Pinot Gris,87.33,17.0,3,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (58%), Merlot (39%) and Petit Verdot, this wine offers aromas of café au lait, dried herbs, butterscotch, woodspice and cherry. The barrel flavors provide much of the appeal, along with a silky feel."
Tangent,Sauvignon Blanc,88.5,17.75,4,"Aromas of black and white pepper and raw meat are redolent on this wine. The palate is all about feel, freshness and texture, without a trace of new wood in sight and a finish that lingers. It's a unique example of the variety that focuses on subtlety and nuance."
Tangent,Viognier,88.0,17.0,2,"This wine is 29% each Mourvèdre and Syrah with the rest equal parts Cinsault, Counoise and Grenache. Aromas of vanilla, coconut and red and black fruit lead to a full-bodied, creamy palate that mixes fruit and barrel flavors. The wood influence is strong but the fruit largely stands up to it."
Tangley Oaks,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,24.0,1,"Fully ripe, saturated fruit aromas lead to deep, lush flavors and a smooth, moderately tannic texture. The wine lets dried plum flavors shine through without a lot of oak tones, so it tastes focused and pure. It keeps improving with each sip. Best now through 2019."
Tangley Oaks,Pinot Noir,87.0,21.5,2,"Copper-pink in color, this sparkling blend of half Chardonnay, 42% Pinot Noir and 8% Pinot Meunier is coy on the nose, pulled back and restrained in apple and lime aromas. Flavor-wise, it offers a medium-build up of strawberries and cream."
Tank Garage,Red Blend,88.0,45.0,1,Dark color and a severe tartness make this wine challenging on the palate. It's overripe in terms of tropical fruit and bogged down by a sourness that's hard to shake. Let it open and pair it with creamy foods like goat cheese to get it to behave.
Tanner,Barbera,91.0,32.0,1,"There's plenty of appeal to this well-priced wine with its aromas of flowers, pear and ice tea. It drinks off dry, with the flavor concentration lighter in style."
Tanner,Carignane,89.0,28.0,1,"The aromas of almond and spice are quite light and elusive on this wine, while the sweet fruit flavors seem dilute."
Tanner,Petite Sirah,91.0,35.0,2,"A bit dull on the nose, this wine offers smoky, toasty blackberry and bacon around a soft body and short finish, making it fine for casual gatherings and barbecues."
Tanner,Red Blend,86.5,41.5,2,"As is often the case, the Estates Syrah bottling is the best wine of the flight in this vintage. It shows more varietal character and depth, with a substantial black-cherry flavor. It has lavish notes of maple syrup and baking spices, and the core fruit still shines through."
Tanner,Vermentino,87.0,20.0,1,"The aromatic opening suggests tea and tobacco, while the palate is packed with blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit. This wine has density and complexity yet it's smooth, superrich, toasty and chocolaty. It manages to retain a sense of finesse along with all that power."
Tanner DaFoe,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,75.0,1,"The multiple discoveries (the forgotten vines, the monks' secret recipe) behind Deborah Hall's project are fascinating enough, yet the golden orange wine is also utterly delicious. Old Fashioned cocktail-like aromas of maraschino cherry and orange rind mix with roasted nuts and a touch of brandy on the nose. Flavors of simmered honey, buttery whiskey and pear reduction entertain the palate, which benefits from remarkable acidity and grip, achieving utmost balance for a dessert wine."
Tanner DaFoe,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,93.0,75.0,1,"From one of three estate-farmed vineyards belonging to the producer, Bone Ash is dry-farmed and planted to old vines in volcanic soils, the minerality of which is divinely present in this wine. High-toned, balanced in acidity and softly structured, it offers a range of fruit, from sharp cranberry to jammy blackberry, changing in the glass over time. Complex and layered, it will cellar well through 2022."
Tantara,Chardonnay,90.33,49.33,6,"Complex, classy winemaking is evident from the first sniff to the final sip. Savory notes of green tea and clean earth complement a terroir-driven wine. The notes and nuances pile on—flowers and fruits, cherry and cassis, with a whiff of barnyard and undergrowth. The lingering, expressive finish is already boggling, and seems sure to continue to evolve gracefully through 2025–2030."
Tantara,Pinot Noir,91.61,63.7,23,"The Sigrid never fails to deliver lush fruit and hedonistic barrel flavors. However in cooler years, when the alcohol falls below 14%, it has something extra when details of skin and flower emerge as well. This is a wine of power and finesse, with juicy pear and peach, supple acids, brioche and toasted biscuit, underscored with refreshing minerality. Drink now through 2025."
Taplin Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,65.0,1,"This incredibly tasty wine seems to melt in the mouth. Classic aromas of cinnamon, black cherry and cedar becomes more chocolaty on the palate as layers of cocoa, dark plum and toasted baguette unfold. Its texture is so velvety that the fine-grained tannins seem to dissolve as you sip, while still providing a slight grip that counteracts the richness and full body. Tempting now, it will be best 2022–2032."
Tapteil Vineyard,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,37.0,2,"An all-encompassing and earthy richness on the nose of this wine blends dried strawberry, Bing cherry and sour cherry fruits with damp herbs like dewy sagebrush and dark chocolate bars. It's thick once sipped, with ripe raspberry and dried cherry fruits. Spicy fennel and cardamom arrives on the midpalate, finishing with a zing of Sichuan peppercorn and shiitake mushrooms."
Tapteil Vineyard,Mourvèdre,89.0,34.0,1,"Richly buttered Bing cherries, plums, licorice, black pepper and a loamy mud minerality show on the nose of this bottling by winemaker Scott Shirley. The palate truly shines, with flavors of chocolate syrup-covered cherries rolled in fresh mint, espresso beans, charred pine and tannins that wake up the mouth and hold its attention."
Tapteil Vineyard,Riesling,92.0,17.0,1,"A stunning blend of half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir, made in a méthode traditionelle, this is a dry, minerally and incredibly smooth sparkling wine. Elegant and refined, it offers a tightly drawn curtain of mousse that lingers on the palate. The time in bottle has added complexity and sophistication, making the wine enjoyable now or for several more years."
Tapteil Vineyard,Syrah,90.0,27.0,1,"This wine combines fruit from both cool and warm sites, which in the vintage might have both leaned on the warmer side. Black fruit and licorice give it a burly character at first. Decanting or letting the wine open in the glass will help, but still it retains smooth, velvety tannins and resolved oak."
Tara Bella,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,78.0,1,"Only the second vintage of this vineyard-designate wine from an estate property, this bottling offers spicy cherry, black tea and dried herb, backed by oaky backbone and structure. Dark chocolate and leather play on the palate in subtle waves, hitting their strides on the finish. Cellar through 2020."
Tatomer,Grüner Veltliner,90.0,25.0,1,"Floral and herbal from the get-go, this medium-bodied white from a great vineyard offers a lot to like. Stainless-steel fermentation gives it a lean underbelly, rounded out by sharp Meyer lemon and tangerine, buoyed by mouthwatering acidity. Green apple and an accent of honey peak on the finish."
Tatomer,Riesling,92.0,25.0,1,"Light in color and weight, this vineyard-designate conveys a wealth of rose petals, earth and bright, crisp red cherry. Compellingly layered and shy, it defines the term ethereal. The finish is medium in length and accented in spicy cardamom."
TeBri Vineyards,Pinot Noir,85.0,28.0,2,"A Zin with 23% Petite Sirah, this wine is seamless. Full bodied and dark, it is complexly layered in tobacco, meaty bacon and game, with a touch of brown sugar. A floral bouquet lurks underneath. Sourced from a vineyard with 100-plus-year-old vines, it finishes dusty and dramatic."
Tedeschi Family,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,70.0,1,"Stemmy, baked earth is wrapped around a substantial core of oak and dense tannin in this ripe, savory wine. A wealth of baking spices, from nutmeg to cardamom, plays off the lurking layers of rich black cherry and baked strawberry, giving the taste experience an exotic edge. Enjoy through 2020."
Tedeschi Family,Chardonnay,82.0,45.0,1,"Starr Ridge is a two-block site originally planted by winemaker Gary Farrell and farmed by Ulises Valdez. This Cooper Block is incredibly structured and lengthy on the palate, a rich expression of strawberry, high-toned citrus and anise. Playing supporting roles are earth and forest floor."
Tedeschi Family,Merlot,83.0,26.0,1,"What a wine. It tries to intimidate. At first, by its bottle size and alcohol level, but in the glass this 100% Garnacha is like a purring kitten—well a purring 20-pound Maine Coon cat, joyous in its pretty red fruit, and its earthy, meaty, vanilla and cinnamon toast range of goodness. All lush, Twisted Oak's Torcido is, like a retro soap opera, brave and beautiful."
Telaya,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,27.0,2,"A new entry in the Dusted Valley lineup, this offering is co-fermented with Viognier and includes a small amount of Petite Sirah as well. It shows real depth and power, a concentrated explosion of boysenberry and black cherry fruit, annotated with clove and anise. A delicious underpinning of mineral and graphite anchor the lengthy finish."
Telaya,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,35.0,1,"Three quarters Sauvignon Blanc and the remaining Sémillon, this young and fresh wine has vivid citrus and grapefruit flavors leaning toward a hint of fresh cut pear. This is clean, crisp and leesy, with bracing acidity."
Telaya,Malbec,84.0,36.0,1,"Aged in equal parts new and neutral French oak along with stainless steel—the latter with no malolactic fermentation—this wine brings out notes of toast, straw and citrus. It has a thick mouth-feel while alternately delivering good concentration and length. It has a thick somewhat ponderous, lemony feel while alternately delivering good concentration and length. It doesn't quite feel entirely like Chardonnay but it's quite delicious."
Telaya,Red Blend,88.5,30.0,2,"Take a blend of five Bordeaux grapes, toss in some Syrah, and voilà—you have your 2011 Bramble Bump Red. Smooth and silky, loaded with purple fruits set against a backdrop of licorice and dark chocolate, this delicious wine finishes with a burst of coffee."
Telaya,White Blend,88.0,23.0,1,"The regular Brut bottling is the star of the new Michelle lineup (formerly Domaine Ste. Michelle). Yeasty and foamy when first poured, it settles into a light and pleasing sparkler, with gentle hints of lemon curd and fresh cream."
Tempus Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,40.0,1,"This is a creamy, tasty, delicious wine, showing a rich mix of vanilla, lemon curd, peach and melon flavors. It coats the tongue generously and has an appealing purity."
Tempus Cellars,Cabernet Franc,89.0,34.0,1,"Woody, wet herbs of oregano and thyme mix with bitter chocolate, a whiff of smoke and extract cranberry and blueberry on the nose of this winery's top-end bottling. Dark flavors of black cherries, blueberries and pencil lead show on the highly structured palate."
Tempus Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.67,33.33,3,"Fruit from six vineyards that comprise the winery's vineyard-designate series is blended into this village cuvée. At first it seems stiff, almost severe, remaining tightly wound for hours. Gradually the fruit emerges, with rhubarb, cranberry and raspberry notes, and highlights of citrus rind in a high-acid finish."
Tempus Cellars,Grenache,88.0,28.0,1,"A pale-colored rosé made entirely from Pinot Noir, this skates near off-dry territory, with perceptible sweetness. It's fruity, soft and round, with forward flavors of cherries and cream."
Tempus Cellars,Merlot,88.0,28.0,1,"This is a svelte but muscular wine with a deep red color, abundant black cherry and plum flavors and a rich, velvety texture. Lively acidity keeps all that ripeness in balance. It's full bodied, substantial in fruit flavor and will be great to pair with big proteins."
Tempus Cellars,Riesling,88.83,17.33,6,"Pun alert. Matchless might suggest a peerless wine, but then you notice that the label has been burnt, as if in a fire. The blend is roughly two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one third Syrah, and the wine is broadly fruity in the Walla Walla style, with suggestions of cherry pie and berry jam. The finish has a rather chalky feel, with chewy tannins."
Tendril,Pinot Noir,92.0,58.4,5,"The weather-wracked vintage of 2011 affected this sometimes stunning bottling, presenting bell pepper greenness with a hint of black earth. It's thin on the palate, which leans toward the greener side of the Cab spectrum, but remains very drinkable with cherry cola and mocha flavors."
Tenet,Syrah,91.67,25.0,3,"Plenty of oak right out in front gives it a bountiful bouquet of smoke, toast, charcoal, etc. Underneath waits a nice core of black-cherry and cassis fruit, balanced with decent acids, but overall the wine seems lightweight for a reserve. It’s definitely ready to drink right now."
Tenor,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.75,77.25,4,"Ripe fruit, augmented with a little earthiness, some barnyard scents, and then layers of dark spice and smoke."
Tensley,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,34.0,1,"Deep purple, it explodes into lush fruit flavors of tangy boysenberry, blackberry, black cherry and cassis, with a smoky black licorice streak woven through. The tannin management is exceptional here––firm and substantial, without any bitter or green aspect. This is a supple, powerful and ageworthy wine with depth and muscle unusual in this price range."
Tensley,Syrah,93.17,60.17,6,"Fermented with wild yeast in neutral French oak barrels, this Evergreen Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc opens with a burst of peppery citrus fruit, almost Grüner-like. That spicy note persists throughout the long, sweetly herbal flavor set, blending lemon and lime, pineapple and grapefruit in a harmonious, lively and palate-cleansing crescendo."
Tercero,Cabernet Franc,89.0,35.0,1,"Sourced from Mike Sauer's Les Vignes de Marcoux Vineyard (near Red Willow), this sends up classic Yakima Valley Syrah scents––black tea, seaside funk, and umami, with drying tannins that seem soaked in ripe black cherry fruit. Juicy finish, with a streak of lemony acidity."
Tercero,Marsanne,88.0,30.0,1,"This is an outlier in the Brian Carter lineup of Euro-style blends, a single vineyard, pure varietal Cabernet. As such, it drills down deeply into the character of Washington terroir as captured in a Cab-friendly site, the Stone Tree Vineyard in the heart of the Wahluke Slope AVA. Dark, deep, concentrated, smoky, with tendrils of earth and rock reaching all the way through the tart and tannic finish."
Tercero,Mourvèdre,90.0,30.0,1,"Multiple vineyards contribute to this standout blend. It feels open and accessible, yet carries the structure to age gracefully. You'll find interesting threads of freshly picked herb, lemon oil, pimiento and olive supporting citrus and fresh apple fruit."
Tercero,Rhône-style White Blend,91.0,30.0,1,"This blend of 35% Chardonnay, 35% Pinot Blanc and 30% Pinot Gris from La Encantada Vineyard is a stunner, starting with its crystalline brilliance in the glass. Lime blossom, pomelo, baking soda and lanolin aromas lead into a grippy palate of green apple, chalk and wet cement. Extremely tense and compelling."
Tercero,Viognier,90.0,30.0,1,"Earthy with dusty loam and forest scents, this wine is intensely rich, with grippy, chewy tannins. Fine-grained oak notes support dark chocolate, clove and tobacco flavors, accented with fruit-forward elements that recall wild blueberry and blackberry. Structured to age, it will be best from 2023 through 2030."
Terlato,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.44,51.33,9,"Sourced from the producer's Stanly Ranch Estate Vineyard and Hyde Vineyard, both in Carneros, this is a stunning effort. Its baked pear fruit provides hefty body and texture, while honeysuckle and apple blossom notes and a squeeze of lemon-like acidity keep it balanced and fresh."
Terlato,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,78.0,2,"Another beauty from this producer and this appellation, Hughes is about granite-like minerality and rocky dust—a big-boned powerhouse from a powerful vintage that boasts generous spiced plum, cola, clove and black pepper flavors."
Terlato,Red Blend,91.0,85.0,1,"This cuvée, says winemaker Josh Bergström, is crafted to compete with village Burgundies. Principally Temperance Hill fruit, it more than does the job, with great mouthfeel, and a succulent tangy ripe mix of citrus and stone fruits. There's a lick of caramel apple coming through also, and the wine is bursting with bright flavors across the board."
Tero Estates,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.67,42.67,3,"Unusual aromatics conjure ruby red grapefruit, Douglas fir needles, green tea and a touch of cola. The site, which is rather cool, fills in the main palate with grapes offering sleek subtle flavors of mountain berry."
Tero Estates,Merlot,94.0,39.0,1,"This herb-laced wine comes from a 1,100-feet elevation outpost five miles from the ocean and shows both feral notes and robust fruit. Tart cranberry flavor dominates, complemented by orange peel nuances. Its tannins are in full force, calling for more time in the glass if not in the cellar. Best the second day after opening, if one can wait."
Tero Estates,Red Blend,88.0,24.0,1,"From an aptly named vineyard, this whopper of a wine blends 37% Zinfandel, 32% Syrah, 16% Grenache and 15% Mourvèdre with 24% new oak and 20% whole-cluster fermentation. The result is a perfume that's both tart with boysenberry and rich with caramel, oak and cola. Black plum, gravel and bay leaf flavors surround its meaty core, persisting deep into the finish."
Terra Bella,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,85.0,1,"Bright, firmly structured and full of classic berry and savory flavors, this wine is rich but balanced and ready to serve with a steak, chop or rack for a special occasion. It has ripe fruit bolstered by firm acidity and a healthy coating of fine-grained, grippy tannins. Best after 2020."
Terra Bella,Syrah,91.0,45.0,1,"Grown against all odds (and against all likelihood of economic viability) overlooking the Pacific Ocean atop Catalina Island, this Chardonnay is a success every vintage. It shows a broad spectrum of nutty aromas, from macadamia to cashew, with touches of honey and daffodil. On the palate, expect walnut, vanilla and oak smoke, with a butterscotch-like finish."
Terra Valentine,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,90.0,1,"Vinified by the former Margerum winemaker (who now works for Morgan Winery), this bottling from one of the appellation's most exciting vineyards is chock-full of baked red cherry, vanilla, clove and gravel aromas. Though light and bright in body, the palate packs intriguing flavors, from raspberry and rose petal to dried fennel and dill."
Terra Valentine,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.67,71.0,3,"From dry-farmed estate vines, this savory, classically styled red offers nuances of cedar, dried herb and peppercorn. It's aromatically reminiscent of the forest that surrounds the estate, delivering a balanced landscape of subtle, elegant flavor and length."
Terra Valentine,Red Blend,85.5,72.5,2,"This combines 95% Pinot Noir with 4% Chardonnay and 1% Pinot Meunier in a just slightly sweet, rounded taste of fresh berries and lush, somewhat piquant acidity."
Terra Valentine,Sangiovese-Syrah,87.0,50.0,1,"A sense of richness comes with the creamy flavors in this smooth, light-bodied Chardonnay-like bubbly. The wine starts with a surprising marshmallow aroma, then goes to pear and ripe apple flavors. It is balanced toward the soft, rather than crisp, side of the scale."
Terra d'Oro,Red Blend,90.0,35.0,2,"An appealing wine with notes of mineral, red apple and tropical fruit. It's dry, fresh and fleshy with tart acidity and a warm finish."
Terra d'Oro,White Blend,90.0,16.0,1,"This sparkling mix of two-thirds Pinot Noir and one-third Chardonnay is a pretty peach color. Voluptuous on the palate, it features flavors of peach and rhubarb that exotically intermingle along a tingling touch of sweetness."
Terra d'Oro,Zinfandel,90.38,30.62,8,"McKinley Springs vineyard sourced this outstanding blend of Cabernet Franc (45%), Cabernet Sauvignon (36%) and Merlot (19%). A complex and inviting, dusty bouquet of herb, olive and tart fruits introduces a wine with smooth moves and subtle details. A perfect mix of Washington fruit with a Bordeaux grip."
Terre Rouge,G-S-M,90.0,30.0,2,"Kudos to Ste. Michelle for accurately labeling this wine, and also for the Riesling sweetness scale on the back of all their Rieslings. Firm Yakima Valley fruit is the backbone here, tart and spicy, with bright flavors of pear and apple. A juicy, palate-cleansing style."
Terre Rouge,Muscat,93.0,15.0,1,"Broadly fruity at first, this turns a little loose-knit, like a Grateful Dead jam. It's compelling but not terribly tight; it meanders into leaf and tea, then chocolate, then back to the light and pretty red fruits."
Terre Rouge,Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains,87.0,20.0,1,"Off-dry and stainless steel fermented, it carries some volatile scents in the nose. Bubble gum and candied orange flavors quickly turn bitter as the wine flattens out in the mouth."
Terre Rouge,Red Blend,89.25,22.5,4,"A floral nose greets you at first sniff, followed by hints of light citrus. A mix of grapefruit, melon and apple flavors are light and enticing, keeping the wine delicate and balanced. The finish leaves an impression of lemon tea."
Terre Rouge,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.2,23.6,5,"Rahn has blended 50% Grenache and 50% Mourvedre and aged it in French oak for a year. The result is a smooth, soft, rich texture, with a mix of cherry and vanilla flavors. A parting shot of dark chocolate marks the finish."
Terre Rouge,Rhône-style White Blend,88.67,25.0,3,"This is 58% Viognier and 42% Chardonnay, making a crisp, clean, dynamic white with plenty of lime and citrus flavor. Delicious and refreshing, it's a perfect food wine."
Terre Rouge,Rosé,92.0,20.0,2,"This tangy wine is laced with plenty of toasty new oak, giving it scents and flavors of cocoa and spice. Some excellent fruit is there, tasting of tart black cherries, but it seems a bit overwhelmed. —P.G."
Terre Rouge,Roussanne,89.29,26.43,7,"Tagaris makes two Rieslings, priced just a buck apart. The “Reserve” may be just a stitch tighter, with more creaminess in the mouth, less in-your-face fruit."
Terre Rouge,Syrah,91.46,43.71,35,"Delicate and pale, this elegant rosé hints at rhubarb and strawberry, dappled with light herbs. Tart and refreshing."
Terre Rouge,White Blend,91.75,25.0,4,"The Attaché brings appealing and lively cherry fruit, framed with citrusy acidity. The power in this wine is all forward and fruit-driven. It's quite good, but more for immediate drinking than cellaring."
Territorial,Chardonnay,91.0,44.0,2,"A field blend of Grenache Blanc, Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier, this delightfully floral wine exudes spring flowers and fresh, just-ripe peach. The wine is dry, although the finish has a subtle suggestion of honey. A delicious wine for spring and summer sipping."
Territorial,Riesling,92.0,18.0,1,"The winery's top cuvée is notable for its perfume of rose petals with a subtle whiff of body talc. Balanced and feminine, this soft and graceful wine glides across the palate with flavor highlights of cherries and plums. Drink now while it's at its best."
Tertulia,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.57,30.57,7,"Note the remarkably low alcohol! Not surprisingly, this is a searingly tart wine, the acidity further emphasized by stainless steel fermentation and aging. Nonetheless, flavors are rich and deep, a lemon and grapefruit explosion that seems to demand raw oysters. Definitely a wine for acid lovers."
Tertulia,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,45.0,1,"Rollat is the mid-level red wine of the three inaugural releases from Chateau Rollat. It's less brooding and compact than the companion Edouard Cabernet. Immediately accessible, it could almost be the template for this new and exciting producer; elegant, polished and supple with ripe sweet fruit and fine tannins. Flavors of black cherry and cassis envelop the palate, gently spreading out into a full-on fruit rainbow."
Tertulia,Carmenère,87.0,39.0,5,"Less immediately accessible than the 2005, the 2006 is tight and tart and almost seems encased in some sort of a shell. The fruit is concentrated raspberry and plum, and the acids taste natural while the tannins are polished and proportionate. The wine stays focused and strong through a very long finish that dapples in toasted coconut and chocolate malt. If you are a Rollat collector (and you should be) this would be the wine to cellar for five or six years, waiting for the Edouard to come into full flower."
Tertulia,G-S-M,91.0,55.0,1,"A great effort, with mountain-grown fruit, high-altitude acids that give the flavors shape and cut, tightening up and brightening up the sharp, wild berry fruit. Iron filings and stone add a strong mineral element as well; this is the best yet from Dumas Station."
Tertulia,Grenache,89.5,30.0,2,"Make no mistake—the model for this wine can be found among the classified growth white wines of Bordeaux. The barrel influences are many and varied, layering in a mix of smoke, caramel and cracker; and the fruit is supple and beautifully blended. White raisins, Asian pears, pineapple and peaches blend together gracefully, and the alcohol remains at a moderate 13.8%."
Tertulia,Marsanne,87.0,20.0,1,"This is the first release from Cadence's estate vineyard, a 94/6 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Sharp and intense, the nose brings out tightly wound red fruit scents, annotated with leaf and white pepper. In this inaugural vintage the Cabernet Sauvignon clearly dominates. A supple, muscular, focused wine with the structure to develop nicely for up to a decade."
Tertulia,Merlot,86.0,30.0,2,"South Coast's winemaker used 100% Syrah from the 2010 vintage to make this fun, red sparkler, which was once upon a time known as Cold Duck. It takes advantage of Syrah's big, bold berry flavors, while smelling intensely sweet, like a Jamba Juice smoothie. Very foamy on opening; let it settle and drink it supercold."
Tertulia,Red Blend,88.0,45.0,1,"This dark, concentrated wine is jammy in red and black fruit, with a doughy hint of biscuits. On the heavier side, it is structured with a hit of acidity on the dry, tannic finish. A sizable wine, it will require sizable pairings to tame its strength."
Tertulia,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,55.0,1,"This wine is straight down the Cabernet fairway with aromas and flavors of black and green olive, plum, herbs, mocha and pencil lead. It's soft in feel with a pinch of sugar stitching it all together."
Tertulia,Rosé,88.0,22.0,1,"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Zinfandel shows aromas of green olive, lemongrass, herb and woodspice. The style is elegant with sweet fruit flavors backed by lightly astringent tannins."
Tertulia,Syrah,89.67,32.67,6,"Steely at first sip, and then oaky and midweight, this white reflects the vintage and the region, providing ripe creaminess and plenty of oomph. Made in a heavier style, it remains well-balanced in acidity, with a lengthy, tropical finish."
Tertulia,Tempranillo,86.0,35.0,1,"From 86% Syrah and 14% Zinfandel grapes, this is a dark wine, burgundy-orange in color and equally dense at first on the palate. It picks up freshness as it opens, disrobing flavors of wild strawberry and grapefruit, along with an intensity of blackberry. Bright, it finishes dry."
Tertulia,Viognier,87.67,20.33,3,"Peppery, rich and low in pronounced oak, this estate-driven Cab has softened tannins and is most definitely drinkable now, with pungent, bright fruit and a lengthy, leathery finish."
Tessier Winery,Pinot Noir,90.14,41.29,7,All of the fruit for this wine comes from Clifton Hill Vineyard. Aromas seem a bit green and woody while the high-octane flavors are rich but don't have the structure to stand them up.
Tessier Winery,Viognier,90.0,32.0,1,"Reserved aromas of Rainier cherry, strawberry preserves, herbs and fig lead to plump, silky fruit flavors. It's a very pretty representation of the vintage."
Testarossa,Chardonnay,91.27,46.78,37,"Soft and supple in lemon and melon, this 100% varietal white was given time in both stainless steel and neutral oak, the combination rewarding in a rounded, approachable mouthfeel that's both creamy and ripe. Stone fruit makes an appearance, before the wine finishes lean and tart."
Testarossa,Pinot Noir,91.19,63.45,62,"Made by David Low of Anthill Farms in extremely small quantities, this is a new brand devoted to light-bodied wines from fine, cool-climate sites. Tight in dried cranberry and cherry, this is indeed a light and subtle undertaking, dusty and perfumed in rosewater fragrance."
Testarossa,Red Blend,87.0,35.0,1,"Pinot Noir from Carneros forms the basis of this dry rosé that has seen no time in oak. Dark red-orange in color, it's a fresh, zingy take on raspberry and strawberry goodness, never cloying or annoying, that finishes in a burst of grapefruit."
Testarossa,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,25.0,1,"A rare find, this is a delightfully fun wine, black and inky. Exuberant red cherry and brioche play off one another on the nose and palate. Integrated tannins give it a softness, though it is in no way shy or lacking in power."
Textbook,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.0,65.0,1,"Aromas of raspberry and baking spices are followed by tart, full-bodied fruit flavors backed by cranberry-like tartness. It shows a lovely sense of texture but the alcohol distracts."
Textbook,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,65.0,2,"Made with 75% Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this wine brings aromas of café au lait, toast and red fruit. It's full bodied, with coffee and cherry flavors that linger."
The Bridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.33,100.0,3,"Made from Moscato di Canelli, this dessert wine is more like a still wine in bouquet, not exuding sweet as much as floral. On the palate, it's a different story, taking on richness and thickness around flavors of baked apple and nutmeg, finding a good balance on the finish."
The Calling,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,62.0,1,"There is a very juicy nose to this bottling, with dark plum, berry and the slightest hint of baking spice. Red cherry and cranberry flavors pop on the palate, alongside decent helping of clove-like spice, but it's the stony grip that takes this one to the next level."
The Calling,Chardonnay,89.83,41.17,6,"Gravelly aromas of wet slate meet with dark cranberry and baked red cherry on the nose of this bottling, which the Duckhorn crew sources from this historic vineyard. The palate is relatively light with very earthy flavors, showing tangy red fruit, thyme and wet soil flavors."
The Calling,Pinot Noir,91.67,62.0,3,"This is not labeled as such, but it's Petite Sirah. The fruit is young, plummy, with purple-berry flavors in abundance. It drops off in the midpalate, but returns in a ripe but not too potent finish. Tannins are proportionate. All in all, this is your optimal pizza wine."
The Counselor,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,35.0,1,"Inviting in succulent, brambly berry, this is a balanced wine that takes a light approach to ripeness. Clove and vanilla add to its admirable length and breadth."
The Crusher,Chardonnay,83.0,13.0,1,"Dark red cherry and raspberry blend with the slightest hints of thyme and slate on the nose of this bottling, which is made in a urban facility in the coastal city of Marina. There is a tangy cran-raspberry element to the sip, enhanced by licorice spice."
The Crusher,Petite Sirah,90.0,15.0,1,"Soft and pretty, this marries light spice to fruit flavors of apple and strawberry. Think blanc de noir without the sparkle and you're on the right trail. It's got substantial palate weight and a fairly thick mouthfeel."
The Crusher,Red Blend,85.0,18.0,1,"Bright aromas of orange blossom, night jasmine and gardenia are juxtaposed by a more mineral-driven backbone of wet cement. It's fairly light on its feet, with touches of sweetness, but more sprightly in tone, with fresh acidity and grippy texture taking it far beyond your grandma's Orange Muscat."
The Dancing Fox,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,59.0,1,"This is a rare 100% varietal, single vineyard example of this grape. Light in color, it brings aromas of gun smoke, herb and cherry, showing some reduction. The flavors are light and elegant, displaying a lot of delicacy."
The Dancing Fox,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,26.0,2,"Peppery herbs lead the nose on this bottling, with sagebrush, bay leaf and rust giving depth to the light cranberry and raspberry fruit. The palate is earthy with juniper and turned-loam flavors, plus more bay leaf, iron cranberry and some rhubarb."
The Dancing Fox,Zinfandel,88.0,27.0,1,"This bottling offers gingerbread cake, baked blueberry and smoked pork on the nose. It's soft on the palate, with finely polished tannins imparting a plush texture. Black plum, strawberry and a touch of mint mark the palate. The structure shows itself just enough on the finish."
The Decision,Pinot Noir,90.0,80.0,2,"The winery's signature sparkler, this blend of equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, with touches of Pinot Gris and Pinot Meunier, dazzles in rounded oak and a soft texture marked by grapefruit zest and fresh nectarine. Crisp and vibrant, it becomes richer on the finish, showing a spark of honey-baked brioche."
The Divining Rod,Red Blend,85.5,13.0,2,"From the Pratt Vineyard on Sexton Road, this impressive offering is bold and lush, smoothly textured even in its concentration of thick red cherry and forest. It exalts in a shock of white pepper that is beautiful to behold."
The Eyrie Vineyards,Chardonnay,93.2,42.5,10,"Toasty oak kicks off the nose of this bottling, and then come touches of vanilla, lemon cookie, flint, buttered toast and almost marshmallow. Flavors are quite smoky, with roasted almond and sea salt, but the grippy texture is the most intriguing part."
The Eyrie Vineyards,Pinot Gris,93.0,34.25,4,"Grenache makes up 60% of this wine with Syrah (30%) and Mourvèdre rounding it out. Light aromas of exotic barrel spice, herb and dark fruit are followed by rich lusciously textured cherry flavors that coat the palate from end to end. One wants a bit more aromatically but the palate more than makes up the difference."
The Eyrie Vineyards,Pinot Noir,92.81,63.88,16,"This wine is a blend of Mourvèdre (63%), Grenache (27%) and Syrah. The aromas pop, with notes of freshly ground black pepper, black fruit and herb. The palate is action packed with juicy dark-fruit flavors that stretch out on the finish."
The Farm Winery,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,65.0,1,"Black cherry, licorice, loamy soil and a touch of roasted beef show on the nose of this bottling from a beautiful estate in the eastern Santa Ynez Valley. Black cherry, dried dill and fennel, coffee bean and slightly bitter dark chocolate come across on the palate that is still quite young with sticky tannins, though very easy to sip already."
The Farm Winery,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,81.67,3,"This full and smoothly soft wine blended with 10% Petite Sirah, 7% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot is aged in American oak, a quarter of it new. It pleases in bright red currant, cassis and wisps of blackberry, both approachable and sophisticated. Velvety black licorice meets smoky campfire on the finish."
The Farm Winery,Grenache,91.0,60.0,1,"An herbal undertone lurks beneath richer, layered concentrations of big tannin and toasty oak in this 100% varietal wine. Meaty and bold, it highlights the variety's ability to be extracted, fruity and nuanced in dried herb, cedar, graphite and sage."
The Farm Winery,Red Blend,89.33,75.0,3,"Dark-gold color makes way for a tension of Meyer lemon, grapefruit and tart apple, unexpectedly fresh flavors given the hue and concentration of this wine. A creaminess on the palate is lush and round yet able to find companionship in a wealth of juicy acidity."
The Farm Winery,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.5,60.0,2,"Light but juicy aromas of white grapes, sandalwood and cinnamon show on the nose of this bottling by Irvine-raised, Cal Poly-educated, Paso Robles-residing Ryan Render. There is a flinty touch to the palate, with rounded green pear, baked apple and nectarine fruit, though the savory sea-salt touch is what makes this wine shine."
The Farm Winery,Syrah-Grenache,91.0,60.0,1,"Golden-honey colored, this wine has toasty toffee oak and full-bodied richness, with a stark layering of citrus and baked apple. Concentrated and thick, it shows its youth and should benefit with time in both the glass and in the bottle."
The Federalist,Red Blend,88.0,33.0,3,"Full bodied and fully concentrated, this estate-grown wine showcases black tar, licorice and black cherry, well-developed flavors that ride a luxurious texture of grippy tannin and toasty oak. Dark as night, the flavors are protracted and extensive through the finish."
The Federalist,Zinfandel,87.0,29.0,1,"Four vineyards – Ribbon Ridge, Momtazi, Maresh and Shea – are included here. Soft and seductive, this wine caresses the palate with silky fruit. Aromatically it weaves together red fruits, truffles and clean, earthy scents. It reaches just over 13% alcohol; truly Burgundian yet with an Oregon flair to the fruit flavors. It puts the lie to any notion that this was a poor vintage. Challenging to be sure, but great wines were made in 2007, and this is one of them."
The Four Graces,Pinot Noir,89.8,62.4,5,"Very consistent in style with previous vintages, this textural, lemony, racy Riesling seems bone dry, though it is noted as having 1% residual sugar. Along with rich flavors of grapefruit and citrus, there are nectarine and pear fruit highlights and a sharp minerality."
The Girls in the Vineyard,White Blend,89.5,19.0,2,"Reserved in aromas at first, this shows charred wood, red cherries, pomegranate and graphite on the nose. Quite intriguing texturally, the palate is sticky with tannins but light in body, offering flavors of cola and tart cranberry."
The Great Oregon Wine Company,Pinot Gris,83.0,11.0,1,Aromas of bright pink roses and soft cherry fruit are a bit shy on the nose but pretty when they do arise. The palate of this 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier blend shows raspberry fruit and lime-rind tartness.
The Grifter,Red Blend,85.0,25.0,1,"Though this bottling saw no malolactic fermentation or oak, the aromas are well rounded, with smoked lemon and kiwi notes. The palate offers lemon curd and apple-sauce flavors, with hints of smokiness, even without the oak."
The Illegitimate,Red Blend,87.0,25.0,1,"This wine starts out strongly reduced, making it a challenge to get at the pink grapefruit, lychee and spice aromas. The flavors drink just off dry, with high wire acidity. There are good things going on but the reduction is a challenge to overcome."
The Messenger,Red Blend,87.0,18.0,1,"The aromas start out quite locked up, with notes of purple fruit and flowers. The palate reveals fresh, quite pure aromas, with well-balanced acid and tannins and a finish that lingers."
The Naked Grape,Red Blend,86.0,18.0,1,"Another strong entry in the emergent Cab-meets-Syrah category, this 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Syrah blend offers aromas of black plum, boysenberry, dried purple flowers and strong anise. The flavors are compelling, with baked boysenberry, strawberry and plum notes leading into roasted fennel bulbs and balsamic vinegar."
The Smuggler's Son,Red Blend,92.0,35.0,1,"Aromas of white pepper, dried herb, flowers and dark fruit lead to a full-bodied palate, loaded with dark-cherry flavors. The tannins provide some grip."
The Tribe,Chardonnay,92.0,32.0,1,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (74%), with the balance equally split between Syrah and Merlot. Jammy aromas of spice, clove, blackberry and black currant are followed by full-bodied dark-fruit flavors that bring an irresistible sense of deliciousness."
The Tribe,Red Blend,92.5,38.0,2,"This is a Pinot-based refresher with substantial body, dry and tart with streaks of cranberry and raspberry. The stand-out character comes from its savory element of spice and sea spray, in addition to the weightiness that makes it welcome with food."
The Vineyard House,Chardonnay,94.0,75.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Art Den Hoed Petite Sirah (80%) and Gunkel Vineyard Zinfandel. Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, raspberry and purple fruit are followed by full-bodied palate-coating fruit flavors, brightened by fresh acidity. The interest is as much about feel as flavor."
The Walls,Chardonnay,89.0,36.0,1,"This wine is a unique blend of Malbec (60%), Syrah (20%), Merlot (15%) and Petit Verdot. It opens with brooding but alluring aromas of dark plum, asphalt, and a kiss of baking spice. The flavors are full bodied and palate coating, showing weight but also a sense of suppleness that charms the senses."
The Walls,Grenache Blanc,89.0,38.0,1,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of cranberry and dark fruit sprinkled with baking spices. The palate is rich and flavorful, packing a wallop of cherry flavors."
The Walls,Red Blend,90.0,38.0,1,"This is a beautiful botrytised wine, made from a field blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling and Gewürztraminer. Light on its feet and reined-in in terms of sweetness, it's golden hay-colored and has a touch of reduction, allowing the Riesling nose to dominate. Decadent yet restrained, it's also lengthy and complex, with highlights of orange and pear."
The Walls,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.0,46.0,2,"This full-bodied wine offers a depth of brambly blackberry, smoky clove and cigar box that make it compelling and inviting on the velvety-smooth palate, well integrated in oak and tannin. The finish is a touch spicy, bringing out more of the clove and a shake of black pepper."
The Walls,Rosé,90.0,22.0,2,"This opens with a pleasing toasty aroma, following through on the palate. That deft touch of French oak (33% new) frames a solid core of strawberry preserves and Bing cherry fruit. It resonates on through a stylish, textural finish. Enjoy this immediately, and tuck away a few bottles to drink in five years."
The Walls,Tempranillo,86.0,42.0,1,"From the Elyse Winery family, this blends a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Carmenere, all from a vineyard next door to its winery that it planted to these varieties. An intrigue of orange blossom and jasmine leads to soft, velvety waves of black currant, savory dried herb and juicy acidity."
The Winemaker's Loft,Red Blend,90.0,13.0,1,"Organically grown grapes are vinified in all stainless steel, resulting in this fresh, delightfully textural wine. Lime, pineapple and lemon verbena flavors are backed with refreshing minerality. It's clean and crisply delicious."
The Winery SF,Red Blend,85.0,18.0,1,"Here is a vivid, racy, puckering and precise take on Oregon Chardonnay. With its lovely mix of green and yellow fruits—apple, melon and citrus—it strikes a refreshing chord across the entire palate."
The Winery SF,Sparkling Blend,84.0,20.0,1,"An exciting varietal wine from an appellation that has done well by it, this opens in aromas of baked bread and compost, in addition to toasty bacon and chocolate. Tart and tight, it's ripe and yet restrained, a nice tension of contrast at its core."
The Winery SF,White Blend,85.0,16.0,1,"Earthy scents project leafy greens, beetroot and forest floor, but in the mouth the wine opens up with robust black cherry, coffee and cassis. It's complex and detailed, though it retains that inherent earthiness through the finish."
The Withers Winery,Chardonnay,91.0,36.0,2,"If you've ever had a Momtazi wine, you know that there is a strong earthy aspect to the flavors that sets the vineyard apart from most others. In the scents and tastes here you'll find composted earth, chalk, dried leaves and black tea ahead of black cherry fruit, but those funk-soaked flavors add up to a complex and intriguing wine."
The Withers Winery,Pinot Noir,89.0,44.67,6,"Plump aromas of lemon butter, gardenia and hot sourdough toast with tangerine marmalade show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is pillowy in texture, offering ripe flavors of peach custard, sea salt, butterscotch, tangy grapefruit and mandarin slices."
The Withers Winery,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.67,36.67,3,"Mellow and pleasant aromas of nectarine, Bosc pear and Meyer lemon pith make for a very classically restrained Chardonnay on this bottling. There is solid zip to the sip, where high-toned and tightly wound flavors of citrus, honeysuckle and poached pear show."
Theopolis,Petite Sirah,93.0,38.0,1,"Green plum, mowed lawn, pungent green apple skins and a touch of candied peach ripeness make for a classic Sauv Blanc nose on this bottling from one of the region's oldest producers. The palate is zippy with persistent and penetrating acidity, showing tight green apple and well as riper pineapple flavors, with a flash of vanilla toward the finish."
Theopolis,White Blend,90.0,22.0,1,"This 100% varietal wine is brawny and blustery in style: big boned with a lot of heat. Sturdy tannins surround extracted black fruit and shards of cinnamon, with fresh tobacco taking root on the finish."
Thistle,Pinot Noir,89.33,40.0,3,"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, aromas of herb, red fruit, flower and spice are at the fore. The palate is full with red and black-fruit flavors with a lightly tacky feel."
Thomas Fogarty,Chardonnay,91.89,63.89,9,"Black cherries, cola, fennel and dill come together for a thick aromatic profile on this blend of Grenache, Syrah and Carignane. Pencil lead, blackberry preserves and black pepper show on the palate, which is rich but not particularly fruity, thanks to beef char and woody flavors."
Thomas Fogarty,Pinot Noir,92.88,63.12,8,"Strawberry and red currant complement deeper, more savory aspects of cedar and gun smoke in this thick, full-bodied and concentrated reserve-level wine, accented in bitter, black tea."
Thomas George,Chardonnay,88.5,37.75,8,"Juicy strawberry jam and dried herb combine for a forceful attack of bold, concentrated flavor and robust body, the wine textured in dusty tannin."
Thomas George,Pinot Noir,89.17,59.5,6,"Cherry-vanilla and cola provide a voluptuous, full-bodied outline for this estate-grown wine, given 20 months in French oak, one-quarter of it new."
Thomas O'Neil Cellars,Chardonnay,87.0,20.0,1,"This blend of Chardonnay (44%), Viognier (39%) and Roussanne (17%) has surprisingly light aromas of melon, peach and straw leading to full-feeling, tingly stone-fruit flavors. It wants more aromatically but the palate delivers the enjoyment."
Thomas O'Neil Cellars,Merlot,88.0,26.0,1,"This blend is principally Cabernet Sauvignon (48%), Cabernet Franc (23%) and Merlot (20%), with the balance Petit Verdot and Malbec. Appealing aromas of toast, barrel spice, vanilla, black cherry and herb lead to tart red- and black-fruit flavors that flow down the middle of the palate, with lightly grainy tannins supporting them."
Thomas O'Neil Cellars,Riesling,87.0,20.0,1,"Gushing with bright strawberry and raspberry aromas and flavors, this wine tastes fresh and delicious, lively and fun. It's dry, well balanced, moderately tannic, and has an appetizing, grippy texture."
Thorny Rose,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,11.0,1,"From the site made famous by Merry Edwards along the appellation's Laguna Ridge, this wine envelops dark cherry, strawberry and herb flavors along a brooding, softly velvet and voluptuously body, weighted slightly in toasted oak and firm tannin."
Thralls,Pinot Noir,92.0,45.0,1,"Light and fresh on the nose, this twist-top bottling shows hibiscus, strawberry, chipped slate, a touch of clove and crushed star anise on the nose. The palate shows more slate as well as ripe raspberry, cinnamon and sagebrush."
Three,Red Blend,89.5,28.0,2,"This medium-bodied, affordably priced wine offers a wealth of juicy red fruit with soft layers of tannin. It was aged in unobtrusive oak, 25% of it new."
Three,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,48.0,1,"This is produced only in the best vintages; here from just two barrels the winery noted as standouts. Concentrated flavors of cherry and cassis are amplified with a streak of red licorice. Acids keep the wine poised and fresh, and the finish brings in a dollop of chocolate and a hint of cut tobacco."
Three,Rosé,87.0,16.0,1,"Previously lableled Quatre Journaux, this is now vineyard-designated, but otherwise everything remains unchanged. It's a pretty wine, with rhubarb and red-plum fruit. Further details of orange peel and chocolate emerge as it opens. The perfectly balanced acids and tannins suggest it will thrive in the cellar. Drink now–2006."
Three,Zinfandel,92.0,28.86,7,"Robust and brawny, this longtime estate wine offers a combination of red and black berry, rich and succulent as if in a crumble, topped in vanilla and pleasing sprinkles of nutmeg and cardamom. Complex and layered, it delivers in flavor and structure."
Three Fat Guys,Chardonnay,92.0,40.0,1,"This wine has intense and complex flavors while keeping a graceful texture and great balance between acidity, body and tannins. Aromas suggest raspberries and strawberries with hints of pine forest and earth, while the flavors are vivid and bright."
Three Pines,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,15.0,2,"From a relatively cool hillside site within the Oak Knoll District, this wine dances in lemon and green apple, completely crisp atop a fuller-bodied style embraced in oak. Luxurious on the palate, it finishes with a bite of salty brine."
Three Pines,Chardonnay,86.0,14.0,1,"A huge, concentrated wine, this offers all the characteristic ripeness and big flavor in the variety, from brown sugar to baked plum to vanilla to tar. Almost reaching Port-like proportions in terms of alcohol and weight, it pulls back just enough to reveal spicy black pepper and cinnamon on the finish."
Three Pines,Red Blend,87.0,15.0,1,"The Brown Ranch is a relatively warm swath of the appellation, which touches Hyde Vineyard, its neighbor. This wine shows a wealth of toasty oak and black fruit on its robust frame, but opens into softening layers of black tea and blackberry in the glass. Smooth and full bodied, it's a lush, vanilla-kissed wine."
Three Rivers,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,57.5,2,"Intriguing aromas of dried herbs give nuance to the heartier bourbon barrel, cherry candy and caramel aromas on the nose of this bottling of traditional Portuguese varieties Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cão, Tinta Francesca and Tinta Madeira. Caramelized black cherries and blueberries mesh with peppercorns and asphalt on the palate, which is expressive and nuanced for such a powerful style."
Three Rivers,Cabernet Franc,86.75,20.25,4,"This is a consistently good offering and special bottling from the producer. The wine is earthy, stemmy and herbal, with a big tannic backbone built for aging. Pomegranate and cranberry provide a crispness of shy red fruit that opens and softens in the glass. Drink now through 2021."
Three Rivers,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,41.2,5,"Bright, tart fruit conjures up fresh raspberries and cranberries, with potent acids and light hints of metal shavings and dried leaves. A lovely wisp of cinnamon toast elevates the finish."
Three Rivers,Chardonnay,88.0,16.75,4,"The color is light, which is natural for the variety, while aromas are lightly fruity, earthy and tobacco-like. Bright raspberry and cranberry flavors come with cedar and dried-herb accents that add complexity. It's medium bodied, well balanced and light in tannins, with a very appetizing texture."
Three Rivers,Red Blend,87.57,19.43,7,"Take a walk on the wild side with this Rhône-style red. The meaty, spicy, earthy aromas lead to enjoyable fruit, spice and mocha flavors that rest on a firm bed of fine tannins and good acidity."
Three Rivers,Riesling,88.0,15.0,1,"This blend of 51% Syrah, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Grenache shows root beer, smoked black cherries, dark chocolate and sweet tar on the nose. The palate is powered by dried red fruits, more smoke and a dusty character."
Three Rivers,Rosé,85.0,14.0,1,"Pulling from both the Sacrashe and Bergfeld vineyards, as well as other partner sites, this is a tremendously impressive wine, bright in herb, cedar and cassis, with soft, integrated tannins. Concentrated, it maintains elegance despite the full-bodied luxuriousness, finishing in decadent chocolate. Drink now through 2022."
Three Sticks,Chardonnay,93.33,49.33,6,"A tribute to winemaker Steve Leveque, whose name in French means “the bishop,” this is a layered and powerful 100% varietal wine. It's generous in blackberry and black-cherry jam on toast, with a side flavor of coconut macaroon. Drink now through 2022."
Three Sticks,Pinot Noir,92.5,63.75,8,"The kirsch, cranberry, dried herb, pomegranate and barrel spice aromas are laser focused, with smoked meat notes providing accents. The black fruit flavors are über concentrated and dense. It's wound tightly at first but when it opens up, it delivers."
Three of Cups,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,40.0,1,"Woody, herbal and resplendent in forest-floor pine and sandalwood, this is a complex, earthy and medium-bodied wine. It's low in oak, and revelatory in cool-climate seductions of pomegranate, cranberry and rhubarb compote. The finish is all black tea, with still-developing tannin structure and power."
Three of Cups,Red Blend,85.0,28.0,1,"From the hillsides of Westside Road, a goldmine of goodness, this estate-driven wine is packed with cinnamon, black-cherry clafouti and crushed rose petals. Soft and seductively silky on the palate, it's bright and deceptively light, a symphony of pomegranate, cardamon and blood orange that lingers on the finish."
Threesome Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,87.67,3,"High in acidity with a voluptuously sleek and supple body, this is a smoothly tamed wine. It's youthful and structured, with a mix of citrus, black cherry and cola. Medium bodied, it's memorably balanced and possesses subtle power."
Thunder Mountain,Chardonnay,87.0,43.0,1,"Made in tiny amounts, this wine blends 72% Mourvèdre with field-blended Petite Sirah, Syrah, Peloursin, Carignane and Alicante Bouschet. It comes from two acres in the heart of the appellation, representing historic varieties still hanging on for dear life. Raisiny leather, gunpowder and an intensity of blueberry give it life, atop an undeniable funkiness that's hard to resist."
Thurston Wolfe,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.5,50.0,2,"This is a memorable wine, with enticing and complex aromas of gorgeous ripe fruit accented by cedar, tea and forest floor. The palate echos the aromas with vibrant and rich flavors, while the mouthfeel is firm and bolstered by fine-grained tannins."
Thurston Wolfe,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,23.5,2,"The first sniffs of this Vermentino—which Tablas Creek's French vineyard consultant suggested planting because of Paso Robles' rocky limestone soils—recall a hot day at the beach, with ocean spray salinity and hot sand aromas. Once sipped, the beach turns to a refreshing, watered-down orange juice experience, with a hint of lemon-lime on the finish. Pair with any fresh fish."
Thurston Wolfe,Malbec,89.0,25.0,1,"Black-purple in color, this is a deeply brambly and earthy wine, a blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Tempranillo. Intense and showy, it'll please palates that like upfront fruit and a luscious, near-lascivious mouthfeel."
Thurston Wolfe,Petite Sirah,88.25,23.0,4,"This well-aged release definitely falls on the ripe-to-the-point-of-raisins side of the fruit spectrum. It's almost Port-like, with flavors of blackberry pie and coffee. Not a dessert wine though—it's bone dry and ready to drink right now."
Thurston Wolfe,Port,92.0,16.0,1,"The aromas of strawberry, orange peel and plum seem a bit muddled, while the palate brings greater clarity and delineation to the medium bodied, creamy-feeling fruit flavors."
Thurston Wolfe,Red Blend,88.0,17.0,6,"This one-time-only blanc de blancs is made from a Stony Hill Chardonnay clone planted in a single block of the producer's vineyard—since planted to Pinot Noir. This sparkler is sublime, the mousse silky and speckled in minerality. Lemon, pear and brine combine to good effect on the palate, buoying the exuberant fragrances of orange peel and cream pie."
Thurston Wolfe,Syrah,87.0,20.0,1,"Gamy, fascinating aromas of bloody beef, charred lamb chops and dank mushrooms meet with cracked black pepper and asphalt on the nose of this wine from a coastal vineyard near Cambria. Similar sensations show on the palate, including underripe boysenberry, dried lilac, lavender, black pepper, pencil lead and dry-aged meat."
Thurston Wolfe,Touriga Nacional,92.0,16.0,1,"A hearty addition of 19% Malbec and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon contribute to this wine's complexity and soft, round profile of hearty tannin and oak. It offers well-defined flavors of salty leather, plum and dark chocolate."
Thurston Wolfe,Touriga Nacional Blend,93.0,16.0,1,"Aged in 100% new French oak, aromas of roasted coffee bean, herb, char and dark fruit give way to lightly grainy dark-fruit flavors. The wood seems a bit primary at present but it still brings a lot of appeal. Give it some time to integrate."
Thurston Wolfe,White Blend,88.0,13.8,5,"Fermented 40% whole cluster and aged in four-year-old 500L puncheons, bright aromas of fresh asparagus, herb, flower, ember and earth are followed by a blend of fruit and savory flavors. It provides an appealing texture that keeps the interest high."
Thurston Wolfe,Zinfandel,88.12,21.12,8,"This is a strong showing for this growing region south of San Jose, which was historically home to prominent vineyards. Crushed black peppercorns, thyme and rosemary show on the nose against tart blackberry juice, with cola and a touch of blackened beef. Black currant and elderberry arise on the sip along with white-pepper spice, held together by balanced acidity and tannins. It's ripe, but far from overdone."
Tiedemann,Red Blend,85.0,48.5,2,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (58%), Merlot (28%), Syrah (9%) and Malbec. Aromas of macerated cherries, baking spice and cranberry are followed by sweet fruit flavors. It brings a slight sense of astringency but otherwise delivers the goods."
Tierra y Mar,Chardonnay,86.0,25.0,1,"Airy and creamy aromas of sliced pluot, Asian pear, fresh orange rind and a touch of wet bread make for a compelling and zesty bubbly. The sip starts with a citrusy tang, continues with riper flashes of nectarine on the midpalate and shows a yeasty wash throughout. There's serious textural grip to the palate."
Tildio,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,33.0,1,"Oaky toast and salty, firm acidity give this wine a flavor profile of lemon, apple and dried herb that's lengthy and full of complexity. Medium bodied, it finds balance between fruit flavors and a savory edge, remaining bright and rich on the palate."
Tildio,Cabernet Franc,91.0,35.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 73% of this wine, along with 20% Merlot, 5% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc. Tightly wound aromas of wood spice, vanilla, black fruit, plum and coffee bean give way to full-bodied, palate-coating and concentrated cherry and espresso flavors that linger on the finish. The barrel influence is heavy, but it works."
Tildio,Malbec,89.0,35.0,1,"From the Fairbarn Vineyard, this bottling shows fresh-pressed blackberry, violet and lilac aromas, with the slightest wafts of smoke and tar. Although the tannins are quite firm on the sip, this wine is still young and should age well, allowing the bright acidity to continue showing flavors of beef and tart berries in years to come."
Tildio,Red Blend,88.0,28.5,2,"Greg Brewer goes for full restraint on this bottling, which offers extremely tight aromas of citrus and wet rocks, only barely revealing that it's a Chardonnay. The flavors are similarly restrained, with lemongrass and guava barely peeking out. Yet the texture is sublime and tightly wound, lifted by a fresh acidity."
Tildio,Sauvignon Blanc,87.5,22.5,2,"The aromas bring notes of baking spice, vanilla, cassis, coconut and dark fruit, along with a penetrating anise note. The black-fruit flavors are rich and luscious, displaying a sense of hedonism that shows equal parts fruit and barrel."
Tildio,Tempranillo,84.67,30.0,3,"A dainty nose of sliced pears, squeezed lemon and slowly emergent guava characterizes this sparkling wine, made in Santa Barbara from Northern California fruit. The bubbles are quite foamy, disappearing magically on the palate, but not before showing light acidity and a flash of guava."
TimberRock,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,26.0,1,"Coming from the Stone Corral Vineyard, this wine tends toward the browner side of the scent spectrum, with roasted root vegetables, baking spice and a bit of anise. It's dainty on the palate, but strong in flavors of mocha, licorice, ripe raspberry and beet juice, proving brightly acidic and a tad more tannic than similar wines of this vintage."
Timbre,Chardonnay,93.0,36.0,1,"Raspberry and clove characterize the nose on this single-vineyard bottling. The palate kicks off with vibrant black cherry, slips toward black olive on the midpalate and ends with bright acidity on a decent finish."
Timbre,Pinot Noir,93.33,45.0,3,"Pomegranate, sour cherry, cranberry and slight anise emerge with patience on the shy nose. The flavors are also light, with cranberry sauce, brown spices, a touch of pepper and an herbal finish."
Timbre,Viognier,88.0,28.0,1,"The nose offers crushed cinnamon sticks sprinkled upon just-picked raspberries and squeezed plums. The palate brings heavier red fruits, approaching boysenberry and pomegranate juice, with a clove spice throughout."
Timothy Malone,Pinot Noir,89.67,39.67,3,"Top lots from Sheridan, Dineen and Meek vineyard grapes go into this reserve. This is always the most thick and dense of the Stevens wines, and the tannins, though very well managed, are chewy and substantial. They dominate this young wine, but the stacked and subtle layers of red and black fruits, leaf and forest floor materials, moist earth and ashes keep the flavors complex and interesting. This wine absolutely must be decanted, and can be cellared almost indefinitely."
Timothy Malone,Riesling,93.5,20.0,2,"This magnum-sized bottling named after Joey Tensley's niece is a study of darkness, with asphalt, charred beef, black currant and a hint of purple flowers on the nose. It's suave and already elegant on the sip, with stewed blackberries and tart black plums, but it still needs time to grow into its sure-to-be-savory side. Drink 2019–2030."
Tin Barn,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,52.0,1,"This is a consistently delicious wine, fermented in a combination of new and once-used French oak. Fully realized, it has a sublime texture and light body that's balanced by long, lingering acidity. The fresh-fruit flavors show elements of orange, lime, lemon and peach."
Tin Barn,Merlot,86.0,39.0,1,"This Syrah appeals to all the senses, leading with blackberry, bramble, kirsch, mineral and crushed flower aromas. The palate is rich and dense, holding nothing back with its opulent black fruit flavors. A hedonistic expression of the variety."
Tin Barn,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,19.0,2,"This giant of a wine has aromas of charred oak, wood smoke and black pepper, with a palate of dense, deep and smoky tones that feel thick, tannic and chewy. It's a tour de force of spicy oak, fruit concentration and mouthcoating texture that's impressive to drink now but will be best after 2024."
Tin Barn,Syrah,86.33,25.67,3,"A superdark color and effusive aromas of wood smoke, raisin and dried fig set the stage for extremely concentrated, ripe fruit on the palate and a thickly tannic texture. The exuberance of the grape and blackberry flavors nicely counterbalances the firm texture. This will age well, so best to drink it after 2020."
Tin Barn,Zinfandel,89.0,29.0,1,"There's a sultry aromatic combination of stewed strawberry and bright raspberry as well as subtle thyme, tarragon, rosewater and French toast on the nose of this bottling from the iconic vineyard. The baked red fruits and hard woody spices are cut by pungent acidity and firm tannins on the sip. Hold off a bit on this one, but then enjoy for decades. Drink 2019–2034."
Tinto Rey,Red Blend,90.0,22.0,1,"Fans of unoaked wine should look elsewhere. This is a sophisticated but showy wine matured in 100% new Hungarian oak barrels. It has lots to enjoy from the seductive aromas of melted butter and toasted almonds to the rich mouthfeel, ripe fruit flavors and extended, creamy-tasting finish."
Tinto Rey,Verdejo,88.0,18.0,1,"Black currant, lavender, black pepper, soy and graphite show on the nose of this bottling by Zac Wasserman, an assistant to Joey Tensley. There is a flash of lavender at the tip of the sip, and then the darkness descends, with charred meats and blackened berries cut by a strong acidity. It still needs time to develop, but these wines disappear fast, so stock up."
Toad Hollow,Merlot,85.33,16.33,3,"Quiet and aromatically floral, this is a wine given time in both stainless steel and concrete, as well as a sizable percentage of neutral French oak. Lemon zest and grapefruit adorn a robust body of stony minerality and touches of spicy lemongrass."
Toad Hollow,Pinot Noir,88.67,14.67,3,"Baked red cherry, vanilla dust and a slight edge of bay leaf show on this well-rounded estate bottling from the pioneering brand. Ripe raspberry and pomegranate meet with sagebrush, anise and more bay leaf on the sip."
Tobacco Road,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.17,111.17,6,"A perennial knockout, this wine continues to impress. The estate-grown grapes are picked specifically to make a bone-dry refreshing palate pleaser that's pretty in pink and orange tones. Tart, crisp and broadly appealing, it's an effortless experience dripping in grapefruit and blood orange."
Tobin James,Zinfandel,88.0,38.0,1,"Crisp, light and dry, this wine is ready for the next lunch, brunch or warm-weather cocktail party. It has light, melon aromas, refreshing peach and melon flavors and an appetizing, tangy texture."
Toboni,Pinot Noir,87.0,45.0,1,"With an oily, viscous entry, this wine is refreshing in wild golden raspberry and almond flavors and an abundance of floral aromas. Made in a full-bodied style, and definitely varietal, it finishes with a thickness of pineapple."
Toccata,Red Blend,91.5,31.0,2,"This is a bright, fresh and juicy version of the variety from a mountainous and indeed rocky appellation. A touch of leather rides over the proceedings, which consist mostly of red cherry, raspberry and cinnamon."
Tofanelli Family,Charbono,90.0,39.0,2,"Strawberry blossoms, candied cherries, cola and a touch of chipped slate make an appearance on the nose of this bottling. A cinnamon and clove spice component flavor the palate, where cooked black cherries, tart black plum peel, condensed lilac and cedar elements also show."
Together,Red Blend,84.0,43.0,1,"Suave aromas of bramble and red berries meet with chipped slate, a touch of anise and pressed lilacs on this nose of this blend of 37% Grenache, 29% Mourvèdre, 13% Syrah, 10% Counoise, 6% Cinsault and 5% Carignane. Bright cranberry and red cherry fruit pop on the palate, which is bolstered by fennel, black peppercorns and dried rose petals."
Tognetti,Chardonnay,92.0,55.0,2,"This blend of 55% Roussanne and 45% Grenache Blanc offers broad aromas of cooked apples, honeydew melon and peach custard. The palate is tighter, with seared green apples, lemon rind and yellow grapefruit zest, then slowly opens more tropically, with banana elements. This is a full-bodied white wine."
Tolosa,Chardonnay,89.6,39.0,5,"This is the producer's first barrel-aged Chardonnay, made from a blend of two vineyards and two clones, including one from their own estate on Westside Road. Sour and sweet alternatively, it finds a steely path to balance and soft layers of apple, Asian pear and a touch of ginger-topped butterscotch."
Tolosa,Pinot Noir,90.41,48.47,17,"A severity of tannin and heat opens this wine before mellowing into soft, juicy red raspberry and plum. Remaining relatively light bodied and restrained for the variety, it becomes softer on the chocolaty midpalate before a grippy finish grabs back the power."
Tolosa,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,28.0,1,"A robust, full-bodied expression of earth and forest mark this well-made wine, a touch of spearmint surrounding red and black cherry."
Tolosa,Syrah,89.5,46.0,2,"The aromas bring generous notes of botrytis, chamomile, flowers, peach, ale and green apple. It drinks off dry, with well-balanced stone fruit and floral flavors that linger."
Tom Gore,Red Blend,87.0,40.0,1,"Tart, acidic red fruit—pomegranate, sour raspberry—is given some sweet spice and sandalwood from barrel aging. The all-too-typical earthy/herbal aromas that plague so many Oregon Pinots are out in force. The wine sits in the mouth, sour and tight, without enough weight or texture to hint at future pleasure."
Tondré,Chardonnay,91.0,25.0,2,"Bright and colorful, somewhere between a salmon pink and a light copper, this fresh rosé tastes of strawberries and wild raspberries. The finish is lightly spicy and showing just a hint of milk chocolate."
Tondré,Pinot Noir,92.0,40.0,2,"Honeysuckle scents and flavors of pear, papaya and cucumber lead into a fresh and delicate wine, with plenty of acid behind the crisp fruit."
Tongue Dancer,Chardonnay,92.0,50.0,1,"This wine is reduced and somewhat flat in tone, with simple, light-bodied ripeness and plum and raspberry flavors."
Tongue Dancer,Pinot Noir,92.0,55.0,4,"Not quite as bold as its name suggests, this wine is well-balanced and fun to sip. Fruity and medium-bodied, it smells like raspberries and rhubarb, tastes like red cherries and feels nicely full on the palate, bolstered by a hearty dose of fine tannins."
Tooth and Nail,G-S-M,90.0,70.0,1,"Ripe and sweet blackberry jam and dried fig flavors fill out this Port-style sweet wine. Good doses of tannin and acidity keep it structured enough to not feel cloying, lending a little textural grip."
Tooth and Nail,Malbec,93.0,30.0,1,"The aromas in this wine are light, with notes of herb, citrus and orange peel. The palate is dry and broad, with tart citrus flavors. Although appealing, it seems a bit generic."
Tooth and Nail,Petite Sirah,92.0,30.0,1,"This is a stiff, tannic wine with wood smoke and tart cherry flavors and a firm, mouth-puckering texture that persists on the finish. It leads with a lush blackberry jam aroma but then closes in and tightens up."
Tooth and Nail,Red Blend,91.0,30.0,1,"This is made from a majority of Petit Verdot with small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Dusty sage and raspberry notes form waves of big flavor and tannin, the fruit modest."
Topanga,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,25.0,1,"Toast, Bosc pear, spice, lees and flower aromas are followed by a sleekly styled palate. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
Torii Mor,Chardonnay,91.0,35.0,1,"The fig, licorice and spice aromas seem somewhat dried out and tired. The cherry and cranberry flavors are smooth, with the tannins showing some grit. Drink now."
Torii Mor,Pinot Noir,88.52,55.78,50,"This wine shows unusually prominent aromas and flavors of dried rice that are followed by wilted flowers, dried leaves, cocoa and dark fruit. It doesn't all come together."
Tortoise Creek,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.57,11.57,7,"This wine comes in with a low, unheard-of (in Washington) 12.2% alcohol. The aromas offer reticent and unusual notes of wheat, lemongrass, tobacco, vanilla and herbs while the flavors are tart and supple. It doesn't seem outright underripe but comes off as faint."
Tortoise Creek,Chardonnay,85.67,11.67,6,"From a certified organic, dry-farmed vineyard, this wine exudes an overabundance of rustic earth without finding a rightful companion in fruit, with just the merest hint of allspice underplayed on the finish."
Tortoise Creek,Merlot,84.4,11.8,5,"This is a complex wine, jammy and funky in pomegranate and orange notes that are acid-driven but not lacking in fruit or spice components. Soft and silky on the palate, it conveys a twinge of sandalwood to round things out on the long finish."
Tortoise Creek,Pinot Noir,87.0,12.0,2,"High in acidity and well-defined minerality, this wine is also soft and velvety, with a sensibility of crushed rocks and preserved lemon. From a younger block of the famed Ritchie Vineyard, it celebrates youthful playfulness on the palate, with a long-lasting, voluptuous finish."
Tortoise Creek,Sauvignon Blanc,85.33,12.0,3,"Once again this designate amazes with a surfeit of beautifully integrated flavors. Mushrooms and baking spices adorn an explosion of strawberry pastries. There's plenty of ripe cherry fruit also, and a long, polished, lip-licking finish."
Tortoise Creek,Zinfandel,86.8,11.8,5,"Homer is the reserve cuvée, a barrel-selection seemingly chosen for a bit of extra concentration. It retains its elegance, with scents of lavender, incense and Asian spices leading into bright, intense flavors of cherry and plum. The wine gathers itself in the midpalate, showing that fruit density, and finishes with a lick of chocolate. Drink 2018–2030."
Tranche,Cabernet Franc,91.0,35.0,3,"Crisp lemon and a light touch of oak provide a framework around memorably spicy bits of lemongrass and ginger. Along with a tightness of minerality, there's a complexity and succulence to this wine, which lingers elegantly in all of its elements on the finish."
Tranche,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,41.25,4,"Bright cherry fruit expands in the glass, with a hard-candy character, juicy acids, and polished tannins. It's forward, as per the vintage, but structured for further development. Pretty spices and a lick of caramel come up in the finish. Drink now through 2025."
Tranche,Chardonnay,90.0,45.0,3,"Light and a little cloudy in the glass, this is a delicious and deep wine from a vineyard in the eastern Salinas Valley, with lime blossoms, squeezed lemons, wet cement and salted white peach on the nose. The palate deftly pairs chalk, sour cream, and lime zest with dried white peach, sea salt and fresh churned butter."
Tranche,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.5,35.0,4,"An aromatic blend of 46% Viognier, 37% Roussanne, 17% Riesling, this bears complex scents and flavors of oranges and apricots, which are joined by notes of grapefruit and melon, and complemented with juicy acidity. One-third was barrel fermented in neutral oak, and a portion was left on its lees for added texture."
Tranche,Rhône-style White Blend,91.75,30.0,4,"Windthrow is a southern Rhône-style blend—66% Syrah, the rest a mix of Mourvèdre and Grenache. Dense, dark and smoky, it's got a peppery nose, followed by bright raspberry fruit and an accent of roasted game bird. The wine has both lift and length, with sharp acidity."
Tranche,Rosé,89.5,17.5,4,"A blend of 75% Sauvignon Blanc and 25% Sémillon, this definitely reflects the cool 2011 vintage in its steely tension. The clean green-fruit flavors are well defined and highlighted with notes of grassy herbs and saline minerality."
Tranche,Sangiovese,91.0,30.0,1,"This bone-dry, Southern Rhône-style blend consists of 61% Grenache, 18% Mourvèdre, 12% Cinsault and 9% Counoise. Elegant and detailed flavors of light berry and Bing cherry are dusted with a cocoa accent."
Tranche,Syrah,91.5,37.5,4,"This is a brambly, blueberry-laden Petite Sirah, with black cherry, plum and chocolate highlights. Firm, ripe tannins bring a streak of lemon verbena. It's gently earthy, absolutely flavorful and drinking beautifully."
Tranche,Tempranillo,90.0,30.0,1,"Big and quite tannic, this is a blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot. The combination of Red Mountain fruit and the naturally tannic Petit Verdot is balanced against by the tart, juicy berry flavors and the influence from having aged in 100% new French oak. Nothing shy here, but the floral and citrusy aromatics add a welcome layer of complexity."
Tranche,Viognier-Roussanne,94.0,30.0,1,"It's labeled simply Columbia Valley but in fact it's made from all Red Mountain fruit. Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon dominant, with a splash of Petit Verdot, this is quite ripe and sweetly juicy—like a big bowl of blackberries. Aged in once-used French oak, it has picked up some char and graphite notes."
Transcendence,Chardonnay,91.67,34.0,3,"Based on Petit Verdot, this blend is tart and toasty as well as tangy and seemingly slightly sweet from its luscious black fruits. Peppery tannins and highlights of cedar and roasted meat add further interest."
Transcendence,G-S-M,93.0,34.0,1,"This is a meaty, brawny Cab, unexpected for a cool vintage from a cool pocket of the Napa Valley. In aromas and flavors, it is dominated by smoke and meaty bacon, with a side of coffee."
Transcendence,Pinot Noir,91.25,40.5,4,"A pleasant, easy drinker with notes of red apple, melon and jasmine. It's fleshy in feel with some residual sugar sweetening the finish."
Transcendence,Syrah,91.0,38.0,1,"A blend of Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this has strong notes of barnyard that take over the wine, with the flavor concentration not able to stand up to it. Tasted twice with consistent notes."
Trathen Hall,Pinot Noir,91.25,46.5,4,"A bit thin on the nose, this has buttery apple juice aromas. The acidity is a bit off, both tart and mixed with vanilla creaminess, and the flavors are slight with apple candy and tart lemon."
Tre Anelli,Grenache,88.0,28.0,1,"An appealing quaffer with notes of passion fruit, papaya and citrus. It drinks a hair off dry (1.2g/L residual sugar), with moderate concentration, and goes down easy."
Tre Nova,Barbera-Nebbiolo,87.0,30.0,1,"Dried, concentrated red fruit and raspberry syrup aromas combine for a delicious smelling nose on this wine from southern Monterey County, near Paso Robles. It is surprisingly thin and rough on the palate, with modest blueberry flavor and peppery spice."
Tre Nova,Red Blend,88.0,35.0,5,"The first Boushey vineyard Roussanne from McCrea includes a 25% portion of Grenache Blanc. The wine is sharp and high-toned, with a bit of burn to the finish. The fruit flavors dance around the fringes of tropical, with a softer melon core. Though barrel fermented in neutral oak, some tasty, toasty flavors abound."
Tre Nova,Sangiovese,88.33,45.0,3,"This is half Tempranillo, one quarter Garnacha, one quarter Monastrell. Pop the cork and right away come aromas with a mix of exotic, seductive spices, vanilla, sweet grain, plum and some bakery sweetness. The fruit is plump and dotted with dried herb, dusted with powdered sugar, open and expansive."
Treana,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,91.0,45.0,1,"This is the artist label Merlot; a firm, spicy expression of fruit from the Lewis vineyard. Threads of liquid smoke, spice and coffee are woven into the red fruits—a mix of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavors. Still young and sharp, it has some heat in the finish. Additional bottle age recommended."
Treana,Rhône-style White Blend,91.0,30.0,1,"Made from 100% Sangiovese, grown on the shores of Lake Chelan, one of Washington's newest and smallest AVAs. The extra year in bottle has softened and opened the aromas, which bring exceptional complexity to what might appear to be a more simple wine. Not just fruity, though there is plenty of tangy strawberry nectar, along with hints of orange peel and chai tea. The complexity here is remarkable."
Trefethen,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,60.0,1,"This red has a fruity, jammy nose with a peppery kick. On the palate it's a mixture of spicebox, cherry, coffee and pepper. Approachable and well made—a good everyday drinking red."
Trefethen,Chardonnay,88.25,39.25,4,"Blueberry, blackberry and cherry on the nose are followed by integrated but sophisticated flavors of cherry, dark fruit and spice. A friendly, elegant wine with some aging potential; pair with venison, beef."
Trefethen,Riesling,89.33,25.0,3,"From 10-year-old vines at a vineyard in the foothills of the Blue Mountains east of town, this is a lush and loamy Syrah, smelling and tasting of moist earth, game and blood. There are some roasted tomato flavors along with light red fruits, but this is no wimpy wine; in fact, it gathers strength and concentration as it sits in the mouth, suggesting that it needs more years in the bottle to fully emerge from its shell."
Treleaven,Vignoles,87.0,23.0,1,"Aggressively tannic, this is an earthy red wine with a lot of barrel influence. The fruit vanishes into a mélange of pepper, clove, coffee and tannin."
Trentadue,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,38.0,1,"A very light Syrah, with pleasant watermelon and raspberry fruit, that hangs in there until the fairly soft tannins take over."
Trentadue,Petite Sirah,90.0,34.0,1,"An off-dry blend of Viognier, Pinot Gris, Gewürztraminer and Riesling, this has a full midpalate with plenty of peach and apricot fruit. From there it stays simple and slightly sweet right through the finish."
Trentadue,Red Blend,85.0,15.0,1,"This 100% Sangiovese from this Sierra Foothills Sangiovese specialist has a giant mouthfeel, full of plummy and earthy dark cherry and caramel molasses. As big as the wine is, the tannins are softened and the wine has a long finish. An excellent wine to pair with Italian sausage, risotto or so many other Italian-inspired meals."
Trentadue,Sangiovese,86.0,20.0,1,"A blend of all five Bordeaux varieties (61% Cab Sauvignon, 14% Merlot, 11% Petit Verdot, 7% Cab Franc and 7% Malbec), mostly from the Del Arroyo Vineyard, Supremacy is young winemaker Collin Cranor's showcase of what the right fruit and the right winemaking in Livermore Valley can do with the right vision. Juicy, full and fruity, the wine has considerable length and texture, great cherry-berry flavors, the whole package decently balanced."
Trenza,Red Blend,89.0,33.0,4,"Well-modulated fruit and spice flavors rest on a moderately tannic and velvety texture, giving this dry wine a suave feel despite being full bodied. Blended with Petit Verdot, Malbec and Petite Sarah, it's also one of the best values in a big, beefy Cabernet."
Treos,Muscat,87.0,23.0,2,"This wine is half Viognier, with the balance Roussanne (35%) and Marsanne. The aromas of wild flowers, pear, peach, almond and grape skin lead to sweet full-feeling stone fruit notes that are quite flavorful. It shows a pleasing sense of balance."
Treos,Pinot Noir,87.29,39.86,7,"Aromas of cigar box, green herb, asphalt and cherry are followed by sweet fruit flavors that display a very pretty sense of styling. It doesn't quite all come together but delivers plenty of intrigue, showing a fine sense of elegance."
Treos,White Blend,86.0,21.0,1,"Smoky aromas, rich dark-fruit flavors and a plush mouthfeel add up to a powerful, concentrated wine. Made from Syrah, Mataró (Mourvèdre) and other Rhône grape varieties, it has a mouthcoating richness, nice depth to the blackberry flavors and a lingering finish."
Tres Sabores,Red Blend,90.0,30.0,3,"Light in color, this wine brings brooding aromas of red fruit, herb, spice and tire rubber. The red-fruit flavors are light and elegant, pulling up toward the finish."
Tres Sabores,Rosé,90.0,28.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Grenache (53%), Syrah (22%), Mourvèdre (17%), Counoise (5%) and Cinsault. Smoke, char and black pepper aromas are predominant along with notes of tire rubber, white pepper and red fruit. The red-fruit flavors are lighter in style, showing a pretty sense of styling."
Tres Sabores,Zinfandel,94.0,38.0,1,"This wine comes from older vines at Conner Lee, Dionysus and Elephant Mountain vineyards. Light aromas of herb, dark plum, menthol and licorice lead to quite sweet full-bodied fruit flavors and a warm finish. It delivers a sense of hedonism and unabashed appeal, though the variety doesn't seem entirely clear."
Treveri Cellars,Chardonnay,89.0,14.0,2,"Intense wild berry and pomegranate fruit anchors a spicy, balanced, ageworthy Syrah with notes of Provençal herbs. Tart and still quite young, it is already nicely melded together. Spicy/herbal/peppery aromas show just a hint of a green edge, leading into the characteristic Boushey aromatics of violets, with notes of earth and truffle and ground coffee."
Treveri Cellars,Gewürztraminer,87.0,17.0,1,"This captivating wine treads the line between Rhône and Bordeaux. A splash of Cabernet, though just a fraction of the blend, stands out. The wine has depth and persistence, and the mix of grapes works well, showing brambly red fruits, like a Zin, spice and pepper, like Syrah, and some herbal and leafy tobacco in the finish. Complex, unique and quite appealing."
Treveri Cellars,Pinot Noir,88.0,20.0,1,"This is an untamed traditional-style wine that is tannic to its core and may require 20 years to reach its peak of enjoyment. It has aromas of blackberry and black pepper, flavors of espresso and bitter chocolate and a titanic structure built with layer after layer of muscular tannins that leave quite an astringent effect on the finish. Best after 2025."
Treveri Cellars,Sparkling Blend,90.0,14.0,1,"Kendall-Jackson helped define the buttery oaky Chardonnay movement, and this bottling plays that card quite strongly. Oak meets with roasted nuts, sea salt, pecan brittle and Gravenstein apple on the nose. The rounded palate shows sandalwood, candied walnuts and chamomile, though oak is very prominent as well."
Trig Point,Chardonnay,88.0,20.5,2,"This blend of 57% Marsanne, 40% Roussanne and 3% Grenache Blanc manages to be very light and crisp on the nose, with aromas of underripe nectarine and apricot as well as lemon peels and crushed white rocks. There is a defined grip to the sip, with lemon and nectarine flavors."
Trig Point,Merlot,89.0,19.0,1,"This is a very wood-driven bottling, starting with strong cigar box on the nose alongside broad lilac, baked blackberry, spearmint and slate aromas. Cedar spice dominates the palate, allowing just hints of blueberry and wild herbs to emerge. It presents balanced tannin and acidity."
Trig Point,Zinfandel,86.0,19.0,1,"This wine is brightly aromatic, with raspberry, mint, herb and woodspice notes. The palate is full of plush, plump fruit flavors that provide appeal, despite the prominent alcohol."
Trinchero,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,70.0,2,"In this blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, vanilla, carob, herb, green wood and dark fruit aromas are followed by fruit and oak-derived flavors in equal proportion. It shows restraint but doesn't come together."
Trinchero,Cabernet Franc,92.0,50.0,1,"Anise, barrel spice, clove, vanilla and plum scents lead to full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors in this wine. It shows some warmth on the finish, with lingering purple fruit and pepper notes."
Trinchero,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.42,61.67,12,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (34%), Merlot (33%), Cabernet Franc (17%) and Petit Verdot brings vanilla, baker's chocolate, woodspice, dried herb and cherry aromas. It's medium bodied on the palate, with cherry flavors and cinnamon accents throughout."
Trinchero,Malbec,92.0,50.0,2,"Cabernet Sauvignon (54%) takes the lead in this wine, followed by Merlot (31%) and Cabernet Franc (15%). The aromas are all high toned, including spice, dried dark fruit and herb notes. The black fruit shows depth, framed by lightly dry tannins and a gamy flavor that lingers on the finish."
Trinchero,Merlot,91.0,40.0,1,"Fermented in neutral oak barrels and aged sur lie for 7 months, this wine, which includes 6% Viognier, brings herb, honeycomb, pear and orange peel aromas. It drinks dry, with sleek, citrusy flavors."
Trinchero,Petit Verdot,88.0,60.0,1,"A handful of vineyards and additions of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot make up the whole of this wine, a cool-climate style accented in spicy red currant, cherry and woody tannin. With an earthiness of compost and wood, it shows a touch of reduction as it finishes."
Trinitas,Chardonnay,87.33,48.33,3,"Velvety smooth, and brimming with ripe berry flavors, this wine feels broad and rich on the palate, carrying flavors like black plums and boysenberry jam. So ripe it's almost sweet, the wine is nothing if not generous and fruity. A 7% addition of Port-style sweet wine gives it that extra dimension."
Trinitas,Petite Sirah,87.67,35.0,3,"Light and lean on entry, this wine builds up steam and power as it develops in the glass, becoming a robust exploration of rhubarb and cranberry. The texture on the palate is velvety and moderately rich, dotted in sultry spice."
Trinitas,Red Blend,91.0,30.0,1,"The Daou brothers' heady blend of 62% Merlot and 38% Cabernet Sauvignon is very dark in the glass, offering blueberry, espresso, cream and dark chocolate ganache on the lush nose. Blackberry jam, tobacco, pencil lead and oregano show on the palate, where firm structure and juicy acidity leaves the mouth uplifted."
Trinitas,Zinfandel,84.0,25.0,1,"Baked plum, smoked pork, red currant and fresh oregano show on the clean nose of this blend of 53% Grenache, 31% Syrah and 16% Mourvèdre. Baked strawberry, boysenberry and red currant show on the palate at first, but it quickly evolves into dried flowers and extra spicy vanilla, all framed by a tarry tension and biting acidity."
Trinity Vineyards,Pinot Noir,93.0,45.0,1,"A handsome vein of toasted oak flavor runs through this opulently ripe wine from the aroma to the lingering finish. Along the way firm tannins and bright acidity buoy up the lavishly concentrated blackberry and boysenberry elements to present a dry, nicely textured and appetizingly tannic wine."
Trio Vintners,Grenache,88.0,26.0,2,"This wine is a tour de force, dripping with luscious fruit flavor and packing power in the full-body and lip-smacking texture. The aromas are classic, ripe raspberry and blackberry, lightly spiced with oak, and the flavors ooze more wild berry and pomegranate. With concentration like this and a lively structure of fine tannins, it's good to drink now but will improve through 2020."
Trio Vintners,Mourvèdre,90.0,26.0,3,"Very fresh and inviting aromas of blueberry, plum, rich rose petal and vanilla bean show on the nose of this blend of 65% Grenache, 30% Mourvèdre and 5% Tannat. Once sipped, mulberry, vanilla and red cherry mesh with lavish clove and baking spice, creating an elegant and layered wine."
Trio Vintners,Red Blend,86.5,19.0,2,"This wine combines both the richer, ripe style of Pinot Noir with an underripe, herbaceous strategy. Dill, thyme, bay leaf and camphor show on the nose, as does dense elderberry and cranberry. The palate offers much woody intensity as well as green olives, baked tomatoes, peppercorns and annatto seeds, yet also shows baked black plum as the core fruit. Quite an intriguing combo."
Trio Vintners,Riesling,89.0,12.0,1,"This tiny-production wine continues to impress vintage after vintage, a small project of the Nunes family, who otherwise farm Nunes Vineyard. Aged in a selection of new and once and twice-used French oak, it impresses in wound-up kirsch, baked bread and cardamom spice, remaining both high toned and smoothly complex on the palate. Rose petals and citrus flirt into the body of the wine as well as the finish."
Trio Vintners,Sangiovese,88.0,28.0,1,"This single-clone, estate-grown wine shows exemplary concentration. Deeply sculpted fruit flavors roll from peach to papaya, with streaks of buttery caramel. Everything is in proportion, with a most pleasing finish."
Trione,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.33,54.67,3,"Inky dark in the glass, this blend of 48% Syrah, 39% Grenache and 13% Mourvèdre offers up dense and potent blackberry and blueberry fruit aromas, enhanced by black pepper and bacon-fat richness. Blackberry fruit starts the sip and then it deepens into earth, tobacco and smoke. It's a fine study of darkness."
Trione,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.67,67.0,3,"Tasted alongside the 2013, this is bigger, bolder, fruitier and more powerful, yet a touch less refined. The strawberry and cherry fruit is underscored with a pleasing minerality. The tannins are substantial and in proportion. A hint of chicken stock runs through the finish."
Trione,Chardonnay,90.2,33.2,5,"A full-bodied, robust expression of the variety from an appellation that can sometimes be relatively cool, this shows deft characteristics of savory pepper, cedar and a tightness of lively acidity. While fresh it's also heavy, with a finish of black tea."
Trione,Pinot Noir,89.25,38.5,4,"Light honey on red apple and apple blossom aromas show on this blend of 42% Viognier, 30% Grenache Blanc, 23% Marsanne and 5% Roussanne. The flavors combine honey brittle with lemon skins, ripe Borsch pear and a warmer yellow melon fruit element."
Trione,Sauvignon Blanc,91.0,23.0,3,"Fresh apple blossoms, lemon-lime soda and fragrant key lime pie aromas waft off of this bottling from the hillside vineyard that was one of the first in California to offer this grape. Similar key lime flavors show on the palate as does freshly squeezed pear juice, which offers a ripe, rounded character."
Trione,Syrah,90.0,32.0,1,"Light red cherry, dried sage, black tea and thyme show on the nose of this bottling from the iconic facility in the heart of its namesake valley. There is a lot of action on the palate, where tart cherry and plum skin flavors meet with dried mint and earthy shrub elements."
Trisaetum,Chardonnay,92.0,49.0,1,"Smoky notes of roasted meat and white pepper spice up the plum skins and blackberry fruit that show on the nose of this bottling. The smoke is also prominent on the sip, where graphite minerality frames the blueberry and blackberry fruit. The character of slightly burnt balsamic reduction sauce also shows through."
Trisaetum,Pinot Noir,92.63,57.05,19,"Aromas and flavors like raisins and dried figs, together with full body and a fairly thick texture make this wine mouth filling and rich. It's nice and dry, yet the flavors are so ripe that a sense of sweetness comes through."
Trisaetum,Riesling,93.43,29.5,28,"Brambly berry and heaps of brown sugar combine for a thick, soft and richly layered wine that pushes the limits in terms of ripeness. It has small amounts of Mourvèdre, Charbono and Carignane blended throughout and was aged in one-third new French oak."
Triumph,Red Blend,87.0,45.0,1,"A strong, smoky, grilled-sage aroma and similar flavors give this wine plenty of personality. It's medium bodied, dry and shows the herbal side of the variety, with a lively mouthfeel and light tannins."
Troll Bridge,Red Blend,85.0,75.0,1,"Very mellow and mature tasting, this full-bodied wine leaves no rough edges or elbows sticking out, so sipping it is a pleasure. Aromas are savory, herbaceous and lightly earthy rather than fruity, and the flavors follow the same path."
Trombetta,Chardonnay,92.75,51.25,4,"Black plum, mulberry and a touch of graphite show on the nose of this bottling. Ripe cranberry and pomegranate juice form a tangy fruit base on the palate, enhanced by oregano, cinnamon and, on the finish, some juniper."
Trombetta,Pinot Noir,93.0,65.0,2,"Comprised 100% of this rare variety, this wine was given time to ferment and age in French oak, half of it new. Ashy red fruit meets a mild structure and considerable tannic grip; only a tiny amount was made."
Troon,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,25.5,2,"Perfumed in rose and violet, this full-bodied wine is leathery and somewhat dull on the palate, opting for savory elements over fruit."
Troon,Malbec-Tannat,91.0,50.0,2,"This blend of 53% Grenache, 23% Petite Sirah, 20% Syrah and 4% Viognier offers cinnamon spice, red cherry and slight pomegranate on the nose. The palate shows tangy cranberry fruit, a bit of baking spice and a very clay-like minerality and texture."
Troon,Meritage,88.0,33.0,3,All five Bordeaux red varieties are represented in this wine that puckers in sizable tannin and oak. Tobacco and pencil shavings add savory character to its full-bodied concentration.
Troon,Red Blend,90.0,50.0,1,"Rich and toasty, round and full across the palate, this thoroughly-enjoyable new release is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with a splash of Cabernet Franc. It was aged 17 months in 60% new French oak, yielding a spicy, chocolaty wine, with vivid, bright fruit flavors of cherries and plums. Excellent length, balance and texture."
Troon,Rosé,85.0,18.0,1,"Fragrant and plush aromas of cassis, blueberry and black cherry mix with strong notes of licorice and black olive. Silky, detailed, supple and beautifully proportioned, this is a terrific value."
Troon,Syrah,86.67,50.0,3,"Sharp and herbal, this new Rediviva has a high-acid, peppery profile. It penetrates deeply into the palate, with excellent length. The herbal side of both the Syrah and the Cabernet is what is most forcefully expressed."
Troon,Tannat,89.0,30.67,3,"Broad and toasty, the 2008 Andreas is pure Cabernet Sauvignon from the Wallula Vineyard. Lush plum and cherry fruit is set against generous, toasty new oak. Nuanced highlights of herb, rye seed and even a dash of cayenne peek through on the finish. The wine spent a full year in bottle prior to release, but could certainly age for another decade or more, and is likely to improve significantly."
Troon,Vermentino,86.0,24.0,1,"Very few wines present such intense florality as does this bottling that smells like a potpourri sachet, full of dried violets, dried lavender and eucalyptus, with touches of dust, chipped slate and black plum. Those flowers carry to the palate as well, where lavender, blossoming thyme and green peppercorns show."
Troon,Viognier,86.0,22.0,1,"Superfresh and fennel-laced on the nose, this cool-climate Syrah shows underripe plums, raspberry, charcoal, lavender, pepper sauce, thyme and forest underbrush on the nose. It's impressively floral on the energetic, not overly dense sip, with lavender, rosehip and white sage touches enlivening the dark red fruit."
Troon,White Blend,87.0,34.0,2,"This unique blend of Dundee Hill Pinot Noir and Walla Walla Syrah seduces instantly with a bouquet redolent of smoke and licorice, tobacco and vanilla. Though it's Syrah that seems dominant, adding flavors of supple purple fruits to the aromatic mix, it seems apparent that the Pinot Noir component extends the finish, turning a potent and powerful wine into one that exits with delicacy and breeding."
Troon,Zinfandel,87.67,24.67,6,"This wine is full of lovely aromas and flavors, but something unique about its grippy texture makes it soar. It begins with fresh, mineral-laced scents of Asian pear, yellow-grapefruit pith, crisp yellow apple and chalk. Then comes a palate full of yellow apple skins, lemon wedge and the slightest hint of grass, all served atop energetic, mouthwatering acidity."
Trotter 1/16,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,70.0,2,"This wine is a blend of fruit from Les Collines, Forgotten Hills and SJR vineyards. It brings brooding but complex aromas of smoked meat, fresh herbs, citrus twist, red and blue fruit and mineral. The violet and red and blue fruit flavors show restraint and elegance, with an emphasis on purity."
Truchard,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,38.0,2,"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah sites, this wine opens with high-toned aromas of herb, blue fruit and iron, along with light savory accents. The flavors are full, broad and palate coating, showing an exquisite sense of balance and length that kicks it up a notch. Exquisite stuff."
True Myth,Chardonnay,87.0,18.0,2,"This vineyard-designate from a lovely, coastal site imparts flavors and aromas of golden and green apple along with noticeably juicy apricot and peach. Light bodied, it shows an exuberance of fruit alongside notable minerality and a slight hint of sea spray."
True Vine,Petite Sirah,86.0,28.0,1,"From the rocky, volcanic soils of the mighty, high-elevation vineyard, this wine imparts generous layers of blood-red berry, smoke, vanilla and cranberry, a testament to terroir and unobtrusive winemaking. Powerfully built in tight, leathery structure, it conveys a distinct taste of that volcanic rock."
Truett Hurst,Chardonnay,85.0,27.0,1,"These Pines Vineyard vines are nearing a century in age. In the new vintage, the wine seems almost brutally powerful, with rough, rugged oak flavors that will want further bottle age to mellow. Ripe blueberry and cherry tones are matched to strong streaks of caramel, cocoa and coconut. Drink 2018–25."
Truett Hurst,Petite Sirah,87.0,35.0,1,"This aromatically brooding wine brings aromas of brown stems, scorched earth, smoked meat, iron, violets, orange peel and blue and black fruit. The flavors coat the palate from end to end with silky soft, unabashedly appealing fruit and savory notes. It hits the delicious gong hard, with an enduring finish."
Truett Hurst,Red Blend,85.0,15.0,1,"The producer veers off its estate program to tap into the beauty and brawn that is Kanzler, a magnificent site of its own. Raspberry and a touch of vanilla swirl around a darkness of allspice and cola, lifted by bold acidity and a wealth of texture. Full bodied, this wine shows plenty of oak that should become more integrated in time."
Truett Hurst,Zinfandel,86.25,29.25,4,"This dry, layered and rich-textured wine smells like fresh-cut canteloupe, tastes like peach and melon, and has a generous, mouthfilling feel."
Trust,Cabernet Franc,89.0,16.0,1,"This wine doesn't appear to have fully come out of its shell, with light aromas of plum, tire rubber, pomegranate, herb and a dusting of spices. The flavors display a pleasing sense of purity, with lightly grainy tannins providing support."
Trust,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,48.0,2,"A deep color and ripe, gushing fruit aromas lead to generous dark cherry and blackberry flavors in this wine. Firm tannins are loosened by a sugary element that lingers on the finish."
Trust,Syrah,91.0,42.0,1,"A deep gold-orange color and floral aromas lead to rich, broad peach and apricot flavors that are moderately sweet and nicely concentrated. Lighter than some late-harvest wines, it has more vivid fruit and better balance than others."
Trust,Sémillon,90.0,40.0,1,"Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah take the lead on this blend. Aromas of wood spice, café au lait, cherry and spice box are followed by tobacco and cherry flavors. There are good things going on but the wood gets a bit out front."
Truth,White Blend,85.0,15.0,1,"Aromas of herb, citrus and mineral are followed by tart, racy citrus flavors. It provides a lot of appeal."
TruthTeller,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.67,33.33,3,"The aromas bring notes of dried and fresh herb, citrus twist, baking spice, wood spice and cherry. The cherry and pencil lead flavors show a sense of poise and polish."
TruthTeller,Red Blend,86.0,40.0,1,"This blend of 46% Sauvignon Blanc, 39% Sémillon and 15% Viognier pleases in a light-bodied frame. Lychee meets lemon, lime and a lengthy complexity of wet stone on the finish."
TruthTeller,Syrah,88.0,40.0,2,"This medium-bodied, nicely firm and approachable red shows cherry, cassis, tobacco and black olive along a juicy core of grippy texture."
TruthTeller,Viognier,87.0,20.0,1,"Crafted from a field blend of varieties, including Carignan, Syrah and Durif, this holds a syrupy sense of meaty bacon and plum raisin at its center. Midweight and fairly straightforward in terms of flavor, it finishes fast and not overly complex."
Tsillan,Gewürztraminer,88.0,14.0,2,"Given the diverse clonal make-up of the vines that go in to this Pinot, the aromas are somewhat muted and shy. Earthy, spicy fruit flavors are characterized by baked red raspberry and strawberry notes, with the wine taking on a denseness on the palate and finish."
Tsillan,Malbec,87.0,32.0,1,"This wine suggests green, savory herbs along with cherry and currant. It's elegant in style, velvety in feel, and delivers good concentration to the fruit flavors plus barrel notes (20% new French) on the lingering finish. The variety gets lost with the herbal notes taking over, but it still offers enjoyment."
Tsillan,Pinot Grigio,88.0,19.0,1,"This Super Tuscan-like blend of 81% Sangiovese and 19% Cabernet Sauvignon, whose name refers to the little stones on the estate, shows reductive aromas of black olive, rubber and dried pressed purple flowers. Flavors range from mushroom to slate, but the tannins need mellowing and it could use a little more air altogether."
Tsillan,Sangiovese,86.0,28.0,1,"This classy, dry wine looks coppery in color, smells like cinnamon and cherries, and tastes crisp and appetizing. It has great balance, good flavors and a lingering finish."
Tsillan,Syrah,86.0,35.0,1,"Cabernet Sauvignon (85%) takes the lead on this blend, with the balance Syrah. It brings aromas of earth, green herbs, citrus and cherry that are followed by ripe cherry flavors and a firm squeeze of slightly dry tannins."
Tsillan,Viognier,87.0,18.0,2,"This is a massively rich style of Chardonnay bordering on fat, but delicious throughout. The nose offers aromas of golden apple slices, jasmine, honeysuckle, marzipan, melon and prominent pineapple. Once sipped, vanilla-laced butter and sea-salt caramel flavors ensure."
Tsillan,White Blend,89.0,16.0,1,"This blend of 39% Petite Sirah, 35% Zinfandel, 19% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Cabernet Franc spent two years in barrel, allowing the flavors to mesh. Juicy acidity marks a soft, approachable palate of sugarplum and kirsch, sure to please a crowd with its full, plush texture."
Tsillan Cellars,Chardonnay,87.0,25.0,1,"This wine combines 38% Cabernet Sauvignon with 35% Merlot, 9% Petit Verdot and 1% Cabernet Franc, with fruit from Stagecoach and Alta vineyards contributing to the mix. Dusty tannin and a weight of leather saddle permeate the nose and palate, with graphite puncturing through the soft texture and finish."
Tsillan Cellars,Red Blend,88.5,28.0,2,"From a site farmed by the great Ulises Valdez, this barrel-aged white is remarkably subtle on the oak, allowing bright, rich flavors of lemon, lime and mango to shine through, along with more complex aspects of green apple and anise."
Tucannon,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,28.0,2,"The aromas pop, with notes of jammy dark cherry, dried black currant, black licorice and baking spices. The dried-fruit flavors are full, with a dry squeeze of tannins. It seems a bit evolved for its age."
Tucannon,Rosé,80.0,18.0,1,"This wine begins with intense oak and a voluptuous texture before settling into the crisp delicacy of bittersweet lemon and honeyed apple. Full bodied and nicely complex, it's a balanced expression of a cool vineyard site."
Tuck Beckstoffer,Grenache,90.0,34.0,1,"Vanilla, clove, baking spice and dark fruit aromas lead to a palate plush with full ripe generous fruit and barrel flavors. It's a hedonistic delight, with the barrel influence playing a prominent role."
Tuck Beckstoffer,Pinot Noir,90.0,85.0,4,"Aromas of prune, licorice and dark fruit lead to full cranberry and cherry flavors. It shows a sense of vitality and liveliness."
Tuck Beckstoffer,Red Blend,88.0,20.0,1,"This wine starts out brooding, with aromas of vanilla, herbs and brown spices. The cherry flavors are full bodied yet show subtlety, with a captivating mouthfeel and meaty flavors on the finish that increase the interest."
Tuck Beckstoffer,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,14.0,1,"Sur lie aging and battonage were extended for 22 months on this wine. It displays aromas of corn silk, almond milk and lees that are followed by an elegant creamy mouthfeel and abundant stone-fruit flavors. The finish lingers."
Tulpen,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,30.5,4,"Named for winemaker Ross Cobb's late mother, who more than 20 years ago planted the Coastlands Vineyards' dry-farmed vines—some of the oldest in the region—this exquisitely distinctive wine celebrates all that is extreme and remarkable about the marriage of site, style and variety. Offering bay laurel in abundance, it has plenty of body to remain vibrant and complex, marked entirely in forest floor and heady allspice, with a nuance of cherry and white pepper on the finish."
Tulpen,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.2,41.2,5,"This has a grand array of exotic flinty, meaty, smoky and spicy aromas. The powerful flavors taste a bit restrained at first sip, then unfold and seem to expand on the palate. Pure and brilliant layers of ripe blackberry, smoked herbs and darkest chocolate ride on an elegant texture of fine tannins and supportive acidity. Drink from 2018–2030."
Tulpen,Red Blend,91.0,30.0,1,"Still tight, and expertly crafted and structured, this single-vineyard estate wine is meticulous in velvety, plush texture, completely seductive at every angle. Rich red cherry, pomegranate and vanilla improvise against one another without ever missing a beat, finishing in fully integrated flavor. Drink now through 2022."
Tulpen,Tempranillo,88.0,38.0,1,"This wine stops you in your tracks with its aromas of earth, peat, fire pit, tapenade and coffee. The flavors are outrageously rich, dense and textured, with a lightly tacky feel to the tannins and a hyperextended finish. It's a knockout."
Tumwater,Pinot Noir,91.5,45.0,2,"Built for aging, this tightly wound, elegant and yet grand wine is sure to develop more nuances and smoothness with time. It smells enticingly like cedar, tobacco and dark chocolate-covered blueberries, yet retains a firmness and reserve that doesn't let those melt into richness on the palate quite yet. Store this confidently in a cool place and enjoy it 2020–2025."
Turchi,Sangiovese,89.0,29.0,1,"A deep color and aromas of toasted baguette, wood smoke and black cherry signal a classic style. The flavors are like dark-chocolate-covered cherries and cranberries. The toasted character of new oak barrels persists from the aroma to the finish, but it's well complemented by ripe fruit, an impressively tannic texture and lingering finish."
Turiya,Petit Verdot,88.0,85.0,1,"The winery's first reserve-level Cabernet, this is pure Cabernet from the Phinny Hill (60%) and Bacchus vineyards. It offers heady aromas of dried herbs, black currant, cherry, tobacco and graphite. The flavors are tightly wound, immediately accessible but fleshing out and ramping up in intensity after several days open. It shows impeccable acid and tannin balance and has a long life ahead of it. Best from 2020–2032."
Turiya,Red Blend,92.2,95.0,5,"From a vineyard site at the southern end of Oakville, where it touches Yountville, this is a gloriously dusty, smooth and age-worthy wine, bright in crisp red cherry and cranberry while offering deeper, darker elements of licorice and toffee. Concentrated, it's substantial and yet balanced, with something to say on the long finish."
Turiya,Sangiovese,93.0,150.0,1,"Made with 75% Merlot with the rest Cabernet Franc, this wine commands attention with aromas of dried and fresh herbs, black fruit, toast and flowers. The dark fruit flavors are rich, layered and tightly coiled, captivating attention with spot-on balance."
Turkovich,Red Blend,91.0,20.0,1,"Cola, sasparilla, cherry blossoms, hard cherry candy and a hint of black currant hit the nose on this rich wine from Josh Jensen. The palate shows brown spice, with clove and peppercorns wrapping around a rhubarb-licorice-thyme character and tart cherries, making for an incredibly distinctive wine."
Turkovich,Sparkling Blend,87.0,32.0,1,"This is an effusively fruity wine blended from three coastal counties, deep in color and jammy in aroma. Ripe and generous in flavor, it features black cherry and boysenberry, moderate tannins and a medium to full body."
Turley,Zinfandel,90.0,32.0,1,"Almost as light in color as water, this is a straight-ahead take on the grape, with tropical-leaning aromas of honeysuckle, ripe papaya and boisterous passionfruit. The palate is much grassier in style, showing cut lawn, kiwi, green pears and kaffir limes, with just a touch of lingering tropical sweetness."
Turnbull,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.5,77.5,6,"Structured from the start, this wine provides succulent boysenberry and blackberry around a full-figured body that's otherwise steeped in vanilla and coffee, the toasted oak quite prevalent. It finishes slightly tart in dried herb and mushroom."
Tuxedo Cellars,Viognier,90.0,24.0,1,"This single-vineyard designate is labeled simply Oregon, but is actually Dundee Hills. Somewhat dilute fruit flavors suggest pomegranate and tart strawberries. Despite 18 months in half new French oak, the wood does not overwhelm the fruit, and the wine actually improves overnight. Give it a good decanting for optimum drinking."
Twill,Pinot Noir,88.0,34.0,1,"This curious blend of 61% Riesling and 39% Sauvignon Blanc manages to succeed, with lime rinds, limestone and wafts of gasoline intriguing the nose. There's not much acidity on the palate, but it does offer a chalky grip along with limeade flavors."
Twill,Syrah,87.0,40.0,2,"Intensely concentrated, this wine offers minerally petrol and hazelnut, particularly on the nose. A salinity marks it on the medium-bodied palate, giving it an intriguing edge before finishing in a squeeze of lemon."
Twisted,Zinfandel,87.0,8.0,2,"Dunham's Riesling, from the same vineyard that supplies grapes for the winery's best red wines, is a rich, luscious, off-dry wine, fresh and loaded with flavors of just-picked peaches."
Twisted Cedar,Red Blend,90.0,15.0,1,"Dark, dense and lush with rock, cracked pepper, Bing cherries, streaks of spice and mocha, this nicely aged and softened Merlot is full and open. The fruit is round and generous, the tannins polished, and the flavors wrapped in delicious baking spices."
Twisted Oak,Garnacha,93.0,32.0,1,"Very fresh and juicy, this mouth-pleasing Viognier mixes peaches and grapefruit, zippy acidity, with highlights of lemon zest. It's beautifully balanced, detailed and refreshing."
Twisted Oak,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,18.0,1,"Though the term late harvest would suggest a sweet, dessert wine, this is more on the off-dry side of Riesling, with juicy acids that cut the impression of sugar. Fragrant with scents and flavors of apricots, apple pie, honey and biscuit, it is expressive, nicely balanced and loaded with flavor."
Twisted Oak,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,24.0,1,"This is 100% single vineyard Merlot; broad, beautifully integrated, with seamless black fruits, streaks of coffee and smoke, and black pepper spice. A powerful Merlot with muscle and verve, it finishes smooth and lightly tasting of chocolate."
Twisted Paso,Red Blend,87.0,20.0,2,"It's 100% Merlot, and it doesn't need any help from any other grapes. Extremely dark and thick in the mouth, this liquorous bruiser of a Merlot is thoroughly delicious. It's just packed with fruit, cassis and ripe black cherries, complemented by dark chocolate notes."
Twisted Twig,Petite Sirah,90.0,48.0,1,"Light, tart and slightly mushroomy, this Pinot might pass for a solid Bourgogne from one of the better négociants. Organically grown grapes add some lightly earthy notes. All in all, quite pleasant."
Twisted Twig,Red Blend,87.0,58.0,2,"High-toned and sharp, this has a mix of pear, tropical fruit, banana, and juicy fruit gum. It's a fruit salad wine, full-bodied and exceptionally flavorful. There's a streak of butterscotch running through the finish, from fermentation in “neutral” oak. Drink up!"
Two Angels,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,27.0,1,"A blend of four traditional Portuguese grape varietals, this unusual offering begins with a distinctly pruney nose, and seems soft and slightly oxidized. But as it breathes it adds interesting flavors of dried herbs and forest floor, rustic and complex."
Two Brothers,Red Blend,85.0,30.0,1,"At just 12.5% alcohol, you'll find this lively, light, fruity Pinot has a sweet core of pretty cherry fruit. Nonetheless, it's dry and finishes with an astringent, leafy, palate-refreshing scrape of tannin. A fine sipping wine, with a resonant finish."
Two Horns,Red Blend,88.0,16.0,1,"One of the winery's tasty bottlings that are odes to Bill Foley's Texas ranch roots, this offers aromas of crushed chalk, fresh apple blossoms and a ruby-red grapefruit peel tartness. The flavors surround a very clean line of lemon juice and lime pith, with more chalk, ripe apples and brisk nectarine. It's still tight and will age well."
Two Moons,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,45.0,2,"A Merlot-based blend with accompanying components of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this estate-grown wine excels in its subdued, smoky and toasty oak surrounded by juicy blackberry and a hint of graphite and leather. Textured and structured, it needs time, and will be happy in the cellar through 2026."
Two Moons,Rhône-style White Blend,89.0,28.0,1,"Saitone is a supremely historic vineyard, planted originally in 1895 in the thick of the Russian River Valley's Olivet Bench, a coveted spot these days for Pinot Noir. The wine offers supple, soft tannins around a juicy intensity of grenadine and berry crumble. The structured backbone of minerality is remarkable."
Two Moons,Roussanne,91.0,28.0,1,"This powerful blend of 23% Malbec, 20% Carmenere, 20% Cabernet Franc, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot and 7% Petite Verdot delivers layered aromas of olallieberry, grape candy, sage, anise and lava rocks. Purple fruits dominate the palate, with complexity provided by creosote and violets, along with ample tannins and acidity."
Two Mountain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,15.0,1,"Dark golden-yellow, this opens with inviting notes of toasted caramel. It remains bright in citrus on the palate, getting riper and steamier as it goes, developing deeper, richer flavors of preserved lemon and baked pear. From the winery's estate, this is a small-production wine well worth seeking."
Two Mountain,Cabernet Franc,86.0,30.0,2,"This is both intense and rarified. The intensity shows in the deep garnet color, the concentrated berry fruit, and the depth of flavor. The acidity elevates it further, lending sharp details and further brightness."
Two Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,37.2,5,"Santa Barbara-raised Steve Gerbac makes a winning white wine with aromas of scorched lemons, browned butter and vanilla, sliced down the middle with white rock minerality. Broad, oak-driven flavors at the tip of the palate quickly tighten into a line of lime zest acidity that lingers, with white pepper and chamomile spices emerging in the midpalate."
Two Mountain,Chardonnay,82.0,55.0,1,"Bright aromas of raspberry and dried rose petals highlight this wine from the southwestern corner of the county, along with black tea, sage and shiitake mushrooms. The flavors are supple and elegant, with light strawberry, pencil shavings and sagebrush making for a fun, energetic wine that really lets the vineyard shine."
Two Mountain,Merlot,87.0,22.0,1,"From this particular block all the vines are the Pommard clone, which keeps it distinctive from the other Shea cuvées. Smooth, silky, slightly smoky and showing a supple mouthfeel, this mixes brambly berry, nougat and caramel notes, with a finishing flourish of toasted hazelnuts."
Two Mountain,Red Blend,85.0,34.0,2,"Austria-trained, Santa Barbara County-based winemaker Graham Tatomer is causing a Riesling renaissance, thanks to wines like this with aromas of orange blossom, citrus rinds and hints of gasoline. With flavors of toasted nuts, lemon juice, tangerine pith and chalky grip, this is a great canvas for cellar aging to paint a remarkable wine. Drink 2018–2030."
Two Mountain,Syrah,89.5,25.0,2,"From the Frediani Vineyard, this is a blend of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon and 24% Cabernet Franc. Perfumed in lavender and a grip of blackberry jam, it also imparts characteristics of plum and clove, allowing both varieties to speak. Smooth on the finish, it's robustly full bodied and fleshy to the end."
Two Sisters,Chardonnay,93.0,51.25,4,"Black plum and elderberry jam aromas mix with leather, tobacco, crushed sage and oregano on this blend of 50% Grenache, 38% Syrah and 12% Petite Sirah from the Warner Springs area. The palate packs lots of crushed herbs, graphite and cedar with dried berries, laced together with firm, sticky tannins."
Two Sisters,Pinot Noir,90.8,76.0,5,"This big and layered wine smells savory and meaty, partnering with a generous helping of ripe blackberries and black cherries on the palate. It has appropriately firm tannins for such a bold wine but stays fruity and easy to drink. Syrah, Barbera, Primitivo and Petite Sirah make the blend."
Two Vintners,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89.5,30.0,4,"Firm tannins meet delicious ripe fruit flavors for good balance in this full-bodied, dry and mouth-coating wine. It tastes like ripe wild berries, with touches of new leather and cardamom."
Two Vintners,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,55.0,2,"This bold, boisterous wine offers a depth of black cherry and is expansive on the palate, tingling in spicy acidity and swathes of cinnamon-laced cola. Silky smooth, it hails from a selection of Dutton Ranch-farmed vineyards, including Thomas Road and Manzana, and delivers full-bodied flavor."
Two Vintners,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,88.0,25.0,1,"This unusual wine, fermented with wild yeasts and using 20% whole bunches, is still pulling all of its diverse components into focus. Grapefruit, citrus, lemon and a saline quality adorn the spare red fruits. The length and persistence are spot on, but this could benefit from another year or two of bottle age before you pop the cork."
Two Vintners,Cinsault,91.5,20.5,2,"From a fine vineyard site, this wine impresses in voluptuous texture and its lovely layers of lemon and apple. Floral on the nose in apple blossom and jasmine, it offers a slight twist of more spiced citrus, like an orange dotted in clove. It spent nine months in French oak, 40% of it new, which adds complexity and notes of toasted oak."
Two Vintners,Gewürztraminer,90.0,28.0,1,"Spicy and green at first, with an aromatic resemblance to salsa and bell peppers. In the mouth, that bell pepper character never goes away, but with time it becomes more subdued as powerful berry fruit and chocolate come on strong. The finish, however, is hard as nails, courtesy of fierce tannins, thus an affinity for tannin is required to get much from this unusual wine."
Two Vintners,Grenache,93.0,30.0,1,"Green and earthy in the nose, with more vegetal aromas than fruity ones. The palate is tangy and also vegetal, while full tannins and some bitterness dominate the finish. Parts of this wine seem to be in shape while others are not. As a whole, it lacks ripeness and overt appeal."
Two Vintners,Grenache Blanc,89.0,25.0,3,"Bright gold in color, with creamy custard and caramel aromas. The palate is soft, with banana, baked apple and corn-like flavors, while the finish is heavy and rather mute. Very thick and heavy given the level of balance, acidity and fruit pedigree."
Two Vintners,Merlot,89.0,32.0,2,"It's hard to get around the slap of high alcohol in this wine, beginning with its diesel-oak nose and ever-present persistence of drying tannins. Bitter tea, cedar and leather add to the bombastic nature of this powerhouse."
Two Vintners,Red Blend,89.83,40.83,6,"No vintage is listed on the label, but the winery says the grapes are all from 2013. This rough and tumble, 50/50 Merlot and Tempranillo blend shows flavors of dirt and mushroom, with light and generic red fruit."
Two Vintners,Roussanne,86.0,20.0,1,Sweet candied apple overpowers this oddly textured and flavored wine.
Two Vintners,Syrah,90.82,40.09,11,"There is something ethereal and beyond words about this wine, a full-bodied but never intrusive expression of spicy cinnamon, black pepper and wild pine that makes it a puzzle worth trying to solve. Fruit plays a part, though softly, eking out shadows of raspberry and just-picked strawberry atop smooth, silky tannins and a measured, seductive body. The finish recalls a clove cigarette enjoyed in the rain."
Two Vintners,Zinfandel,90.0,27.8,5,"Expressive in oak, earth and clove with cinnamon-cola, this savory, complex wine is also impressive in its ability to offer crisp and focused lines of citrus and fresh-picked raspberry. It teeter-totters the variety's ability to be both fruit-forward and elusively hard to reach. Streaks of thyme and rosemary figure into the mix. Drink now through 2023."
Ty Caton,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,44.0,1,"Green olive, green stem and fresh herb aromas are at the fore, with cured meat, peat, smoke and mineral notes close behind. The palate offers dense fruit and savory flavors that command attention, with smoked meat notes that just won't quit. The balance and length are mesmerizing."
Ty Caton,Merlot,87.0,38.0,1,"A vineyard for both Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, Allen is exquisitely detailed in this textured bottling that's weighty, with a tannin backdrop and replete with savory fruit. Wild strawberry, Bing cherry and black tea stand out, with an undercurrent of lushness that's hard to resist."
Ty Caton,Red Blend,89.0,45.33,3,"This first estate-grown bottling of Rediviva is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Syrah. Amazing aromatic complexity grabs you and leads you into the dark interior of the wine, a riot of red and black fruits, moist earth, smoke, anise, herb and toast. Power and elegance combined, with the structure to age for a decade or more."
Ty Caton,Syrah,87.5,33.0,2,"Beautifully floral, fragrant and evocative, with lush and complex aromas of honeycomb, cracker and citrus, carrying into the mouth with rich, bright, detailed flavors. Stone and mineral elements are woven throughout, and the barrel fermentation adds hints of toast."
Tyee,Pinot Gris,87.0,15.0,1,"Among McCrea's Rhône-inspired white wines, this is the most complete and complex. It's rich and dense, with honeycomb, lychee, lemon rind, pineapple and lots of stone—lovely and lingering. It seems to gain strength as it rolls through a sensational finish."
Tyee,Pinot Noir,86.0,35.0,1,"This is a nonvintage blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, Grenache and Cinsault. Well on its way to maturity, it's an easy-drinking quaffer, with a hint of bitterness on the finish."
Tyee Wine Cellars,Pinot Gris,83.5,16.0,2,"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 50% Merlot, The Norseman—named for a vintage airplane—mostly masks its fruit in a wash of earth, herb, stem and tannin."
Tyee Wine Cellars,Pinot Noir,84.0,20.0,1,"Aromas of mandarin orange, peach and herb are followed by lightly styled, off-dry drinking but still well-balanced fruit flavors. It goes down easy."
Tyler Florence,Chardonnay,87.0,20.0,1,"This Pinot Gris is fermented on the skins, then aged in neutral oak for a year-and-a-half. It's a dusty rose in hue, and its tart rhubarb fruit is speckled with peppery spice. The time on skins seems to have amped up the tannins past optimal balance. This is a one-of-a-kind style of Pinot Gris."
Tyler Florence,Meritage,89.0,25.0,1,"This wine's nose and palate bring linzer torte, raspberry jam and charred meat to mind. Thick, big-boned and robust, it finishes on sweet vanilla."
Tyrus Evan,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,37.0,1,"Brown pear, banana and gooey cherimoya aromas show in this blend of 36% Marsanne, 33% Roussanne, 25% Chardonnay and 6% Viognier. A beeswax element comes through on the palate, but the treacly, tropical flavors predominate. A decent acidity keeps it all in check."
Tyrus Evan,Syrah,88.0,36.0,1,"An unusual blend of Syrah, Merlot, Grenache and Cinsault, this wine offers fruit-forward aromas of raspberry and plum that lead to plump fruit flavors, with lightly astringent tannins providing support."
Underground Wine Project,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,32.0,2,"Vanilla, coconut and baking-spice aromas are out in front of dark fruit. The cranberry and cherry flavors show vibrancy, with fruit and barrel flavors lingering on the long finish."
Underground Wine Project,Red Blend,88.33,27.33,3,"This blend of 50% Mourvèdre, 38% Syrah and 12% Grenache is fairly light on the nose, showing smoked beef, soy and black-plum paste. The flavors are also quite restrained, with leather, blackberry, fennel and wild-mint elements."
Underground Wine Project,Sangiovese,88.0,11.75,4,"A flinty aroma, racy texture and delicate apple and white-peach flavors make this light-bodied wine seem agile like a dancer. It has great balance and a welcome refreshing quality."
Unum,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,45.0,1,"Unusual for a brut style, this wine has a pale salmon color. It tastes fresh, dry and appetizing. Light cherry and peach notes are lifted by a crisp texture and fine effervescence."
Uphill Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,28.0,1,"Dried herbs and coconut flakes provide an intriguing entry into this medium-bodied wine. Dotted with Asian spice and soy, the fruit is more savory than sweet."
Uphill Vineyards,Primitivo,89.0,25.5,2,"This blend of Merlot and Mourvèdre melds fruit from the Kestrel View and Olsen Vineyards. Bursting with mixed plum and cherry flavors, it's accented by a spice note and a streak of nougat."
Upland Estates,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,45.0,1,"Made in the rich, ripe, over-the-top style that winemaker Mark McNeilly uses for his own Mark Ryan Viogniers, this is a superconcentrated wine with more than a passing resemblance to limoncello. Along with that comes notes of Key lime, candied pineapple and a bit of alcoholic heat. Some will find it excellent, others a little too extravagant."
Upland Estates,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,30.67,3,"Thick in chocolate and blackberry jam-like goodness, this is a smooth, lush dessert wine that just begs to be poured over vanilla ice cream, its mocha-like finish akin to having a flat white cup of coffee. Cabernet Sauvignon Brandy was added to up the alcohol to a Port-like wine."
Upland Estates,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,28.0,1,"Thick and rich, with a menthol-like streak in the background, this 89% Zin is complemented by a wealth of mixed blacks, from Alicante Bouschet to Trousseau Noir. It opens with a bouquet of fresh, brambly blackberry, raspberry and sage, reaching a powerful conclusion of brown sugar and spice, staying structured atop soft, sizable tannins. Drink now through 2020."
Upper Five,Grenache,90.0,16.0,1,"Made in a deliciously oaky style, this smells like melted butter and toasted baguette, tastes like ripe pears drizzled with crème anglaise and feels almost sweet. The toasted oak component adds a touch of bitterness to balance the richness, and it all works beautifully for this approach."
Upper Five,Red Blend,85.0,32.0,1,"Aromas of buttered toast and flavors like peach and pear juice may sound a little mismatched, but they come together nicely in this full-bodied, oak-aged style of wine. The secondary toast character helps to wrap the fruitiness in a firm texture that carries all that complexity into the finish."
Upsidedown,Red Blend,85.0,25.0,2,"A 100% varietal wine, this offers a depth of earthy mushroom and forest, especially on the nose, before expansive waves of juicy raspberry and blackberry take over on the palate. Enjoyable now, it reveals a touch of dried herb and violet as it progresses in the glass."
Upsidedown,Rosé,90.0,18.0,1,"Leather and cigar box rise to the fore of this smoky wine, accented in coconut, black pepper and cedar. Dusty on the palate, it hails from a Calistoga-based vineyard site, prime location for the variety. It becomes more intense in black pepper and brambly blackberry and plum as it finishes, lean enough to invite more sips."
Uptick Vineyards,Chardonnay,85.5,30.0,2,"A booming but expertly balanced wine, this blend of 54% Syrah, 18% Petite Sirah, 18% Zinfandel and 10% Grenache shows aromas of black currant, black olive, black cherry, sweet woody spice and powdered hot cocoa. Elegant mocha and cappuccino notes thrive on the palate, which is brightened by penetrating acidity. It boasts perfectly polished tannins and ripe fig flavors, with a flash of dark chocolate on the finish."
Uptick Vineyards,Pinot Noir,85.5,49.0,2,"Robert Mondavi winemaker Genevieve Janssens makes this wine, a small-production solo project that's worth seeking. The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind."
Uptick Vineyards,Rosé,88.0,22.0,1,"This bottling from the San Francisco-based producer is about as Burgundian as California gets. Aromas of honeydew rinds, Meyer lemon pith and honeysuckle meet with briny chalk, chiseled marble and a touch of almond warmth on the nose. The extremely fresh, clean and chalky palate shows stunning texture as well as rounded lemon blossom, sea salt and the faintest butter flavor."
Uptick Vineyards,Sparkling Blend,87.0,25.0,1,"This blend of Quinta del Mar and Drum Canyon vineyards makes for a very powerful and attention-demanding wine. Sultry aromas of roasted red cherry and caramelized berry meet with well-integrated clove and allspice on the potent nose. The palate explodes with ripe but acid-cut blackberry and raspberry syrup flavors, with thyme, star anise and more dark spices rounding out the power."
Uptick Vineyards,Syrah,89.33,42.0,3,"This is a show-stopping blend of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Petit Verdot and 9% Malbec by veteran winemaker Kevin Willenborg. A deep shade of mauve, the wine coats the glass and unleashes intense, lavish aromas of cassis, fig paste, mint and tarragon. It's as soft as it looks on the palate, where baked black cherry, roast beef, turned earth and lilac flavors ride luxurious yet firmly structured tannins."
Urban Legend,Tempranillo,87.0,25.0,1,"This marks the debut of consulting winemaker Matthew Courtney's take on the estate site. It dazzles in complex notes of exotic Asian spice, lavender and crushed rock, while focused acidity provides a context of substance and depth."
Urban Legend,Teroldego,87.0,24.0,1,"With a persistence of lightly-toasted oak, this youthful wine offers intense luxury. A gritty, stony texture complements its delicious aspects of lemon rind and anise. Green apple, ocean spray and an underlying streak of dried herb provide additional complexity and length."
Ursa,Petite Sirah,85.0,22.0,1,"This is an interesting and very unique bottling of 50% Tocai Friuliano and 50% Arneis, showing Asian pear, gardenia, honeysuckle and a bit of citrus pith on the nose. The palate is rather oily, but that texture is cut by flavors of Meyer lemon peel."
Uvaggio,Charbono,90.0,24.0,1,"This wine opens in a curious mix of cucumber and mint, herbal and inviting in its unexpected charms. Tart cherry, raspberry and black tea contribute further flavor atop a light texture of still-developing concentration and ripe fruit."
Uvaggio,Moscato,91.25,15.5,4,"Only occasionally produced, this reserve-level wine is a bit of a mystery in this new vintage. It's tart and shy, its black fruit laced with assertive acidity and its finish excessively astringent."
Uvaggio,Moscato Giallo,94.0,16.0,1,"Wood smoke and charcoal aromas lead to flavors like cola, steak sauce and cherries in this dramatic, Rhône-style wine blended from notoriously meaty Mourvèdre plus Grenache and Syrah. A touch of sweetness and light tannins complete the picture of this wine made by a longtime Rhône variety specialist."
Uvaggio,Primitivo,90.0,18.0,3,"One of the producer's signature varieties, this impresses in its nutty gamy overview that recalls the sensations and smells of an Italian deli. Rich red fruit makes for a juicy core built around substantial tannins that become supple on the palate. The finish is about black pepper."
Uvaggio,Red Blend,88.0,36.0,1,"Named for brothers Richard and Don Lorenzi's mom, whose favorite color was pink, this Merlot-based rosé tastes like a grapefruit sprinkled with sugar, light and perfectly drinkable."
Uvaggio,Vermentino,92.0,20.0,1,"Yeasty and noticeably sweet, with frothing bubbles. Nice package; simple flavors."
Uvaggio,White Blend,90.0,22.67,3,"Full, fleshy and flavorful, this blend of the three estate vineyards offers pretty fruit flavors of strawberry and Bing cherry. It carries a whiff of white pepper, along with luscious, orange-tinged acidity."
Uvaggio,Zinfandel,91.5,24.0,2,"From a dry-farmed vineyard and treated to wild yeast and minimal new French oak, this Petite is chewy in leathery tannins, a definite crowd pleaser for Petite fans. Blackberries, coffee and pepper commingle impressively."
V. Sattui,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,85.0,1,"This interesting rosé mixes 78% Pinot Noir with 22% Pinot Gris. It's a pale copper with a hint of rose, and the nose carries suggestions of rose petals as well as strawberries. It's tart and medium-bodied, with some citrus snap to the acids."
V. Sattui,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.2,69.6,5,"This blend of 32% Syrah, 16% Grenache, 14% Petit Verdot, 12% Cabernet Franc, 12% Alicante Bouschet, 7% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Petite Sirah truly sings, as the name implies. A strong boysenberry pie aroma is lifted by purple flower scents on the nose, and the palate's lush black cherry, vanilla and mocha spice flavors are reminiscent of a dessert wine without being sweet."
V. Sattui,Chardonnay,89.0,44.25,4,"The dynamic nose of this bottling from a longtime ranching family in Monterey County pops with black raspberry, candied pomegranate and rose petal aromas. Fresh red fruit as well as darker baked raspberry flavors show on the palate, which is lifted by white pepper touches."
V. Sattui,G-S-M,90.0,36.67,3,"Grown in a south-facing site on limestone soil a mile east of Carmel Valley Village, this wine is dark and silky in the glass, with thick but not overripe blueberry and elderberry aromas, enhanced with sarsaparilla, smoked beef and crushed walnut notes. The palate is lush but vibrant with acidity, blending dark berry flavors with toasted oak, earth and cocoa spice."
V. Sattui,Merlot,91.0,45.0,1,"From Josh Jensen's 4.4-acre vineyard, this bottling offers black plum and mulberry aromas laced with crushed gravel and lavender notes. There is a powerful minty character to the palate, which helps enliven the hearty ripe cranberry and hibiscus elements. A thought-provoking and earthy wine."
V. Sattui,Pinot Noir,90.0,55.0,1,"Fleshy, dense and bright with cassis and vanilla notes, this 100% varietal estate wine is lovely and elegantly restrained, showing compact oak and firm tannin. Raspberry, tobacco and cedar round out the nuanced flavors that open over time."
V. Sattui,Red Blend,87.5,56.5,2,"This excellent blend of 70% Cabernet Franc, 25% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon shows caramelized black cherry, mint chocolate chip and a bit of smoke on the dense nose. The palate's soft mouthfeel is held up by firm tannins that last deep into the finish, presenting rich cherry juice flavors, along with caramel, milk chocolate and pleasant oak character."
V. Sattui,Riesling,89.33,29.67,3,"Candied lemon peel, Asian pear and marzipan hints show on the slightly oxidative nose of this bottling from Jim Clendenen. Ripe apple and pear flavors mark the palate, along with a warm toast component, but a Meyer lemon tang and bitter orange accents cut the richness."
V. Sattui,Rosato,87.0,23.0,1,"This Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre rosé is a stunning marriage of flavors and textures. Salmon in color, it invites with apricot, peach and Meyer lemon fruit, zesty acidity underlying its flavor, complexity and length."
V. Sattui,Sangiovese,90.0,26.0,1,"This bottling is a testament to how fascinating Pinot Noir can grow after just a few years in the cellar. It shows kirsch, juniper, gingerbread and chai spice on the elegant, layered nose. The palate offers a compelling curry-like spice alongside crushed kalamata olive, eucalyptus, bay leaf and cedar flavors."
V. Sattui,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,35.0,1,"Creamy yet not overly viscous, this wine finds a nice balance between fruit and juicy acidity, showing off well-crafted apricot, green apple and nut notes. Light bodied and totally fresh, it gains layers of citrus as it evolves in the glass."
V. Sattui,Sparkling Blend,88.0,35.0,1,"Jim Clendenen's winery has sat in the middle of Bien Nacido for decades, so it is no wonder he nails the vineyard's expression with this bottling, beginning with flinty and woody aromas that accent an orange custard creaminess on the nose. The palate also shows cedar-like oak, followed by waves of brioche, preserved lemon and orange marmalade flavors."
V. Sattui,Sémillon,88.0,26.5,2,"A blend from Jim Clendenen's own Le Bon Climat Vineyard and the Bien Nacido Vineyard where his winery is located, this bottling shows candied red cherry, star anise, fennel and sagebrush on the earthy but fruity nose. The palate combines fresh thyme and other wild herbs with tart Montmorency cherry—bold flavors wrapped in a delicate package."
V. Sattui,Zinfandel,89.6,41.4,5,"From the producer's best barrels and best blocks of grapes, this wine delivers goodness from start to finish. It leads with oak, honey and apple notes while its lush texture of balanced acidity and generous fruit brings along rocky minerality."
VGS,Red Blend,89.0,65.0,2,"Juicy cherry and cardamom flavors give this wine approachability as well as complexity, all within a smooth, fleshy texture. Full bodied and integrated, it's spicy and deliciously aromatic, with fresh garden-like accents of rose and lavender."
VGS Chateau Potelle,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,110.0,1,"Lush and lovely fruits highlight this wine. White peaches, lemon curd, sweet pineapple, quince and a dash of honey all combine gracefully, with a nice kick of fresh acidity. A light touch with new French oak (20%) adds a hint of vanilla and Key-lime pie to the finish. On the second day, it's just as good, if not even better."
VGS Chateau Potelle,Rosé,85.5,40.0,2,"A tremendous rendition of the variety from an appellation not particularly associated with it, this wine is deftly etched with notes of black licorice, leather and earth. Explosive tannins underscore its core of juicy blackberry and smoke flavors, while the finish is sticky and somewhat feral."
VGS Chateau Potelle,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,40.0,1,"Paix Sur Terre manages to translate the heat and sunshine of Paso Robles into a rich and savory but not overripe wine. Quite dark in the glass, it shows blackberry, black plum, roast beef, black pepper and soy notes on the nose. The palate is dense and creamy, with dark chocolate, roasted blackberry, vanilla and caramel flavors."
VGS Chateau Potelle,Zinfandel,91.0,70.0,1,"This wine's Honeycrisp apple and Applejacks cereal scents lead the nose before bold layers of luxurious texture confirm its complexity and overall appeal on the palate. Densely packed with flavor, it also shows plenty of structure to support its powerful range."
VML,Chardonnay,86.0,36.0,1,"Only one barrel of this Paul Hobbs-consulted bottling was produced, and that extreme focus made for a powerful and rich though not overripe result. Concentrated blackberry and violet aromas are cut by crushed gravel and cedar spice notes. Leather, tobacco, rose petal and black pepper accents spice up its black fig flavors on the hearty palate, which is structured with fine-grained tannins."
VML,Pinot Noir,89.25,41.0,4,"Very light in appearance, this sprightly bottling offers tart yet warm aromas of wild cherry, cranberry, sweet oregano, sandalwood and wet earth. Pomegranate, strawberry, slate and cedar notes show on the palate, which showcases ripeness in a restrained fashion. Drink now–2035."
VML,Sparkling Blend,88.0,50.0,1,"Winemaker Matt Crafton embraces the winery's longstanding tradition of elegant Napa Valley Cabernet in this estate wine—a beautiful expression of exotic, savory characteristics wrapped in a seamless texture. Tomato leaf, meat and soy notes underscore deep layers of black pepper, black cherry and cassis, with grippy, dense tannins. Enjoy 2023–2033."
Va Piano,Cabernet Franc,90.0,24.0,1,"This limited cuvée is essentially an Elton vineyard reserve, given extra (80%) new oak from selected blocks. Juicy black cherry and dark chocolate flavors combine, with lively acidity underscoring the moderately long finish."
Va Piano,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.33,54.33,3,"This single-block bottling, though tasty, is a less complete wine than the Cuvée. Here the bright raspberry fruit is tight and constrained a bit, with an abundance of tart acids. Just a light hint of chocolate comes up in the finish."
Va Piano,Chardonnay,89.0,40.0,1,"Brawny and tasty at the same time, this combines oak, vanilla and cherry aromas with very full body, ripe and broad boysenberry flavors and firm tannins. A slightly hot finish echoes the spicy oak notes. The texture is firm and tannic, making it a good counterpoint to rich food."
Va Piano,Red Blend,89.5,35.5,2,"Watermelon, strawberry and pie-cherry fruit flavors showcase a light and quite pretty rosé. Bone-dry despite the very low alcohol, it's backed with crisp acidity, a dash of minerality, and a finishing whiff of cocoa powder."
Va Piano,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,15.0,1,"Dark, inky and smoky on the nose, this estate-grown Cab is supple and medium bodied, offering bursts of juicy dark plum and berry on the palate. The oak is well-integrated and unobtrusive."
Va Piano,Syrah,92.0,60.33,12,"This is the winery's reserve, a lot and barrel selection. Nicely layered, it rolls through strawberry, raspberry, light chocolate and sandalwood, tosses in a hint of cola, and smooths out through a medium-long finish. Nothing is heavy-handed, though in this excellent vintage a bit more concentration would be welcome."
Va Piano Bruno's Blend VII,Red Blend,88.0,20.0,1,"This is a blend of five different Dundee Hills sites, and as is often the case in Oregon, delivers more accessible and complete flavors than some of the winery's individual vineyard-designated wines. It's herbal and spicy, with strong scents of tomato leaf and root beer. The fruit is tart and clean, and the wine comes out swinging, but then it falls away in the back end, adding just a lick of vanilla as a sweet coda."
Val du Vino,Barbera,88.0,28.0,1,"A very tight, tart and tannic Pinot Noir, almost impossible to open up despite hours of breathing. Acidic and unyielding, the rating is a compromise between what it is currently showing and what it hints at if you probe deeply enough."
Valdez,Zinfandel,93.0,45.0,1,"Off-dry with a candied orange character, this is indeed a mélange, including portions of seven different white wine grapes. It's an interesting wine, though might prove a bit challenging to match to food. Perhaps a curry?"
Valley View,Cabernet Franc,86.0,28.0,1,"Yes, that is the correct spelling, as shown on the wine's label. A blend of 10% Merlot, 56% Syrah, and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is dark, plum-colored and dusty with scents of plum and prune. Soft and moving quickly into midlife, it drinks like an older wine, with soft tannins and a hint of supple leather."
Valley View,Cabernet Sauvignon,82.0,24.0,1,"Syrupy and dense, this is a burly wine, soft but powerful, that keeps coming back to the theme of blackberry syrup. Velvety tannins buoy the midpoint, before it finishes in a burst of intense ripeness."
Valley View,Chardonnay,87.5,18.5,2,"There's an intensity of spicy cardamom and dried herb in this wine, otherwise layered in soft, refreshingly dry elements of cranberry and rhubarb. Darker hued than many of its counterparts, it retains a tannic grip to the finish."
Valley View,Malbec,87.0,26.0,1,"This Coda displays fresh and bright raspberry fruit. The acids come with a crisp snap, and there's an overall juiciness that makes it especially quaffable."
Valley View,Merlot,86.33,23.33,3,"This workhorse vineyard supplies grapes to a wide variety of wines across the entire Ste. Michelle portfolio, but the vineyard-designated wines are much more limited, and they're often the best of show. As the alcohol reaches 15.5%, this selection is sappy, dense and a bit warm. There's plenty of fruit flavor and concentration, but it's difficult to pair such a blockbuster with food."
Valley View,Pinot Gris,86.0,12.0,1,"Quite yellow in color, nearing orange, this oxidative-style wine shows quinine, walnuts and preserved lemons on the very concentrated, oily nose. The texture is sticky, with flavors of seared lemons and orange oil, yet it retains a lime-skin liveliness. It's quite an interesting bottling for fans of the style."
Valley View,Red Blend,85.0,10.0,1,"Edelzwicker is an Alsatian term meaning noble blend, and is applied to any blend of white wine grapes. Here, it is Gewurztraminer, Pinot Gris and Riesling, capturing the floral aromatics and lightly oily mouthfeel of the former, along with the citrus and pear flavors from the latter two components. All in all it's an aromatic, floral, broadly flavorful and distinctive white wine."
Valley View,Sauvignon Blanc,88.5,24.0,2,"Spicy berry, chocolate and bitter greens are in play, though slightly muted. The components smooth out and surf into a broad, easygoing finish. Drink up."
Valley View,Syrah,85.5,25.5,4,"Pretty scents and flavors of bright cherry fruit come up quickly, with enough concentration to batten down a medium-long finish. A light hint of sweat or animal comes up also."
Valley View,Tempranillo,86.38,24.25,8,"Richly ripe in black cherry and chocolate, this is a blend of Merlot, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel and Petit Verdot. Generous tannins give way to a soft, smooth mouthfeel and a burst of blackberry and leather, finishing in spicy cinnamon and black pepper."
Valley View,Viognier,86.17,20.33,6,"From 100% Charbono, this offers hints of raspberry, cherry and orange on the nose, amid dense cherry and strawberry flavors that are concentrated and yet doesn't overwhelm the acidity. Medium body and weight make it a nice option for sipping and at the table."
Valley View,Zinfandel,85.0,24.0,1,"Unoaked, and instead fermented for 10 months in both stainless steel and concrete egg, this white remains light-bodied and crisp, touched by aromas of honeysuckle and refreshing flavors of pear and quince."
Van Duzer,Chardonnay,87.0,40.0,1,"Sanguine and velvety, this richly derived wine made from one clone of Pinot Noir is tannic in black cherry, cinnamon and tar, with a lean, mid-length finish."
Van Duzer,Pinot Gris,86.0,16.0,1,"Aromas of ripe grapes and vanilla make for a lush, inviting nose on this fruit-forward bottling of 49.5% Sangiovese, 49.5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Malbec. The juicy palate shows blackberries and black cherries as well as licorice and dark chocolate, with strong tannins giving textural balance."
Van Duzer,Pinot Noir,85.4,51.0,5,"Blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Syrah, RTW is somewhat classical in its black olive and dried herb, yet also rich and concentrated, with tannic bite and a taste of clove. It finishes like vanilla cola."
Van Duzer,Rosé,86.0,20.0,1,"This blend of 64% Roussanne, 24% Viognier and 12% Grenache Blanc from White Hawk, Camp 4 and Zaca Mesa vineyards begins with an oily nose of dried apricots, dried apples, smoke and intriguing pecan and macadamia nuttiness. The palate is crisp and more restrained, offering honey, pears, dried mango and a woody, white mushroom-like earthiness."
Van Ruiten,Zinfandel,87.0,17.0,1,"Rich but not overly tropical on the nose, this bottling shows buttered nectarine and a touch of honeydew on the nose. The palate is expertly wound up, with bright tangerine, ripe melon and creamy cherimoya, all reined in by a wet cement-like texture."
Vanderbilt,Cabernet Franc,88.0,27.0,1,"This is a well-rounded rosé that is bound to disappear quickly from the table, with aromas of strawberry, bubble gum and peach riding a rainy-day springtime freshness on the nose. The palate explodes with acidity and textural grip, carrying both ripeness to satisfy New World fans and the deft tactile experience of Old World selections."
Vanderbilt,Merlot,88.0,27.0,1,"This is an impressive wine from a new producer. It's aromatically expressive in notes of ripe apple, star fruit and pear, with lemon-pith accents. The melon and citrus flavors are rounded, fresh and clean, offering a great balance of acidity."
Varozza,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,80.0,1,"This wine is impressively full-bodied, layered and concentrated in rich fruit—a mix of dark cherry, raspberry and toasty oak that finds life in buoyant, freshly supportive acidity and a light reckoning of spice."
Varozza,Petite Sirah,90.0,50.0,1,"Buttercream, sweet butter, marmalade, baking spice, brown sugar and sea salt converge on the nose of this bottling, named after the Foley family's Texas ranches. Sea salt, vanilla, lemon peel and frozen-butter flavors show on the sip, which is fatter in the midpalate but cut by the savory saltiness."
Vasco Urbano,Grenache,88.0,42.0,1,"This wine comes from a new project from winemaker Melissa Burr (Stoller Estate), focusing on old-vine vineyards. This bottling comes from vines planted in 1968. The aromas are light, with notes of cherry, cigar box, dried leaf and earth. The flavors are cranberry tart and mouthwatering, showing an exquisite sense of balance, with a lingering finish."
Vasco Urbano,Mourvèdre,86.0,42.0,1,"Powerful oaky elements meet very ripe and concentrated fruit flavors in this deeply colored, bold and full-bodied wine. Charcoal, wood smoke and clove aromas are followed by blackberry jam and black-cherry flavors, while light, smoky and peppery nuances weave through them. While the first whiff is oaky, everything comes together well on the palate and finish."
Vasco Urbano,Petite Sirah,92.0,40.0,2,"This blend of 42% Petit Verdot, 36% Sangiovese and 22% Merlot shows strawberry, light caramel and expressive baking-spice aromas on the nose. A powerful burst of acidity starts the palate, which combines red currant and purple-flower flavors into a very interesting and lively wine."
Vasco Urbano,Rhône-style Red Blend,89.5,36.0,2,"Although it's just a guess, it seems clear that Snoqualmie was the loser in 2004, when so many small wineries were helped out by Chateau Ste. Michelle, which provided them grapes during a bad freeze year. Snoqualmie probably should not have made a reserve under the circumstances, as this falls well short of recent efforts. It's a light and simple wine, with thin candy cherry flavors and herbal streaks."
Vasco Urbano,Syrah,90.0,42.0,1,"The straightforward Cabernet fruit is immersed in new oak, so the dominant flavors of smoke, toast, chocolate and espresso all seem to emanate from the barrel aging. Otherwise it is a simple and perfectly pleasant, no-frills red."
Vellum,Merlot-Cabernet,92.0,75.0,1,"Extremely seductive aromas of caramel, toasted oak, beach campfire, blackberry, black cherry and thin mint cookies welcome the nose to this bottling. The palate is equally complex and inviting, with milk chocolate, cherry pie, smoked pork and dried oregano flavors, tongue-tantalizing all around."
Vellum,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,85.0,1,"Light in color this wine features gorgeous acidity and a lining of fresh, vibrant red cherry, adorned completely by a pretty rose-petal bouquet. Though gentle in color and body, the texture moves along, providing plenty of body to keep the wine freshly alive."
Vellum,Petit Verdot,85.0,75.0,1,"Equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc (40% each) with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this Stillwater Creek Vineyard wine has aromas of graphite, fresh herbs, dark coffee and cherry. It has palate-coating, layered chocolate and cherry flavors plus abundant vanilla accents, coalescing on the finish and lingering."
Vellum,Red Blend,88.0,85.0,1,"Made from 84% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Syrah, this up-front wine offers aromas of herbs, dried cherry and woodspice. The dark fruit flavors are rich, layered and focused, with the tannins tightly wound, seeming to need more time in the cellar to come into their own."
Vellum,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,85.0,38.0,1,"Mourvèdre (81%) makes up the majority of this blend with Grenache (12%) and Syrah filling it out. It leans into savory notes, with aromas of sage, dried herbs, white pepper and mineral. The flavors are plush and palate-coating, bringing a slightly tacky feel that softens over time. It will be best after 2019."
Velocity,Red Blend,89.0,22.33,3,"Bright, citrusy yellow, this wine conveys a nutty, creamy custard and marshmallow component to the nose. Fuller-bodied in substance and style, it nonetheless remains stony and steely on the palate, finishing with a twist of ginger and dried herb. It will be a fine fit with food."
Velocity Wine Cellars,Red Blend,85.0,25.0,1,"A pleasant rose-petal pink in color, this wine by regional sparkling veteran Norm Yost shows red-grapefruit pulp and skin, lime spritz and a shred of bubble gum on the nose, playing both on hedonism and restraint. It's extremely refreshing once sipped, with more lime and pink grapefruit zest."
Venge,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.2,91.0,5,"Compelling aromas of rose and lavender mark this fairly full-bodied wine, giving it a lift on the nose and palate. Raspberry and black licorice take over the taste, concentrating flavor and intensity toward the lengthy, earthy finish."
Venge,Chardonnay,92.5,39.0,2,"A taste of sarsaparilla and fresh strawberry hulls combine in this soft, velvety and well-structured wine, the bouquet floral in rose petals and earthy dew. Medium to light bodied, it's a lovely sipping wine that will also pair well with food."
Venge,Merlot,96.0,68.0,1,"This is winemaker Ross Cobb's own family project, from extremely cool sites along the Sonoma Coast, including the family's own Coastlands vineyard. Here, with Rice-Spivak, he skirts the edge of ripeness, producing a light, bright wine that's at first hard to penetrate. Faint notes of tart cherry and pomegranate weave through like a fog, a seasoning of allspice on the finish."
Venge,Pinot Noir,90.5,58.5,2,"Blended with 4% Viognier and 1% Grenache, this fragrant offering displays aromas of fresh flowers, herbs, green olive, huckleberry and smoked meat. The palate is ripe and fruit-forward, a bit balled up in the middle right now but showing a pleasing sense of purity with length to match. Give it time to come into its own."
Venge,Red Blend,92.0,38.0,1,"This wine is Cabernet Franc and Merlot with just a smidgeon (4%) of Cabernet Sauvignon blended in. It provides aromas of earth, high-toned dried herbs, licorice, black cherry and crushed granite. The dark fruit flavors are densely packed, surrounded by firms tannins. Drink after 2020."
Ventana,Pinot Noir,86.0,32.0,1,"This wine is a joy to drink with its aromas and flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, herbs and cherry. The opulently styled flavors are rich but well balanced, with chewy tannins backing it all up. It's irresistible."
Ventana,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.67,33.67,3,"Acidic on the nose, like a cider, this late-harvest wine made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc retains 130 g/L residual sugar, and is rounded and plush. Appropriately sweet, it is completely balanced, tasting purely of baked pear, finding a hint of nutmeg on the lengthy finish."
Ventana,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,22.0,1,"Fruity and forward, Nefarious Cellars has its first estate-grown Malbec. It's loaded with cherry fruit and darker notes of smoke, tar and chocolate. Give it plenty of breathing time and it opens up gracefully."
Venteux,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,68.0,1,"Opens aromatically exhibiting lemon cheesecake, then delves into the rightful amount of apple and pear, finishing with a hearty helping of vanilla and caramel. Del Arroyo remains a source to watch in Livermore, especially for Chardonnay."
Venus,Zinfandel,85.0,22.0,1,"Occasio, which has made a nice Fume Blanc for a couple of vintages now, is giving the world this, its first Chardonnay, a true to its French-oak-fermented style that's quite citrus-laden, tart, lean and mean and yet voluptuous, with its barrel age showing, and toasty on the finish."
Veranda Beach,Red Blend,87.0,29.0,1,"Black as night and leathery, this is a generously savory, 100% Syrah that's well put together in structured tannins and chewy texture. Let it breathe and the range of smoked meats it'll go with are endless, matching the similar taste of grilled, gamey meat in the wine."
Vercingetorix VX,Pinot Noir,87.83,28.83,6,"A blend of 58% Pinot Noir and 42% Chardonnay, this light copper-colored wine is über aromatic with notes of passion fruit, guava and strawberry. As sweet as the aromas smell, the palate drinks bone dry with abundant brioche flavors, exquisite balance, and a long, lingering finish. Sourced from Celilo Vineyard, this is a hugely impressive wine."
Vercingetorix VX,White Blend,86.0,11.0,2,"For the first time, this release of Buty's Rediviva, from estate vineyards in the Rocks region of Walla Walla, includes a bit of Mourvèdre. The pretty fruit flavors of strawberry preserves, blueberry and black cherry carry both a mineral underpinning and a whiff of the barnyard in the nose. The aging in mostly neutral puncheons and barrels adds just a hint of baking spices."
Verdad,Albariño,92.0,25.0,1,"Coconut macaroon and smoky leather stand out most in this burly, bombastic and beyond full-bodied wine, which drinks ripe and hot."
Vermeil,Cabernet Blend,90.0,48.0,1,"New American oak cradled this wine, which includes 12% Petite Sirah. A strong aroma of root beer or Dr. Pepper wraps itself around smoky tar and toast, with a grippyness on the leathery finish that falls a touch flat."
Vermeil,Cabernet Franc,86.0,70.0,1,"This wine presents itself full-bodied and big in style, with an inkling of red plum and cherry fighting for attention against a tide of rounded concentration and darker, smokier tinges of cigar and chocolate."
Vermeil,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.67,121.67,3,"Somewhat subdued white flower, lime and peach aromas are followed by medium-sweet stone-fruit flavors. It goes down easy."
Vermeil,Chardonnay,93.0,42.0,1,"This wine has an unusually rich gold color, aromas like ripe pear, vanilla and nutmeg, and similar pastry and baking spice flavors plus that core of pear. A creamy texture and soft finish round it out nicely."
Vermeil,Red Blend,90.0,100.0,1,"This tiny production is marked by strong aromas of barbecue smoke and campfire, before unfurling an unfussy, soft and full-bodied burst of red fruit."
Vermeil,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,30.0,1,"This wine has an intensity of strawberry that permeates thoughout, riding atop a distinct earthiness that becomes slightly sour on the finish. Medium bodied, its aromatics are all roses."
Vermeil,Tinta Madeira,89.0,45.0,1,"Two thirds Chardonnay, and one third a Viognier/Roussanne blend, this young wine has a definitely spritzy mouthfeel and a yeasty finish. The fruit flavors are fresh and lively, suggesting lemon and pineapple, with finishing hints of honeycomb."
Verse & Chorus,Red Blend,87.5,22.0,2,"Though aged in just 40% new French oak, the barrel notes of mocha and roasted coffee bean take up much of the stage with dark fruit and herbs fighting for attention. The flavors are ripe and lush but seem a bit clipped."
Verse & Chorus,Sauvignon Blanc,85.0,15.0,1,"From a selection of clones planted in Goldridge sandy loam soils, this is a dark and savory Pinot Noir. Ripe and oaked, it presents a balanced combination of cherry fruit flavor and soda spice."
Verve,Pinot Noir,87.0,30.0,1,"Moderately aromatic, this offers notes of pepper, spice and plum along with high-toned vanilla accents. It's medium bodied, with sweet blackberry flavors and dry, astringent tannins."
Vezer Family Vineyard,Red Blend,85.0,39.0,1,"Intensely oaky, this Carneros Pinot is brooding in ripe plum fruit and straightforwardly layered with approachable fruit flavor and mellowing tannins. Enjoy now."
Via Giusti,Pinot Noir,90.0,48.5,2,"Tasty and toasty, young and compact, this is a wine to cellar for a few more years at least. The bright fruit flavors run from berry to Bing cherry, not as dark as in some years, but vibrant and crisp. The new oak is not yet fully integrated, so give it some extra bottle age for optimal enjoyment."
Via Giusti,Vermentino,88.0,28.0,1,"Cedarville's ode to Priorat, this is a mix of 45% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. The three get along swimmingly, amusingly mixing into a triad of dark blackberry, dark licorice and dark chocolate. The rich texture is on the mark, and the wine provides just the right heft for any spicy, brawny meal."
Viader,Red Blend,93.5,130.0,2,"Herbal and dill infuse the light flavors, and the tannins feel as if they've been softened up in the winemaking process. The wine does a quick fade."
Victor Vineyards,Chardonnay,86.0,15.0,1,"A sharp, herbal blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, showing hints of resin in its aromas. The pale red fruit flavors are tart, light, and simple."
Victor Vineyards,Red Blend,89.0,14.0,1,"The blend is 40% Syrah and 20% each Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese. It's difficult to find a focus here. Scents of breakfast tea and a lingering sour-candy fruit flavor are dominant, with fairly astringent tannins closing it down. Drink up."
Victor Vineyards,Zinfandel,87.0,15.0,1,"With a weaker nose compared to other Zins, this offers faint hints of pressed strawberries and black olives. It's also light and watery on the palate, which makes for easy although not very distinctive drinking, with flavors of cranberry and plums more prevalent."
Vidon Vineyard,Pinot Noir,91.11,52.58,19,"Intended as a take on Rioja, this is noticeably volatile, dusty and loaded with chocolaty barrel flavors. Cocoa and raspberry are in the mix, but it's chocolate that runs away with the finish."
Vie Winery,Grenache,90.0,39.0,2,"Focused aromas of blackberry, elderberry and black currant show on the nose of this blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Syrah and 4% Cabernet Franc, which also offers hints of leather, nettle and caramel on the nose. It's lively on the palate, with black raspberry, rose petals and violets, framed by a vibrant acidity and worthy structure."
Vie Winery,Rosé,86.0,18.0,1,"Winderlea is the most limited and most expensive of the winery's single vineyard series. This vintage remains tight and compact—a youthful purple in color, with fruit flavors of plum and sour cherry. Subtle layers unfold as it breathes, adding citrus peel, minerality and a touch of malt as well."
Vie Winery,Syrah,90.2,43.2,5,"Broad aromas of black cherry and black-tea spice make for a dark and full nose, which is enhanced by strong soil components of turned loam and gravel. Dark boysenberry and tart plum skins show on the palate along with more tea spice, making for a very full sipping experience."
Viento,Barbera,87.0,24.0,1,"Brooding aromas of crushed rock, mineral, black olive, soot, cracked black pepper, charcuterie and dried herb lead to fresh, focused flavors that are flavorful but remain light on their feet. It shows a bit more tannic heft than this area often shows along with great length on the meaty finish."
Viento,Gewürztraminer,94.0,45.0,1,"Alluring aromas of moist earth, cassis bud, olive, nori, pipe tobacco, charcoal, funk and mineral give way to lithe fruit and savory flavors with an ultra soft feel. The texture is absolutely dazzling."
Viento,Gewürztraminer-Riesling,91.0,60.0,1,"This lightly bodied, elegant wine is subtle and crisp—a study in white pepper and leather that's both complex and tightly layered. Cool climate to its core, it shows floral aromas and flavors of rose petal and lavender as hints of rhubarb and tart cherry make their way onto the quiet palate."
Viento,Grüner Veltliner,89.0,18.0,1,"From the estate's original vines planted in 1978, this exceptional wine envelops the palate with layers of richness not often found in Pinot Gris. It's lush and seductive, with hints of honeycomb, brown butter, toasted peanut and dried apricot. The flavors persist, and lovely details keep it interesting through the finish."
Viento,Pinot Noir,88.0,30.0,1,"From a vineyard perched 1,700 feet above the Monterey Bay, this wine by brewer-turned-vintner John Benedetti is both very light yet incredibly flavorful. Rusty raspberry and strawberry aromas meet with dill, thyme and white pepper on the nose, while the palate offers soft red cherry and gently sprinkled herbs throughout."
Viento,Riesling,90.75,15.5,4,"Made in even smaller amounts than the vintage before it, this combines 90% Petite Sirah with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from old head-pruned vines. The winemakers succeeded in coaxing fruity raspberry and blackberry around a fully brazen acidity that explodes on the palate. Softly textured, the wine is incredibly fragrant and inviting in white pepper."
Viento,Rosé,86.0,14.0,2,"This well-crafted reserve boasts a solid core of blueberry and black cherry fruit, thickly accented with dark chocolate notes. Produced from heritage (Calera, Swan and Mt. Eden) clones, it's textural and dense, with dark char, espresso and black licorice flavors."
Viento,Sangiovese,88.0,17.0,2,This was half whole cluster-fermented and neatly incorporates hints of earth and bark into its tart cranberry and pie cherry core. Its verticality and tannic power suggest it will age quite nicely through the late 2020s.
Viento,Viognier,88.0,16.0,1,"There are multiple Freedom Hill selections in this winery's 2015 lineup, but the Pommard clone bottling expresses more of the site's brambly wildness along with its lusciously fruity raspberry flavors. Texture and length elevates it above much of the competition."
Viento,White Blend,89.0,14.0,2,"From a cool site in the Sebastopol Hills greatly influenced by the cooling fog and winds of the Petaluma Gap, this wine is velvety in texture, with a gritty tannic backbone. Cedar, eucalyptus and savory tea complement an array of juicy red fruit and blueberry, with structure and balance at the wine's core."
Vigil,Zinfandel,86.0,15.0,2,"From the last remaining block of a vineyard planted in 1968 by Oregon pioneer Dick Erath that's yielding less than 1.5 tons per acre, this is loaded with rose petal and cherry blossom aromas. Delicate and graceful, it offers subtle raspberry, blackberry and cherry fruit. The finish is exceptional, long and complex, with hints of coffee and caramel. Give this wine your full attention and enjoy how long it lingers."
Villa Creek,Syrah,94.0,55.0,1,"Exotic aromas of cranberry, plum, sandalwood, myrrh and lavender makes for an elegant entry to this bottling by the winemaking team of Steve Fennell and Laura Roach. Layered flavors of tart cherry and pomegranate are laced throughout by dried herbs, while the tannic structure is firm but not obtrusive. Drink 2018–2034."
Villa Mt. Eden,Zinfandel,90.0,21.0,1,"Wonderful purity is on display in this mineral-driven, tart, racy and expressive Syrah from the estate vineyard. The bright and tangy berry flavors may strike some palates as a bit on the sour side, but there is more than enough ripeness here for most. This is succulent and classy."
Villa San Juliette,Alicante Bouschet,91.0,30.0,1,"Made from three-quarters Merlot and one-eighth each Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre, this new version of The Spinner seems to be surfing a wave of spicy berry that's about to smash into a wall of chocolate. But it never crashes, instead it just sails on through a gorgeous midpalate into a lingering finish that features caramel and mocha highlights."
Villa San Juliette,Cabernet Franc,87.5,45.5,2,"Highlighted by forward, pretty, cherry-candy flavor, this is an appealing vintage for D2—DeLille's second-label Bordeaux-style blend. Accented with integrated notes of herb, nougat and milk chocolate, this finishes with a streak of minerality that provides a bit of gravitas."
Villa San Juliette,Grenache,91.5,32.0,2,"The blend changes annually—here it's two thirds Merlot and one third Cabernet Sauvignon—but the wine remains accessible and spicy, a mix of currant and berry, pepper and cedar."
Villa San Juliette,Pinot Gris,85.0,22.0,1,"This is 70% Cabernet, 20% Merlot. Dark, tight and loaded with fruits, this balanced, juicy wine has it all—elegance, length, finesse and mouth appeal. Blackberry and black cherry fruits dominate, with light suggestions of pretty leaf, tobacco, earth and some iron."
Villa San Juliette,Red Blend,92.0,42.5,2,"Really fragrant, with this vineyard's near-perfect mix of fruit, rock and barrel. This is restrained, elegant but powerful—raspberry fruit over crushed rock, with vertical structure, an immaculate mouthfeel, and a finish that continues to resonate for minutes after the swallow."
Villa San Juliette,Rosé,87.0,20.0,1,"The fruit is forward and lush, the grapes nicely blended and complementary, yielding a complex, mouthfilling wine with a riot of tropical, stone and citrus fruit flavors. There is a trace of new oak and a lingering finish that brings in vanilla, butter and coconut."
Villa Toscano,Barbera,84.5,17.0,2,"Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon share top billing here, in a sleek, stylish, beautifully polished wine loaded with blackberries, black cherries and cassis. Firm and textural, it layers in subtle spices, dark chocolate, espresso and moist loam, all in delicate balance. The firmness of the tannins and tightness of the layering suggests that laying it down for a few years will only improve it further."
Villa Toscano,Zinfandel,82.33,24.0,3,"A real success, this intensely spicy Syrah loads in mouth-softening flavors of buttermilk, cocoa and cinnamon. Lots of toast and coffee, with a creamy, textural mouthfeel. The rich, ripe, almost sweet cherry fruit is like a mouthful of fresh pie."
Viluko,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.33,40.0,3,"A nutty, leesy wine that takes those positive attributes to the limit, resulting in a mix of flavors that range from peanut brittle to lemon custard. The delicate melon and citrus fruit ends up getting a little overwhelmed."
Viluko,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,27.0,2,"The blend is 70% Pinot Gris and 30% Viognier. The Gris provides the fruit base, with pear/apple flavors; the Viognier adds some light lemon and citrus blossom accents. This is a big wine, bone dry."
Vin Roc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,49.0,1,"A stunning and unusual white wine out of Lodi made by Jim Moore, with tremendous aromatics of honeysuckle and melon and a genius balancing between sweetness and acidity. Grapes—technically Moscato Giallo—were harvested from the Bella Vigna Vineyard fully ripe but at low brix, allowing this bottling to maintain a very low 12% alcohol level. An amazing deal for a wine that jumps out of the glass, all bright and starry eyed."
Vin du Lac,Cabernet Franc,84.5,37.5,2,"The counterpart to Lynn's Blend, named for a co-proprietor, Anisya's showcases the lighter side of the Sonoma Coast in its exuberance of red cherry, orange and strawberry. Textured, it features bright acidity and layers of freshness, teased in black tea and wild truffle."
Vin du Lac,Cabernet Sauvignon,82.0,25.0,1,"Grande is one of the most historic vineyards in southern Napa, still presided over by the lovely Dorothy Rossi, whose father planted the oldest vines here in 1920, the year she was born. The location, farming and age work together to offer aromas of dusty leather satchel and a richness of juicy blackberry and cranberry. Powerfully elegant and integrated, it evolves in the glass in a myriad of ways, surprising with every sip."
Vin du Lac,Chardonnay,87.0,25.0,1,"A vibrant and lithe expression of cool-climate Syrah, this bottling shows crushed peppercorns, beef char, thyme, coffee syrup, potpourri and blackberry juice on the nose. The crisp palate is lively with peppery spice, with a base of tart elderberry juice layered with cooked lamb and fresh rosemary. It finishes with a healthy sense of pencil shavings."
Vin du Lac,Pinot Gris,86.25,19.0,4,"Once again this vineyard delivers irresistibly bright refined flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit—primary, concentrated and immaculately fresh. There's a touch of mocha from the new barrels, and impressive length. As with all of Trisaetum's single vineyard Pinots, this is built for cellaring, and should drink best after another couple of years in bottle. Drink 2018–2028, perhaps beyond."
Vin du Lac,Red Blend,84.0,25.0,1,"The best Grace to date, the wonderfully fruity entry bounces along, offering a punch bowl full of spicy cherries, with extensive highlights. Sniff and taste streaks of clove, coffee, fresh earth and mushroom—all clean and harmonious. This may be drunk immediately with enjoyment, or set aside as your special occasion wine with a decade or more of ageability."
Vin du Lac,Riesling,86.0,20.0,3,"This wine begins a bit wound-up and restrained on the nose, but then reveals waves of cassis, blackcurrant, elderberry and caramelized beef tips. The flavors are woven together perfectly, showing deep blueberry syrup, dark-chocolate chips, brighter plums, lovely lilacs and a touch of tar. It's deep, dark and complex."
Vin du Lac,Sauvignon Blanc,86.2,17.8,5,"A barrel-fermented white Pinot Noir, this is bursting with broad, creamy flavors of ripe caramel-dipped apples and fresh pear. It might be mistaken for Chardonnay, except for the extra weight that carries through the lengthy finish. Though it's tempting to describe white Pinot Noirs as sparkling wines without the sparkle, this is much more interesting, and one of the rare examples that defines both a style and a standard for the rest."
Vin du Lac,Syrah,84.33,31.0,3,"This is one of the most exciting wines of the vintage for this label, a blend of 68% Bien Nacido and 32% from its sister vineyard, Solomon Hills. It shows Meyer lemon pith, chalk, pencil lead, grapefruit pith and a slight touch of yogurt on the nose. The chalk-driven, tingling-with-acidity palate opens onto brine-laced flavors of yellow grapefruit pith and expertly restrained pineapple and peach."
Vin du Lac,Viognier-Roussanne,83.0,15.0,1,"Bliss Block lies within the property's Quail Hill Vineyard and is the coolest two acres on the estate. Spicy acidity and dark earth support a full-bodied, oaky imprint of complexity and structure, dotted in savory cranberry and black tea."
VinRoc,Cabernet Blend,88.0,49.0,2,"This is a truly beautiful wine, a blend of two estate vineyards, Quail Hill and Susanna's. Richly layered and concentrated in its still-vibrant youth, it's also texturally complex and compelling in its teases of ginger and honey, taking on more succulent notions of apple and a flinty element as it opens."
Vina Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.5,52.5,2,"From a vineyard located close to the coast of Aptos, this bottling shows dewy chaparral aromas on the nose, as well as light cinnamon, nutmeg and smashed graphite, with a dense pomegranate-hibiscus core. It is tightly wound on the sip, with cranberry, raspberry, rose petal and rose-hip flavors. The texture and tension are impressive, and will unleash continued intrigue from 2018 to 2033."
Vina Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,24.5,4,"This is a spicy, fully plush and complete wine, integrated in oak and tannin with a strength of black-cherry compote that gives an extra edge. The length and texture are impressive, showcasing the power of the vineyard in a ripe, even vintage, and some deft winemaking as well."
Vina Robles,Petit Verdot,89.0,29.0,2,"This complex white comes from cuttings procured in 2004 from one of the oldest surviving vineyards of this variety, thought to have originated in the Loire Valley, then replanted by the producer onto older rootstock. Lemony acidity meets light, bright floral intrigue around hints of peach, grapefruit and lime, remaining velvety smooth and balanced."
Vina Robles,Petite Sirah,89.0,44.0,1,"Cofermented with 5% Viognier, this perfumed wine brings aromas of green olive, stems, potpourri, blue fruit and moist earth. The palate is chock-full of layered boysenberry and earth flavors, earthshaking in their intensity, with a mouthfeel that only heightens the interest."
Vina Robles,Red Blend,88.0,17.0,1,"Minty earth tones frame this wine from a dramatic vineyard perched high amid the redwoods and shale soils of this mountainous region that impart forest underbrush, dried lilac and olallieberry aromas. The dark blackberry fruit flavors on the palate are enhanced by marjoram, dark clove, crushed fennel and Christmas spices."
Vina Robles,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,16.0,1,"A blend of fruit from Northridge Vineyard on the Wahluke Slope and Powerline Vineyard in the Walla Walla Valley, this pale colored wine delivers vibrant, complex aromas of strawberry, brown stems, fresh flowers, green olive, smoked meat and moist earth. The cranberry and smoked meat flavors are soft and sumptuous, leading to an extended fruit and savory note finish. It's all about elegance but the purity is dazzling."
Vina Robles,White Blend,89.0,16.0,2,"This is an exceptional example of this variety, with aromas of fresh herb, violets, orange peel and black fruit. The dark-fruit flavors are rich and layered, showing an exquisite sense of balance along with great length."
Vinas Zurinaga,Pinot Noir,89.0,70.0,1,"This is the winery's first attempt at a reserve-level Rhône-style wine. A blend of Mourvèdre (51%), Cinsault (27%), Grenache (18%) and Counoise, it leads with fragrant aromas of crushed flowers, thyme, smoke, white pepper and boysenberry. The mouthfeel is seamless and the flavors rich, along with exquisite balance and exceptional length."
Vincent Price,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,62.0,1,"Clear, light color reveals the elegance at the core of this coastal wine. It reigns in ripeness without sacrificing flavor or complexity. Stemmy, earthy overtones meet a vibrantly spicy bite of cherry and white pepper. The silky texture compels one to want more."
Vincent Vineyards,Cabernet Franc,88.0,65.0,1,"Very dark and dramatic, this delicious wine combines great balance with power. It has exotic fruit flavors and a light spiciness. The smooth, sculpted mouthfeel comes with rich, almost thick tannins that seem to extend the finish. This will find its full potential sometime after 2020."
Vincent Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,68.0,2,"This is the producer's first vintage from Hudson, one of the most sought-after sites in the appellation, and one not widely planted to the variety. Light and lush with a velvety ripeness, this special wine shines in pomegranate, earthy truffle and a turn of smoked meat. Robust, it maintains balance amidst its brawn."
Vincent Vineyards,Sauvignon Blanc,92.0,25.0,1,"This big, full-bodied wine is unabashedly bold and brassy, from the aromas of toasted oak to the buttery flavors and vanilla finish. While dry, it has a rich texture and the near-sweetness of ripe varietal flavors."
Vindemia,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,80.0,40.0,1,"The aromas of blue fruit and herb seem light considering the warmth of the vintage. The palate brings a mouthful of fruit flavors, bringing a pleasing sense of freshness. It all seems a bit dialed back."
Vindemia,Cabernet Franc,86.0,88.0,1,"A pale and delicate version of this entry-level Pinot, its fruit is barely there, just hinting at rhubarb and watermelon. Some earth and stem flavors come through as well."
Vindemia,White Blend,89.0,24.0,1,"This is smooth, round and Zinfandel-like in its fulsome toasty character and abundant chocolate and black fruit flavors. As it's aged in 100% new French oak for 17 months, the oak looms large and lasts a long time."
Vine Cliff,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.67,126.67,3,"This has a sweet charm to it, with a rich lemon flavor. This would be fine as a light dessert wine with lemon cake."
Vine Cliff,Chardonnay,89.67,61.67,3,"Densely packed with black fruit and barrel toast, this wine is mouth-puckering with tannin and power. A lightly perceptible dried herb note weaves through its dark texture."
Vinedos Aurora,Red Blend,88.0,39.0,1,"Bold, meaty and softly simple, this robustly full-bodied wine is redolent of mocha and brown sugar. Its ripely sweet blackberry fruit is cut with savory black-olive notes."
Vineyard 36,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,85.0,1,"Light in color, this wine offers aromas of herb, red currant, graphite, raspberry and barrel spice. The fruit and barrel flavors are elegantly styled, playing off each other through the finish."
Vino,Sangiovese,86.0,12.0,1,"Cherry, raspberry compote, anise, vanilla, wood spice and medicine-cabinet aromas are followed by lighter styled fruit and savory flavors, with the tannins bringing some grip."
Vino La Monarcha,Pinot Noir,87.0,18.0,1,"Pure Mourvèdre remains a rare bird of a wine, even in grape-happy Washington State. This is a good example, with flavors that carry the leafy, herbal character often found in Carmenère and the bright, mineral-laced fruit of southern French wines. It's not a big wine, and the vines from which the grapes are sourced are still young, but it's well made and will hold your interest."
Vino Noceto,Red Blend,89.0,18.0,1,"A smoky, oaky nose opens to reveal pretty fruit, accented with rose petals. Strawberries and hard cherry candy flavors lead smoothly into a finish laden with milk chocolate and, unusually, hints of rosemary."
Vino Noceto,Sangiovese,90.0,29.0,2,"The fruit and herb flavors in this medium-bodied wine have good depth, conveying black cherries, raspberries and a light touch of thyme. It offers an appropriate savory element as well as a core of ripe grape flavors. Tasting solid but smooth, it is well made and unfussy."
Vino Vargas,Cabernet Sauvignon,84.0,24.0,1,"A Cab-based wine with 20% Merlot, this has juicy blackberry and currant to soften the overreaching tannic profile. Blessed in cedar and tobacco, this also presents a strong showing of dried herb. The fruit leans black and blue, from blueberry to black plum, a nod to the Merlot."
Vino Vargas,Chardonnay,84.0,24.0,1,"Aromas of orange peel, blue fruit, flowers and dried herbs are appealing and direct. The flavors and feel are elegant, showing freshness and acidity."
Vino Vargas,Merlot,87.5,24.0,2,"An appealing pale salmon color, this blend of 50% Cinsault, 28% Grenache and 22% Syrah displays aromas of strawberry, cherry Jolly Rancher and melon. Reflective of the warmth of the vintage, it's fruitier than recent vintages but it's still hard to put down."
Vino Vargas,Pinot Noir,87.0,45.0,2,"Billed as a Cabernet lover's Merlot, this wine offers robustness as well as a soft, angular quality that provides a certain level of elegance. Oak, green olive and sage mark its bouquet, followed by flavors of red currant and dried herb."
Vino Vargas,Rosé,83.0,27.0,1,"Raspberry and vanilla introduce this wine, made from a selection of vines 21 to 130 years old, with some planted in 1882. Lusty and lush layers of cinnamon and cola accent the fruit and provide complexity, the tannins resolved and thick."
Vintage Cowboy,Merlot,87.0,20.0,1,"Merlot remains a challenge for most Oregon producers who attempt it. This does not rise past the impression of light and grapey soda flavors, with some stiff earthy tannins."
Vintage Cowboy,Zinfandel,87.0,23.0,1,"Flinty and austere in tone, this reserve-tier wine is lemony and tart, with grapefruit flavors heartily enveloped in oak."
Vintager,Chardonnay,86.0,20.0,1,"This dry rosé is 100% Merlot, fermented in stainless steel. It's rather flat in both mouthfeel and flavor, with nondescript one-dimensional red fruit."
Vinum,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.67,18.33,3,"This wine shows finesse, driven by its seamless mix of citrus, melon, peach and pear fruits. Immediately delicious, it actually improves by the second day, showing its perfect acid-to-fruit balance. Give it a light chill—not too much—and it's a perfect autumnal sipper."
Vinum,Chardonnay,88.0,13.0,1,"Lively and lush, this is lip-smacking good juice. It's dense with apple, peach and melon fruit flavors that penetrate deeply, buoyed by juicy acidity. Pinot Gris this tasty should be enjoyed lightly chilled, while it is in the first bloom of its freshness."
Vinum,G-S-M,88.0,18.0,1,"This vineyard is best known for its Merlot but this Cabernet keeps pace. It brings a mixture of fruit and barrel aromas of vanilla, blackberry, coffee, licorice and herbs. Flavors are sweet and rich, with coffee lingering on the finish."
Vinum,Pinot Noir,86.0,13.0,1,"From a field blend interplanted with Viognier, which accounts for 2% of the wine, this dense, thick expression of this burly variety exudes velvety blueberry and blackberry around almost impenetrable tannins, the leathery roughness still being sorted out. Cellar through 2020 to coax out its finer flavors of mocha and meat."
Vinum,Rhône-style Red Blend,87.0,18.0,3,"Careful winemaking balances the fruit and oak perfectly in this lovely, medium-weight wine. It's polished and steely, with just-ripe apple and pear fruit, braced with racy, lemony acidity and a streak of minerality. It was fermented in 100% French oak, one sixth new."
Vinum,White Blend,88.0,18.0,3,"A rare, arresting varietal bottling of Cinsault—forget for a moment that it's also vineyard designated. It boasts intoxicating notes of fresh boysenberries, cherries, herbs, and peppery spice. It's silky and fruit filled with an incredible sense of freshness and purity that is nothing short of dazzling."
Vinum Cellars,Cabernet Franc,88.0,30.0,2,"A unique blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Mourvedre, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, and Sangiovese with notes of sassafras, cocoa, and dried herbs. It's focused and concentrated with structured, firm tannins crafted to go the distance. Give it some time in the cellar or a long drawn out meal to see it at its best."
Vinum Cellars,White Blend,88.5,19.5,2,"A fine vintage of Bill Easton's Cabernet Franc, from the Monarch Mine Vineyard, where he typically sources tremendous Syrah and Barbera, this wine is still developing and will do nicely with time. For now it shows perfumed herbal restraint, subtle spice and a twist of oaky coffee on the finish. A savory wine that would pair well with filet mignon à point."
Vinum Ferus,Pinot Noir,90.33,22.67,3,"Nearly equal parts Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also features good handfuls of Petit Verdot, Merlot and Cabernet Franc that offer soft, velvety flavors of blackberry and blueberry. Lightly oaked, the tannins are grippy while the wine generates an herbal undertone on the nose."
Virage,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.0,85.0,1,"Honeysuckle, mineral, honey and botrytis aromas lead the way. This drinks off dry with exceptionally well-balanced acidity that carries through the lingering finish."
Virage,Cabernet Franc,87.5,26.0,2,"Pear and white flower aromas are light, while the palate is full of sweet brown sugar and honey flavors that persist on the finish. It's sweet, but well balanced, with ample acidity and a clean finish."
Virginia Dare,Pinot Noir,85.0,25.0,2,"Cocoa, plum and vanilla aromas are followed by creamy-feeling blue-fruit flavors that display a mixture of fruit and barrel. The barrel influence is heavy, but it's delicious all the same."
Vista Hills,Pinot Gris,88.83,18.33,6,"This wine was aged 15 months sur lee in all-new French oak. The barrel aromas and flavors are in the lead, with notes of vanilla, butterscotch and spice followed by pear. It's creamy in feel but with an elegant styling."
Vista Hills,Pinot Noir,88.46,42.17,24,"A blend of 97% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Petit Verdot, this wine speaks to power, offering juicy, velvety texture around brawny components of leather, coffee and black plum. Concentrated and intense, it needs time to open in the glass before pairing with thick cuts of meat."
Vista Hills,Rosé,87.5,20.0,2,"Pineapple appears first on the nose and palate, followed by high-toned acidity and a back-up of lemon and lime. Medium bodied, the wine remains light and crisp throughout, finishing in a swirl of lemon zest and grapefruit pith."
Viszlay Vineyards,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.5,49.0,2,"This blend of Roussanne, Viognier, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc has a serious line of minerality apparent on the nose as well as pear blossom, pineapple-guava skin and a dairy tang. The palate clings to Meyer lemon pith and Greek yogurt flavors."
Viszlay Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,98.0,2,"Though labeled as a red blend, at 94% this could be a varietally labeled Merlot and it drinks like it. Aromas of cocoa, raspberry and spice box are followed by plump, soft chocolate and raspberry flavors accented by tart acids that hold the balance through the finish."
Viszlay Vineyards,Chardonnay,86.0,48.0,1,"Flinty, mineral-like aromas and flavors lend a complex personality to this compelling, medium-bodied wine. The palate is crisp, dry and citrus-driven, inviting another sip and begging for some fresh-shucked oysters."
Viszlay Vineyards,Malbec,87.0,98.0,2,"This bottling changes dramatically from year to year; here it is 100% Riesling rather than a blended white. A little sweet and a little sweaty, it falls flat on the palate, leaving you wondering why a wine barely a year old is already entering old age. Drink up."
Viszlay Vineyards,Petite Sirah,90.0,42.0,2,"This wine is more a Bordeaux Blanc with Sémillon (15%) playing a prominent role. It leads with aromas of custard, barrel spices, pear and fig followed by lighter-styled fruit flavors. The concentration isn't all there but the balance of what is is spot-on."
Viszlay Vineyards,Pinot Noir,85.0,68.0,1,"Aromas of pear, honeysuckle, cream and peach rise up from the glass. This is lightly creamy in feel, with elegantly styled but well-balanced fruit flavors that linger."
Viszlay Vineyards,Zinfandel,87.0,42.0,1,"Here is a big, friendly wine with plenty of sweet, spicy oak in the aromas and flavors, and an easygoing texture that's not too tannic or acidic. It shows smoky, almost sweet, toasted oak aromas and basically melts in your mouth like milk chocolate, which would make a good pairing."
Vital,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88.0,25.0,1,"Aromas of Bing cherry, herbs, earth and exotic spices tussle a bit on this blend of Sangiovese (55%), Cabernet Sauvignon (27%), Merlot and Syrah from Seven Hills and Stillwater Creek vineyards. Flavors are generous yet reserved, with a seamless feel and zippy acids stitching it together, followed by bitters on the finish."
Vital,Sangiovese,85.0,18.0,2,"This is the first offering of this wine where Cabernet Franc (37%) takes the lead, blended with Cabernet Sauvignon (27%), Merlot (23%), Malbec (7%) and Petit Verdot. It's drinking young now, with wound-up herbs, cherry, chocolate and cranberry flavors backed by firm, gripping tannins. It will be best after 2021."
Vite Vecchio,Zinfandel,93.0,25.0,1,"Leathery and somewhat green, this wine has yet to find its balance, combining 95% Cabernet Sauvignon with 3% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. It veers between heavy, ripe tension and an underripe underbelly, finishing unsure."
Voila!,Red Blend,87.0,22.0,1,"A closed, tight and grippy wine, this has a big tannic structure that supports a landscape of cassis, cranberry and ripe plum, along with clove and tobacco. Fuller-bodied in style, it finishes smooth and lean."
Volatus,Red Blend,89.67,25.0,3,"Rather aggressive tannins and distinctly earthy scents of tomato leaf and vegetation characterize this modest effort. It's chewy and herbal, with little indication of fruit ripeness."
Volatus,Rhône-style White Blend,89.0,25.0,1,"The aromas seem quite dried out, with notes of blackberry bramble and fruit leather. The flavors also seem considerably more evolved than its age. It's a big miss."
Volker Eisele Family Estate,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,75.0,3,"Richly fruity and semisweet, this medium-bodied wine smells like cotton candy and tastes like pear syrup. Smooth in texture and mouth-filling in concentration, it finishes on lingering sweetness."
Volker Eisele Family Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.67,78.33,3,There's just a trace of color on this wine. Light aromas of citrus and herb are followed by dry-fruit flavors. The concentration seems quite dilute.
Volker Eisele Family Estate,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,90.5,25.0,2,"Vibrant aromas of pineapple, flowers, peach and lychee lead to an palate that leans sweeter than off dry. Stone-fruit flavors linger on the finish."
Von Holt,Chardonnay,92.0,35.0,1,"Plummy with a sour hint of leather, this light-bodied wine, is somewhat flat in structure and finishes lean."
Von Holt,Pinot Noir,88.5,38.0,2,This medium-bodied wine opens with a squeeze of acidity and follows through with simple and straightforward citrus flavors.
Von Holt,Syrah,90.0,30.0,1,"This wine is a very pale peach color. Aromas of strawberry candy, watermelon and citrus peel lead to light dry-fruit flavors. The concentration seems a bit lacking."
Von Strasser,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,102.0,5,"Alpha is a new offering from Market Vineyards, and boosts the flavor meter past the winery's excellent, value-priced Benchmark Merlot. Tightly-structured and showing a barrel-heavy mix of dark, toasted flavors, this complex effort brings lead pencil, clove, charred meat and black fruits into play. Enjoy it with your thick grilled steak, or tuck it away until 2020–2022."
Von Strasser,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.88,80.0,8,"From one of Marin's coolest and best-farmed vineyard sites, this offering is intoxicatingly pretty in violets and herbs, and fleshy in the mouth with gorgeous texture. Layered, structured and dancing in acidity, this is a Marin Pinot not to miss."
Von Strasser,Grüner Veltliner,90.0,35.0,1,"Nine years in tirage gives this 75% Chardonnay/25% Pinot Noir sparkler a deeply golden hue as well as aged aromas of hazelnut, caramelized apple and fermenting stone fruit. Apple juice dominates the oxidized flavor profile, with heavy duty yeast and lemon pith along for the curious, intriguing ride."
Von Strasser,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,22.0,1,This intriguing wine conveys aromas of coffee bean and barrel spices. The palate is restrained with a low-alcohol feel and coffee flavors. The concentration isn't all there but it still piques the interest.
Vortex,Red Blend,85.67,23.67,3,"Lightly aromatic, it offers notes of pencil shavings, dark fruit, coffee and pepper. It's medium bodied with a lower alcohol feel and abundant coffee flavors backed by gritty tannins."
Vortex,Tempranillo,86.0,25.0,1,"A whiff of volatility distracts a bit from an otherwise enjoyable wine that has notes of butterscotch, tapioca and spice. The palate is medium bodied with sweet tropical fruit flavors. Tasted twice with consistent notes."
W.H. Smith,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,125.0,1,"From a series of single-clone, single-block bottlings, this is a sharp-toned, slightly volatile wine with bright, tight, cherry fruit flavors. It's a good starting point for a blend, but feels incomplete on its own."
W.H. Smith,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.5,63.0,2,"This is refreshing and quite dry, with fragrant fruit cocktail aromas and subtle, spare flavors that suggest it would be a great oyster wine. Made from 51% Sémillon along with other grapes it's interesting enough to serve during dinner as well as an apéritif."
W.H. Smith,Pinot Noir,92.5,54.0,2,"This wine is unquestionably about power and punch, not subtlety. Superripe fruit flavors of kirsch and dark, toasty, coffee liqueur coat the palate. It's flavorful, but not a trace of varietal character remains."
W.T. Vintners,Chenin Blanc,90.0,20.0,2,"There is 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay in this sparkling Brut. Golden-apple in color, it offers flavors and aromas that follow suit, rich in ripe apple, hazelnut and chestnut with a layering of natural sweetness on the finish."
W.T. Vintners,Grüner Veltliner,88.67,19.33,3,"This blend of 64% Marsanne and 36% Roussanne is one-dimensional, and it tastes a bit sour."
W.T. Vintners,Mourvèdre,91.0,49.0,1,"In a vintage that produced the finest overall lineup of Cayuse wines to date, it may seem a little nit-picky to score some higher and some lower. But the En Chamberlin deserves first place again. Brilliant aromatics of smoked meat, bacon fat and otherworldly roasted accents seduce instantly. Once on the palate, the silky, balanced, near-perfect mix of umami and fruit, plus licorice, cassis, coffee liqueur and black tea notes suggest it's as decadent as it is delicious."
W.T. Vintners,Pinot Noir,91.0,20.0,1,"Dense and concentrated, this has thick, almost jammy blue and purple fruits, with a peppery highlight and an undercurrent of sweet grain. The palate is tight, featuring layers of cassis, ink, anise, coffee and iodine, with an earthy salinity that runs through the finish. The Armada is perhaps a bit less fruity and more austere than the other 2009 Cayuse Syrahs, but is every inch their equal."
W.T. Vintners,Red Blend,90.5,35.0,2,"Using grapes sourced entirely from the En Chamberlin Vineyard, this pure Cabernet is deep, dark, focused and tight, with firm but velvety tannins and a perfect mix of cassis, coffee and earth. Even more than previous years, this vintage displays astonishing depth and power. Flavors of Serrano ham and other cured meats, plus a delicate saltiness and minerality keep the flavors developing onto  the long, fascinating finish."
W.T. Vintners,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,32.0,1,"The Camaspelo blend is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot, and it shows a riot of juicy cranberry, raspberry, blueberry and black cherry flavors in a rambunctious display of power. Full, round and balanced, it offers hints of cedar, earth and coffee that extend onto the lush, complex, age-worthy finish."
W.T. Vintners,Syrah,90.62,40.88,8,"A unique take on this variety that saw no new oak, this wine reveals aromas of cigar box, dried herb and dark fruit. The palate brings a fine sense of purity and detail to the raspberry and cherry flavors, trailing ever so slightly toward the finish."
WCP,Zinfandel,91.0,34.0,1,"Generous herb, citrus and tropical-fruit aromas are followed by a full-bodied palate chock full of kiwi and other broad tropical-fruit flavors. It's unabashed in its appeal."
Wagner,Chardonnay,85.0,11.0,1,"Sourced from the crest of Catherine's block of Dineen Vineyard, this brooding wine brings aromas of dried and fresh herbs, vanilla, orange peel and pencil lead, which need some time to unwind. The cranberry and cherry flavors bring a sense of freshness, with the tannins providing some heft. It needs time to be fully appreciated."
Wagner,Gewürztraminer,86.0,15.0,2,"This rich but bracing dry wine is blended from Italian grape varieties. It has plenty of ripe plum and cherry shaded by black olive and savory herb nuances backed by moderate tannins. Unlike Noceto's other more elegant reds, this one is full bodied and ripe in flavor."
Wagner,Riesling,87.33,18.0,3,"This squat bottle comes, indeed, straight from the barrel with no filtering, and works quite well. Bright and plump purple fruits mix with vanilla and a tickling acidity on the nose. The palate shows juicy cherry fruit as well as blackberry and blueberry, with richness from vanilla and caramel. The tannins are a bit tough, but rugged in the right ways."
Wagner,Vidal Blanc,84.0,20.0,2,"A tiny bit of effervescence dissipates quickly. Classic aromas recall dried lime peel, wet cement, cut grass, sliced apples and a touch of rosemary oil. The palate holds extreme grassiness along with Anjou-pear peel, pine and thyme, reminiscent of a dewy lawn in springtime."
Wagner,Vignoles,86.5,16.5,2,"From a hillside vineyard near Moon Mountain overlooking the Sonoma Valley, this wine was blended with 5% Petite Sirah. While not as high in alcohol as some of the producer's other wines, it has a concentrated character on the palate, akin to blueberry syrup, with soft, moderate tannins and a dusty texture. Red and black cherry provide additional fruit flavor."
Wait Cellars,Cabernet Franc,86.0,28.0,1,"Honey, jasmine, salted nectarine, yellow melon and plumeria flowers pop on the nose of this bottling that indicates Roussanne may do well in Temecula. There's solid yellow-grapefruit-pith grip to the palate, a touch of tart tangerine, slate minerality and some botanical elements. It's bright and tense for an often oily, easily over-ripened grape."
Wait Cellars,Pinot Noir,92.0,33.0,2,"A unique but quite successful blend of 75% Chardonnay, 14% Viognier, 8% Roussanne and 3% Marsanne, this bottling offers light pear cream, cantaloupe and daffodil on the pretty nose. The palate shows honeydew ripeness but with plenty of restraint thanks to lime zest and clean green fruits, wiping up with a tense texture on the finish."
Walla Faces,Red Blend,87.0,28.0,1,"The aromas offer notes of char, toast and peach. The flavors are simultaneously broad and sleek in styling, with a finish that lingers."
Walla Faces,Syrah,86.0,40.0,1,"This is a complex Lodi old-vine Zinfandel with boysenberry and blackberry notes poking through layers of complexity and a touch of dusty plum. It has a strata of black licorice throughout the midpalate, with a peppery, wild herb flavor keeping it interesting. Notes of espresso and leather mark the finish, and a controlled amount of acidity keeps in balance."
Walla Walla Vintners,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,40.0,2,"This Rhône-style blend—two-thirds Roussanne, the rest divided between Marsanne and Viognier—was made using grapes sourced from the estate Destiny Ridge Vineyard. Intriguing aromas suggest clover, sweet grass and honeysuckle, while the flavors run from stone fruits into hints of light tropical fruits. It's lovely and evocative."
Walla Walla Vintners,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.44,45.78,9,"This is the best Pinot Gris yet from Jones; the grapes were sourced from the 2 Gun Vineyard in the upcoming Ancient Lakes region—a future American Viticultural Area. Leesy and creamy, it seduces with a layer of rich cream wrapped around bright orange and semitropical fruit flavors. It's full and fresh, and it lingers."
Walla Walla Vintners,Cabernet Sauvignon-Sangiovese,92.0,32.0,1,"A beauty—soft, round, bursting with cherry and raspberry fruit, blood orange, bracing acids and satiny tannins. Succulent and mouthfilling, with following notes of light chocolate, coffee and a streak of gun metal."
Walla Walla Vintners,Dolcetto,91.0,29.0,1,"Wow. An incredible (and affordable) example of what Mourvèdre can be in certain nooks and crannies of the Sierra Foothills and in certain hands. Here winemaker and owner Hank Beckmeyer has made a silk mountai wine out of a tough vintage, taking organically farmed Mourvèdre from the folks over at Cedarville (who have their own label too) and made a gorgeous, pure and rich Rhône with perfumed notes of plum, smooth spice and a good dose of earth, all easy on the palate with fresh acidity and a velvety texture. Very little sulfur was used."
Walla Walla Vintners,G-S-M,88.0,30.0,1,"Seriously deep, the weight and concentration immediately apparent, this Hyland Pinot requires extra breathing time, and probably some years in the cellar. Red and black fruits penetrate into a silky, spicy, supple core. It's a bit lower in alcohol than most of the other single vineyard Pinots from Erath, but all the more cellar-worthy."
Walla Walla Vintners,Malbec,91.0,31.0,4,"Ripe, full-bodied black cherry fruit shines here, with good tannin support. The wine is rich across the palate, with clean, focused, lingering flavors that really extend into a terrifically long finish."
Walla Walla Vintners,Red Blend,90.0,35.43,7,"This juicy and simple blend of 40% Merlot with Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon offers chewy, dense tannins and a lingering spiciness of leather and tobacco."
Walla Walla Vintners,Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,42.0,1,"A brilliant shade of pink, this bottling shows all the classic rosé aromas, from watermelon, to strawberry to bubblegum, with a touch of warm pastry as well. The palate offers a candied watermelon and cotton candy flavors, without any sweetness."
Walla Walla Vintners,Syrah,90.5,43.0,4,"Quite a bit lighter than the 2014 vintage, this wine layers buttery aromas over crisp apple and lemon flavors. It's pleasant and light in body, showing more richness than expected from its lively fruit components. Labeled as Pinot Noir, this is actually a white wine made from the dark grapes."
Wallis Family Estate,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,65.0,2,"The point of this semisweet bottling is a little unclear, but it offers a beautifully rich nose of honeysuckle, buttercream, white peach, almond paste and flint. The palate is rich, creamy and quite sweet, with peach, melon and mango flavors. Consider it as a light dessert wine or a pairing for spicy foods."
Wallis Family Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.33,101.67,3,"This salmon-hued bottling from Pinot Noir shows cantaloupe, watermelon Jolly Rancher and pink rose petal scents on the nose. The palate delivers bright acidity, presenting more watermelon flavors, a compelling texture and a gunmetal finish."
Walnut City WineWorks,Chardonnay,88.5,30.0,2,"Cabernet Sauvignon (73%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the rest filled out by Merlot (15%), Petit Verdot (8%) and Cabernet Franc. Anise, woodspice and herb aromas are at the fore, leaning a bit into the green. The palate is light and elegant, with the tannins bringing a fair amount of grittiness. It needs some food to keep them in check."
Walnut City WineWorks,Dolcetto,87.0,17.0,1,"Mouth-filling and firm in texture, this medium-bodied wine has plenty of black cherry, prune and spicy chocolate aromas and flavors. Blended from Cabernet Sauvgnon, Petite Verdot and Syrah, it has an appropriately tannic texture that melts on the finish and echoes the chocolate and spice notes."
Walnut City WineWorks,Pinot Gris,87.0,20.0,1,"This bottling is an ode to Bill Foley's Texas roots. It shows dried strawberry, rich olallieberry, baked cherry, black-cardamom cream and plum cookies on the deliciously spiced, fruit-forward nose. The palate is refreshing and fresh, with black raspberry and black-pepper flavors."
Walnut City WineWorks,Pinot Noir,88.29,33.71,7,"Delicate and retrained in aroma, this wine hails from an extreme coastal vineyard between Pismo Beach and the Edna Valley. With patience, Meyer lemon curd and scratched-lime elements emerge, and the flavors are also light, with more lemon and lime as well as Gala apple and Anjou pear flesh."
Walt,Chardonnay,92.83,50.83,6,"Move past the initial, yeasty simplicity of this wine. It's unusual, to say the least, a white wine made exclusively from this dark Bordeaux red. Skin flavors and light, lemony fruit are in play, with hints of cucumber, white peach and melon."
Walt,Pinot Noir,92.93,64.6,15,"Roughly two-thirds Cabernet Franc and the rest Gamay, this is a peppery, tartly acidic red wine. Its sharp-edged berry fruit is braced with lemony scents and acids. Tannins are drying and a bit edgy."
Walter Dacon,Red Blend,83.0,20.0,1,"This majority varietal wine contains 2% Cabernet Sauvignon, which doesn't help to soften its powerful grip of sturdy tannin and sideshow of oak. Blueberry and chocolate come to the fore slowly between meaty leather and a dusty aroma."
Walter Dacon,Syrah,89.75,34.5,4,"Made with 24% Petite Sirah, this dusty, bold and highly structured wine from an historic vineyard site is intensely concentrated and extracted, exuding rich red berry. Cinnamon and black pepper dot the lengthy finish."
Walter Scott,Pinot Blanc,89.0,18.0,1,"Clear, light and varietal, this wine ping-pongs between subtle cinnamon and Asian spice around dark cherry and earth, with a big, juicy hit of oak and intense tannin. It finishes full-figured and robustly concentrated."
Wapato Point Cellars,Pinot Noir,85.0,34.0,1,"A hearty but not overdone blend of 73% Petite Sirah, 18% Tannat and 9% Petit Verdot, this well-named wine shows asphalt, black pepper, violet and a sourish blueberry on the nose. Ripe boysenberry fruit pops on the palate, as do lavender and peppercorn. The flavors grow a tad more tart as the sip lingers."
Wapato Point Cellars,Syrah,87.0,36.0,1,"The notes of ash, cherry, and plum are faint and soft in feel but it's well priced for the quality and delivers enough tannic heft to live up to its name."
Wargin Wines,Petite Sirah,82.0,34.0,1,"A unique blend of Syrah, Barbera, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Mourvèdre all aged in neutral oak, it's a straightforward, easy drinker with sweet notes of plum, cracked pepper and tire rubber."
Wargin Wines,Pinot Gris,90.0,24.0,1,"Lightly aromatic with notes of pear, spice, and a kiss of caramel. The small amounts of Viognier (9%) and Sémillon (2%) contribute to its medium bodied, viscous feel before leading to a tart, somewhat thin finish."
Wargin Wines,Red Blend,90.0,18.0,2,"This has smooth tannins and plenty of bright fruit flavor. Made in a savory style, the finish on this wine has a leathery bite to it."
Washington Hills,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,10.0,1,"Firm, hard and tight, this offers black cherry flavors with some peach-pit phenolics. It's sharp and edgy, definitely on the herbal side, with a hint of stem."
Washington Hills,Chardonnay,88.0,10.0,1,"Despite its time in bottle, this wine has years to go before it sleeps. It still needs further integration of its substantial body of tannin and tobacco within the layers of sanguine game, pencil lead and plum. In addition, it would benefit from being enjoyed with food, preferably medium-rare steak. Drink now through 2021."
Washington Hills,Merlot,88.0,10.0,1,"This terrific wine is classically varietal, with beautifully defined flavors of cured meats, tobacco, coffee, lavender and peppercorn, all in service to ripe purple fruits. Impeccably balanced, it conveys finesse."
Washington Hills,Moscato,89.0,10.0,1,"The impressive nose on this blend offers aromas of tobacco, beef jerky, oregano, thyme, chocolate, coffee and dark earth against a blueberry-liqueur backbone. A bumping acidity unleashes flavors of plum and purple flowers on the palate, which also shows espresso and blackberry tang, carrying deep into the finish."
Washington Hills,Red Blend,83.0,9.0,1,"Scents of cinnamon and red-pepper candy come up quickly, leading into a wine with terrific purity and focus. The raspberry and cherry fruits are clean and sharp, beautifully defined and balanced. Delicious young, this wine is set to develop further complexity if well cellared. Drink now through 2030."
Washington Hills,Riesling,86.88,9.88,8,"Barrel-fermented in stainless steel and neutral oak, this aromatic wine rolls into a gorgeous palate loaded with rich fruit flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and Meyer lemon. There's a suggestion of softness to the acids, and a lick of butterscotch runs through the finish. It's a totally engaging wine."
Waterbrook,Cabernet Franc,86.0,55.0,1,"Sea salt, honeysuckle, lemon-sprayed apple and a touch of graphite dominate the nose of this tasty wine that grows only more interesting with time. Lime zest plays on the edges of the palate, though the middle shows a nectarine and yellow-pear richness. Energetic acidity tickles the tongue throughout the sip."
Waterbrook,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.5,26.0,4,"A soft, aromatic entry opens into compact cranberry and raspberry fruit. This wine is young and firm, beautifully balanced, and still showing some stiffness in the tannins. It does a clean, gentle fade, retaining its freshness all the way."
Waterbrook,Chardonnay,87.71,16.86,7,"Substantive flavors and a rich, tannic texture form a serious profile for this deeply colored, dry and full-bodied wine. It smells like raspberries, tastes deep and concentrated, and has a very firm and nicely astringent mouthfeel. Pour it with a big steak, chop or roast."
Waterbrook,Malbec,87.5,23.0,4,"Zinfandel from old vines is rarely this light and refreshing, yet still exuberant in fruit. A mix of tart cherry and just-ripe blackberry comes with a lingering edge of citrus around the cinnamon and black pepper spice. Funky earth ripples through the middle, before a subtle take on leather finishes things out."
Waterbrook,Merlot,87.6,23.4,5,"A mild undertone of funky earth and rustic leather provides intrigue and individuality to this release, one of the larger offerings by the winery. Cherry, pomegranate and cranberry all make appearances on a palate that is lush and expansively fruity, finishing in memorable minerality."
Waterbrook,Red Blend,87.0,14.6,5,"This affordable offering from a prime site within the appellation introduces itself with burly, smoky undertones and a thick skin, remaining grippy and smoky in black fruit throughout. Full bodied, it shows the warmth of the vintage and ripeness of valley floor grapes."
Waterbrook,Riesling,89.0,14.0,2,"This 100% varietal wine offers aromas of coffee, mixed berries, spice, pencil eraser and herbs. The tart fruit flavors are generous and full, leading to cranberry flavors that carry on the finish. The oak seems primary but it still brings enjoyment."
Waterbrook,Rosé,84.5,11.5,2,"From the cool-climate Beckstoffer Lake Carneros vineyard site, this wine opens in a thickness of blue and red berries, the tannins soft and integrated yet weighted by a puckering persistence to the palate. Dried herb and cedar round out the highly full-bodied, ripe finish."
Waterbrook,Sangiovese,86.0,12.2,5,Dried black cherry and a streak of cola mark a wine with decent concentration and full-bodied richness that gets better in the glass as it goes. The finish is persistent and balanced in a ripeness of fruit with freshness.
Waterbrook,Syrah,88.0,22.0,1,"This blends 61% Sauvignon Blanc, 36% Sémillon and 3% Chardonnay, opening in strong currents of honey caramel and dried apricot, with a back note of raisin. Voluptuous and nutty, it drinks big in style and personality, delivering plenty of defined flavor."
Waterbrook,Sémillon,88.0,15.0,1,"Subtlety and reserve drive this full-bodied, round-textured white Rhône-style blend. The velvety mouthfeel is almost more notable than the subdued pear, melon and butter flavors. It's a wine for lingering over, because it reveals its best stuff after time in the glass. It leads with 49% Marsanne, plus Viognier, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc."
Waterbrook,Viognier,87.0,25.0,1,"This wine captivates with its exotic aroma profile of citrus peel, mango, leather, cranberries and pepper. The acid is bright and it possesses a textured, palate-coating mouthfeel and a long finish that demands attention."
Waterbrook,White Blend,86.0,13.14,7,"This lovely vineyard-designate opens in cherry-berry cobbler, becoming luxurious and weighty on the palate while remaining juicy and expansive, too. Dusty tannins provide a structure and backbone before Tahitian vanilla marks the long finish. This wine is entirely enjoyable now but should thrive in the cellar through 2025."
Waterloo,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,42.0,1,"The pithy yet subtle focus on this wine's nose ranges from lime peel to squeezed lemon reduction to sour apple flesh. There's a hint of ripe nectarine to the palate and lots of Key lime juice, opening towards apple custard and a citrus peel bitterness, proving to be a steadily evolving and complex wine."
Waterloo,Mourvèdre,91.0,32.0,1,"This wine is 45% Cabernet Franc, 22% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 11% Malbec. It charms with alluring aromas of herbs, black licorice, cassis and coffee. The palate has a creamy, rich feel with abundant black fruit flavors and exceptional tannin integration."
Watermill,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,35.0,1,"The oak (70% new puncheons) is primary at present on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Aromas of vanilla, café au lait and woodspice are out in front of cherry and herbs. The palate shows nuance, detail and length. It needs time in the cellar to come together. Best after 2020."
Watermill,Cabernet Franc,90.5,32.0,2,"Strong impressions of bold fruit flavors partner with enchanting new oak nuances. Aromas offer cedar, tobacco and clove, while flavors resemble black cherry, currant and dark chocolate. This is robust, packed with opulent fruit and framed by a layer of fine tannins that needs time to soften. It will be best after 2020."
Watermill,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.5,42.5,2,"Splashes of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot make their way into this vineyard-designate, a well-made offering of cola and blackberry with supple tannins. Layered and complex, it's medium in weight and length, with a density of oak on the finish. Drink now through 2020."
Watermill,Malbec,88.0,32.0,1,"Coffee, herb, cherry, cocoa and barrel-spice aromas draw you into the glass. The palate brings down a velvet hammer with dense, brooding dark cherry flavors backed by tightly wound tannins. It has the stuffing to go the distance. Wait until 2021 or give it a day-long decant."
Watermill,Mourvèdre,87.0,28.0,1,"Two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Petit Verdot, Merlot, Malbec and Carménère, this brooding wine brings aromas of moist soil, herb, black tea, eucalyptus, fig and spice. It's full in feel, tart and tightly wound with bright acids and chewy tannins—a wine intended for the long haul. Enjoy after 2020."
Watermill,Petit Verdot,88.0,32.0,1,"Aromas of earth, black cherry, cedar and blackberry precede full-bodied, layered fruit flavors with a long finish. It's a delicious, no-holds-barred offering of the variety."
Watermill,Red Blend,89.0,15.0,1,"An impressive mouthfeel is the standout characteristic of this full-bodied, balanced and elegant wine. It smells and tastes subtly delicious, with restrained rather than overripe cherry and plum flavors, but the way the velvety texture of tannins and acidity surround the fruit and carry it through to the finish is remarkable. The blend holds Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah."
Watermill,Syrah,89.5,33.0,2,"Coming from a site across from Cold Creek, this wine offers notes of toast, sautéed herbs, blackberry and spice. It's rich, power packed and layered with dark fruit flavors and firm tannins—an excellent mixture of power and elegance."
Watermill,Tempranillo,87.0,36.0,1,"This mesmerizing offering has aromas of lemon curd, mineral, almond, flowers, nectarine and apple. The palate is rounded, with a lightly creamy feel while retaining a sense of vibrancy and lightness."
Waters,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.33,60.33,3,"An enticing, spicy, cedary, toasty aroma leads to generous flavors of black cherry, wood smoke and dried plum. The body is full, the texture is bold, firmly tannic and buoyed by acidity that provides grip on the palate and makes it a great match for rich proteins. Best after 2019."
Waters,Malbec,93.0,32.0,1,"The initial entry to this wine is reminiscent of cheesecake, with a decadence to the bouquet. From there, ripe pear and toasted oak combine around a tropical edge of guava and papaya, giving complexity and lushness on the palate, before a zesty, slightly tart finish confounds and invites one in for more. Cellar through 2018."
Waters,Rosé,91.5,22.5,2,"Muted on the nose, this is a spicy, somewhat austere wine, shy in red berry fruit and soft tannins. From a 1,500-foot elevation vineyard, it lacks the power of some of its competitors, yet offers a balanced, less in-your-face take on the variety."
Waters,Syrah,90.89,43.33,9,"This wine, which is named after vintner Bill Foley's grandma, is quite light in the glass, and shows a lot of florals on the nose, along with strawberry syrup and brown spice. It's a little flat on the palate, yet suggests fresh raspberries and rose petals, proving a nice light and bright sipper that wouldn't overwhelm a fish dish."
Waters,Tempranillo,93.0,28.0,1,"A blend of 83% Syrah with 17% Petite Sirah, this is a juicy wine, bursting in black plum, blackberry and gamy smoke. Low in oak imprint, it's medium bodied, approachable and easy to like, plenty tannic but not over the top."
Waters,White Blend,92.0,28.0,1,"High in acidity, this features a pleasant saltiness matched by an austerity of lemon and pear. It's a lighter, brighter style of the variety that stands out for its zestiness and slight layering of herb and ginger."
Waters Crest,Red Blend,86.0,30.0,1,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is brooding in dried sage, cedar and pencil shavings, the fruit black and ripe. Oaky and sanguine, it has a girth to it. Sprinkles of cinnamon and clove peak on the finish."
Waters Crest,White Blend,86.0,45.0,1,"This is a flavorful, smooth-textured wine drenched with grapy, jammy flavors. Ripe and concentrated, it has a lively mouthfeel due to welcome tannins and acidity. It offers a lot to like."
Wattle Creek,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,22.0,1,"Formerly the JV bottling, this is a fresh and textural Pinot Noir, with flavors of raspberry and cola intermingled. The mouthfeel is lively and clean, and the finish lightly spiced with cinnamon highlights."
Wattle Creek,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,75.0,1,"This is sharp as a knife, with peppery herbs in the foreground, a hint of anise, and plenty of crisp, green apple fruit. It's got a refreshing gin-like citrus rind character, with hints of pineapple and a lick of butter on the finish."
Wattle Creek,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,28.0,1,"This is a four-barrel selection—a blend of wines made from four different clones aged in 50% new oak. Cola and cherry-candy flavors carry hints of orange peel and pink grapefruit. It's an elegant wine, a step or two more concentrated than the winery's regular Pinot Noir, with a suggestion of earthy beet root in the finish."
Watts,Zinfandel,88.0,25.0,1,"Baked cherry and burned caramel-pie notes meet with brown spices, cranberry, smoked pork and dried anise on the shape-shifting nose of this bottling. The flavors are clean and smoky, with slightly charred cherries, roasted plums, grilled meat and an uplifting sage-eucalytpus finish."
Wautoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,48.0,1,"This is a highly satisfying estate-driven white, impressively crafted in spicy acidity and complex layers of grapefruit. Pithy in its citrus components, it goes on and on, never ceasing to unleash subtle hits of wet stone and a tiny taste of the sea."
Waxwing,Pinot Noir,90.43,38.86,7,"This is a heady and attention-stealing wine, starting from the powerful nose that shows ripe strawberries, cherries, cinnamon and Christmas spice galore. Rounded red fruits like strawberryand cranberry come with a spice rack of clove, allspice, thyme, marjoram, sagebrush and other crushed herbs."
Waxwing,Riesling,88.75,23.0,4,"From an eight-acre block of the producer's iconic estate, this is a velvety smooth, darkly colored wine, luxuriously structured to age yet deliciously appealing now. Chocolate, blackberry, currant and a leathery, smoky edge combine forcefully on the palate with length and breadth. Drink now through 2023."
Waxwing,Rosé,88.0,18.0,1,"Set within the smaller Green Valley AVA, Hallberg is 100 acres of varying aspects and weather, much of the site impacted by ocean winds and fog. The wine reflects this in its bright, citrusy acidity and earth, measured by elegant layers of orange, cranberry and strawberry. Cedar and black tea give it an exotic edge."
Waxwing,Syrah,91.8,34.8,5,"Very fresh on the nose but with an underlying savory character, this bottling from a vineyard on the extreme western edge of the appellation shows exotic aromas of lime skin, chopped lemongrass and salted lemon juice. The palate is taut with crispness and very salty, showing apple flesh, pear skin and lime-rind flavors. It's altogether well centered, cohesive and attention-grabbing."
Wayfarer,Chardonnay,95.67,80.0,3,"This is a rich and engaging blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre from one of West Paso's great vineyards. Baked black plums mix with condensed purple flowers, dried mint, turned earth and a savory, almost rugged meat quality on the nose. The palate is salty to start and thoroughly spiced with rosemary and lots of acidic zest, set against a black-plum fruit backbone."
Wayfarer,Pinot Noir,95.27,118.0,15,"Extremely dark fruit tones come from the nose of this wine, including blackberry and black cherry. It also offers touches of red fruit alongside snapped dark chocolate, licorice and a tarragon mintiness. Density and darkness consume the palate too, with blueberry fruit laced by dried basil, oregano, lavender and tar."
Weather,Pinot Noir,88.0,50.0,1,"This barrel-fermented wine drinks like a beautifully proportioned Chardonnay. It takes bright, intense fruit flavors of melon, yellow apples and green bananas, and puts a Burgundian spin on the mouthfeel with judicious acids and a touch of caramel. It's delicious, complex and should age nicely for another five to six years."
Weatherborne,Pinot Noir,92.0,50.0,1,"Dark and concentrated, this sends up complex aromas saturated with tar, asphalt, ink, steel, smoke and charred barbecue. It's a beautiful wine, tight and textural, in perfect balance, with superb depth, precision and elegance. The most contemplative of a superb 2011 Cayuse lineup, this wine above all needs your full attention."
Wedell Cellars,Chardonnay,91.5,50.0,2,"The immediate impression is of savory umami aromas pierced with pine needle and sage highlights. Red and black licorice, along with sweet cured meats, bring complexity to fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum. Toss in Provençal spices, coffee grounds and the classic Cayuse earthiness that continues through a deep, firm, beautifully defined finish. Drink now through 2030."
Wedell Cellars,Pinot Noir,90.86,77.43,7,"This glorious, evocative wine calls up a rich and sensuous catalog of scents and flavors. Black truffle, sea salt, clean earth, fungus, strawberry, liquid rocks, umami, tar...? the words pour out with each sniff and swallow. It's detailed, substantial and refined, gathering itself for a long, generous, captivating finish. Drink now through 2030."
Wedell Cellars,Syrah,94.0,70.0,1,"From an estate block planted to a mysterious suitcase clone, this is an insanely memorable and indelible Pinot. High in acidity, it discloses a touch of cedar on the back palate, richly luxurious and just aching for wild Sonoma duck adorned in a cherry reduction sauce. Cherry pit, berry, lavender and violet play on the nose and tongue, infusing the wine with a playfulness balanced by power."
Wedge Mountain,Riesling,85.0,18.0,1,"Violet blossoms and orange peel aromatics jump out, followed by scents and flavors of lamb tartare and mixed charcuterie. Cofermented with 5% Viognier, it's an elegant and beautifully proportioned wine, offering ripe purple fruits with finishing hints of baking spices and dark chocolate."
Wedge Mountain,Viognier,82.0,25.0,1,"This sensational effort comes from 20-year-old vines. It's a glorious wine; textural, generous and complex. The bright and fruity midpalate blends flavors of peach, quince, honey, tea and caramel, buoyed by juicy acidity and a touch of minerality."
Weibel Family,Sparkling Blend,83.0,12.0,4,"Crafted from estate-grown fruit—a marriage of Pommard and Swan clones—Golden Mean comes from three distinct vineyard blocks, the Pommard fermented whole-cluster. It opens with dark, ripe layers of lush cherry-vanilla, the wine concentrated and rich in oak yet balanced in acidity. On the finish is a mix of leather, licorice and wild herb. Tuck it away through 2020–2022."
Weisinger,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,46.5,2,"This is the winery's top Chardonnay, kept in bottle an extra year prior to release. Even in a challenging vintage such as 2011 it's a huge wine with astonishing concentration and power. The fruit has coiled intensity—so potent that it seems ready to burst wide open. Ripe apple and peach, olive oil, toasted almonds and plenty of new oak flavors abound. It's a jaw-dropper, and may be drunk now through 2022."
Weisinger,Chardonnay,87.0,30.0,1,"Intensely aromatic, this carries a wealth of layered flavors consistent with past vintages. Umami, sea salt, mineral and Provençal herbs comingle, with a rich component of raspberry, plum and cherry compôte. More layers appear through the finish, with orange liqueur and a whiff of tanned leather."
Weisinger,Gewürztraminer,85.0,24.0,1,"A brilliant effort, this belongs right up there with the very best New World Viogniers. White flowers, lemon curd and a lush mix of citrus aromas show immense concentration right from the start. Both precise and dense, the scents and flavors flow through into a tightly wound, mineral-soaked finish, bright with citrus and apricot fruit. The length and concentration are simply spectacular."
Weisinger,Pinot Noir,86.0,40.0,1,"From one of the few Napa Valley wineries to showcase Malbec, this wine is a testament to the virtues of that devotion. It offers rich, dreamy flavors of blueberry cobbler, blackberry and licorice, lifted acidity and plush, soft tannins, all gorgeously finished in spicy chocolate and vanilla."
Weisinger,Red Blend,83.0,42.0,1,"Densely planted and labor intensive (it is actually tilled by Belgian draft horses), the vineyard's first releases have been eagerly anticipated, and do not disappoint. Floral highlights are stacked over a swirl of umami, with subtle power and airiness. Delicate and tense, it's packed with brambly berry flavors, minerally acids and fine-grained tannins."
Weisinger,Syrah,86.25,25.0,4,"Brooding in dark cherry and earthy spice, this fully figured wine offers well-integrated oak. With a savory and powerful profile, it has a forceful grip on the palate accented by black tea, truffle and juicy vibrancy. From a mix of Dijon clones (37 and 777), some fermented whole-cluster, this is a structured, wine from a meticulously farmed coastal site."
Weisinger,Tempranillo,85.5,32.0,2,"A potpourri of exotic scents and flavors, this vineyard selection opens with scents of rose, raspberry, lavender and tea. The palate is generous and complex, mixing in nutmeg, chocolate, star anise and cola. Although it promises many years of life ahead, it's already too good to resist."
Weisinger's of Ashland,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,27.0,1,"Evelyn's is the winery's reserve bottling. From first sniff to last sip it's a magical wine, conveying the richness and complexity that Biodynamic farming can convey. Cherries, cut tobacco, iron filings and dark chocolate flavors swirl together in a lush tapestry. The texture, tension and balance are superb, and time spent in 50% new French oak puts a wisp of smoke through the engaging finish."
Weisinger's of Ashland,Cabernet Franc,84.0,25.0,1,"This vineyard was planted specifically for the No Girls project. The wine is fresh, fragrant and intensely floral, with a mix of rosewater and orange zest. Elegant, with a delicate, lacy texture, the flavors are savory and salty, braced with stiff, lightly peppery tannins. Notes of funk and mushroom come into play as it finishes gracefully and with unexpected length."
Weisinger's of Ashland,Merlot,85.0,20.0,1,"A star even among a stellar group of 2012 releases from Elk Cove, this 20-year-old vineyard really delivers the goods. Time has tempered the herbal aromatics, giving this rich, ripe effort a subtle subtext of olive and sage. Black cherry, dark chocolate and a dusty, mocha finish with a hint of habanero pepper bring this wine together beautifully. Delicious already, it should continue to improve 2025–2030."
Weisinger's of Ashland,Red Blend,83.5,18.5,2,"Though very pale in the glass, this wine holds no shortage of interest. Honey and roasted marcona almonds consume the nose, and the palate blends bright citrus, lemon curd and cinnamon, all propped up by a perfect, judicious use of oak."
Weisinger's of Ashland,Semillon-Chardonnay,84.0,15.0,1,"Sourced from the original 1965 planting, this wine demands your patience and full attention. Displaying a deep straw, slightly tawny hue, it opens with lightly spicy, nuanced threads of mint, hay, olive oil, green banana and almond. It seems almost ephemeral, but with some hours of breathing time it opens into a full-bodied, dense and compelling wine, with the extra dimensions that old vines can provide. Drink now through 2030."
Wellington,Alicante Bouschet,88.0,30.0,1,"Dark, concentrated and grippy, this is a sizable Pinot from a cool, coveted vineyard. Juicy blue and blackberry fruit dominate on the nose and palate, surrounded by exotic cedar, clove, oak and toffee, a swipe of vanilla lurking behind the front flavors. The big tannins will appreciate time in the cellar, through 2022–2024."
Wellington,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,60.0,1,"Of the four De Coelo Pinot Noirs sourced from this one special site, Arbore Sacra is the most earthy, savory and viscous. Grapes come from the Calera clone, beautifully structured and shyly subtle. In this graceful wine, expect nuanced layers of Asian spice and blackberry, with finely honed tannins and a lingering, spicy finish."
Wellington,Cabernet Franc,89.0,35.0,2,"Deep, dark and instantly compelling, this powerful wine features black cherry and cassis fruit adorned with clove, citrus, cardamom, nougat and mocha. The chewy tannins and overall tightness suggest that further cellaring will continue to improve it. Drink 2016 through 2030."
Wellington,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.25,32.5,4,"A rare gem, this Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend is sourced entirely from Red Mountain's Klipsun vineyard. Aged for 10 months in one-year-old French oak, it's a spicy wine with aromatics and flavors of botanicals such as mint and quinine. Fruit is sharp with flavors of grapefruit and white peach, and hints of toast and cracker."
Wellington,Grenache,89.0,25.0,1,"This mongrel is 50% Red Mountain Syrah, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot. Tight and tart, it has a slightly reduced, rubber ball character, and needs plenty of breathing time. Fruit flavors are raspberry and cassis, accented with sharp acids and stiff tannins."
Wellington,Marsanne,88.0,25.0,1,"This new Ausonius features a blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Cabernet Franc and 8% Malbec. At first it's rich, smoky, chocolaty and supple; moving toward a Napa style in its breadth and ripeness, but leavening that with Washington's bright acids. Pleasing hints of spice and herb are dappled in, and the wine is almost peppery as it weaves across the palate. The finish is clean and simple, leaving you wishing for just a bit more complexity."
Wellington,Meritage,88.0,60.0,1,"Bellissima Rossa is 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. The Cabernet Sauvignon is muscular and taut; blackberry and cassis, mineral and smoke come up as aromas, then follow as flavors. Good legs show the weight of the wine, which hits the palate tight and shows a bit of chalky acid, then opens into more lush milk chocolate barrel flavors."
Wellington,Merlot,83.0,20.0,1,"This is a little rugged, a little more raw and less concentrated than the other releases from this new Walla Walla winery. The wood sticks out a bit, though it's a very tasty wine with supple red fruit, an soft earthiness, and light suggestions of sandalwood and spice."
Wellington,Port,85.0,25.0,1,"This is 100% varietal, spicy and tart, with fine balance and focus. The fruit trends toward cherry and prune, with an earthy, tannic finish."
Wellington,Roussanne,91.0,25.0,1,"Lots of wood on the nose, and some scents of pickle that reflect the American oak barrels. The flavors follow along, spicy cranberry and raspberry fruit, with streaks of pickle and wood and a burst of alcoholic heat in the finish. The blend includes 17% Mourvèdre."
Wellington,Syrah,87.33,23.33,3,"From a vineyard known for producing powerfully ripe, dense fruit with wet-stone minerality, this wine delivers on many of those points. It offers intense, rich tastes of baked apple, graham-cracker crust and crème brûlée. Soft and layered, it ends in a statement of big fruit."
Wellington,Zinfandel,86.67,26.67,3,"Aromas of ripe grapes and vanilla make for a lush, inviting nose on this fruit-forward bottling of 49.5% Sangiovese, 49.5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Malbec. The juicy palate shows blackberries and black cherries as well as licorice and dark chocolate, with strong tannins giving textural balance."
Wente,Cabernet Franc,90.0,40.0,1,"Blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Syrah, RTW is somewhat classical in its black olive and dried herb, yet also rich and concentrated, with tannic bite and a taste of clove. It finishes like vanilla cola."
Wente,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.6,33.0,5,"This cuvée reflects the lean vintage with modest alcohol and slightly dilute fruit flavors. Pretty aromatics suggest rosewater and sandalwood, and the wine fades gracefully with plum and cherry fruit."
Wente,Chardonnay,89.8,31.2,5,"Sanguine and velvety, this richly derived wine made from one clone of Pinot Noir is tannic in black cherry, cinnamon and tar, with a lean, mid-length finish."
Wente,Merlot,87.75,32.0,4,"Attractive white-pepper aromas and powerful dark-fruit flavors combine with firm tannins in this full-bodied wine. It is bold and a bit rustic, and should pair well with a juicy hamburger or rich lasagna."
Wente,Pinot Blanc,89.0,25.0,1,"This is a dry, soft and firmly tannic wine, elusive in fruit but quite forward in dusty leather, chocolate and black pepper. Full bodied, it holds on to a density of concentration throughout."
Wente,Red Blend,86.0,100.0,2,"This pleasant and straightforward Chardonnay comes in a hock bottle for no apparent reason. It's accented with pine needle aromas and flavors of resin and crisp apple. Forward and fruity, the time in barrel seems to have mostly just rounded it off, without adding noticeable flavors."
Wente,Sauvignon Blanc,89.75,15.0,4,"The reserve gets 90% new French oak, and there is a strong scent of oaky toast, with flavors that follow. Plump cherry fruit fills a broad midpalate, finishing with rather hard tannins that show a green edge."
Wente,Syrah,88.0,15.0,1,"Tight and spicy, this offers a mix of red fruits, strong streaks of clove and licorice. There's an underlying taste of stem, and the acids leave a chalky aftertaste."
WesMar,Pinot Noir,90.3,43.7,10,Spiky hits of leather and black pepper accent a medium-bodied wine with a softness on the palate that's pleasantly easygoing. Dried herb and cedar mark the finish.
West of Temperance,Pinot Noir,90.0,45.0,1,"Chewy and tannic, this has plenty of barrel flavors, but is light on the fruit. Coffee, caramel and toasty components are all here, seeming to smother any ripe fruit that might fill out the middle."
West of Temperance,Teroldego,89.0,35.0,1,"Seared yellow apple, lemon rinds and pressed white flowers show on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering winery, which was recently acquired by the Gallo family. The texture is quite steely with bountiful acidity, but the flavors are a little flat on the sip, where stone fruit and squeezed citrus show."
Westerly,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,75.0,2,"Made from mostly Merlot grapes that went direct-to-press to preserve color and tannin, this is a dark, pink and nutty wine, full-bodied and somewhat intense. While dry, the fruit leans toward the tangy end of the spectrum. It's food friendly and thirst quenching."
Westerly,Bordeaux-style White Blend,86.0,30.0,1,"Oaky and tart, this is anchored by a bright raspberry flavor. There is a firm, toasty edge to the tannins, and plenty of buoyant acidity."
Westerly,Chardonnay,93.0,55.0,1,"Thick and meaty, this Syrah has an unusual-but-welcome aroma of marshmallow, surrounded by notes of dark plum, black currant and a streak of dark chocolate. With a long, lingering and rich finish, this will be great to drink in the winter months."
Westerly,Red Blend,95.0,75.0,1,"Chewy tannins give this wine a rustic edge, but the black cherry fruit and notes of fresh-cut tobacco are authentic to the variety. The finish is mouth-drying, which would make it just right with a fat cut of beef."
Westerly,Syrah,92.0,45.0,2,"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year, and this year they've chosen this superb Syrah. Whiffs of earth and bud, roasted meat and licorice fill the nose, with flavors following. The fruit is like brandy-soaked cherries, wrapped in all the roasted, earthy, organic layers. Tasted even better after being open for 24 hours."
Westerly,White Blend,88.0,35.0,1,"The 2008 Sineann Pinots are an elegant, refined group of wines, more expressive of Burgundian varietal character than any in memory, and the Resonance, as usual, is among the best. It has a vibrant purity to the fruit that rings true and long through mixed red berries, vivid acids, streaks of iron and earth, and sails on into a detailed and seamless finish."
Westport Winery,Chardonnay,83.0,25.0,1,"A barrel selection of Schindler fruit, this reserve notches up the color, density and alcohol without sacrificing the basic character and finesse of the vineyard. Here are the tight layers of bacon fat, stone, pepper and leaf, along with tart, lightly herbal red fruits. The core fruit is concentrated, fresh and primary, and promises excellent aging potential."
Westport Winery,Sangiovese,83.0,26.0,1,Herb and barrel spice aromas lead to plump cherry and cranberry flavors. The tannins bring some grip.
Westrey,Chardonnay,88.0,32.0,1,This wine comes from 35-year-old vines at French Creek Vineyard. Light aromas of spice and cream lead to a creamy palate marked with lighter-styled apple and stone-fruit flavors. It's a very pretty expression of the variety.
Westrey,Pinot Noir,89.5,37.0,2,"Aromas of orange peel, flowers, blue fruit and smoked meat are followed by light, spritely fruit flavors. The tannins bring some grip."
Westwood,Mourvèdre,90.0,58.0,1,"This pale-salmon sparkler brings aromas of citrus, strawberry and baked bread. The flavors are dry and lively, with tart acidity stretching out the finish."
Westwood,Pinot Noir,91.5,44.0,2,"Fresh-pressed blackberry, cedar, dark-chocolate shavings, charcoal and espresso grounds show on this slightly wound up, extremely dark wine. Coffee flavors come through strongly on the thick and sticky palate, where powerful acidity unleashes blueberries and dried herbs. It's a mouthful for certain."
Westwood,Red Blend,92.0,65.0,1,"The herb, wet stone and green-apple-skin aromas are light but provide intrigue and lead to a dry palate with well-balanced, juicy acids, a compelling feel and a spot on sense of balance. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
Westwood,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,38.0,1,Light red-cherry aromas meet with wild sagebrush and graphite on the light and easy nose of this wine from a family vineyard that recently came under new management. The palate offers cranberry juice lifted by crushed thyme and anise.
Westwood,Roussanne-Viognier,92.0,36.0,1,"Tart acidity provides freshness and succulence to the palate of this vineyard-designate—a well-resolved expression of plum, cranberry and red currant. Plush and soft, it does the variety justice, making the case for complexity and approachability in one glass."
Westwood,Syrah,89.0,40.0,1,"Roasted meats, black fruit, charcoal and tar show on the nose of this clonal selection from this pioneering winery that is now owned by Bill Foley. The medium-bodied sip shows roasted blackberries, boysenberries and black currants, with charred meat leading into a caramelized finish. The acid and tannin levels are solid right now and will age well too."
Westwood,White Blend,90.0,36.0,2,"This widely available and well-priced appellation blend shows dark aromas of black raspberry, elderberry, wet slate and crushed gravel on the nose. The wine makes a soft entry on the palate, where mulberry meets with Earl Grey tea and a pinch of anise."
Wetzel Estate,Gewürztraminer,84.0,15.0,1,"Part of the limited edition vineyard designate series, this stands apart for its elegant, aromatic style. Beet root, pomegranate and chocolate suggestions come together on the midpalate, seemingly gaining concentration as it finishes. Fresh, clean and well balanced, it spent just the right amount of time in one-third-new French oak."
Wetzel Estate,Pinot Blanc,84.0,15.0,1,"The delicate yet brilliant pink color of this rosé is stunning (Could it be protected by the darker glass, a rare packaging choice for the style?) and the wine inside matches up, starting with a brisk nose of red apple, white cherry, strawberry and lime. There's red plum and more strawberry to the sip. With a grippy texture and steadily rising acidity, this is one of the better pinks of the vintage."
Wetzel Estate,Pinot Noir,83.75,46.0,4,"Tightly focused acidity is the star of this well-executed, estate-grown and unoaked white. Floral jasmine and apple blossom ride along the nose, while flavors of lemon peel and apple integrate seamlessly on the rounded palate."
Wetzel Estate,Sparkling Blend,84.25,28.75,4,"Fairly shy aromas of blackberry juice, uncracked peppercorns and dried lilacs show on the nose of this bottling by Ryan Render. Cooked meat flavors are evident on the sip, including bacon fat and charred beef, and there is a rich blackberry-sauce component as well. Cracked pepper also arises, making this a Syrah that will please many palates."
Whalebone,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,55.0,1,"Always a top wine in this winery's broad portfolio of estate Pinot Noirs, this is spicy and lightly peppery, with a mix of bitter herb, cranberry and blackberry flavors and bright, supporting acidity. Its pleasing mineral backdrop provides an easy landing for the extended finish. Drink 2022 to 2030 for maximum enjoyment."
Whalebone,Red Blend,88.0,34.0,1,"Impenetrably dark in color, this potent wine marries black fruit to ample barrel accents of smoke and char. Though aged in just 5% new French oak, those dark scents and flavors permeate the wine. It's a style with broad appeal."
Whetstone,Pinot Noir,89.67,63.33,3,"Sur Peaux translates to “on the skins”—a maceration process that gives this wine its burnished copper hue. More importantly, it's crazy good: soft, supple, delicately spicy yet bone dry, with a buttery mouthfeel."
Whetstone,Syrah,94.0,60.0,1,"Crisp and tart in lemon peel and grapefruit, the loveliest aspect of this lightly ripe wine is its sublime texture, an earthy velvety expression of fineness and elegance that persists in its delicacy."
Whetstone,Viognier,91.0,45.0,1,"Blended from a range of vineyards, this tasty, toasty wine cloaks its raspberry fruit in chocolate malt-like flavor. Its components are clearly defined, fresh and appealing, and it showcases the sophisticated house style in a more widely-distributed, less expensive offering."
Whistler,Pinot Noir,90.5,52.0,4,"Snappy black raspberry and fresh plum combine for an almost effervescent experience on the nose, which also benefits from smoked beef and carnation aromas. The palate is also very energetic with black-plum and orange-juice flavors, finishing with strong acidity. This will last for years, but needs at least another year to fully integrate."
Whistler,Viognier,90.0,48.0,1,"This bottling's extremely fresh aromas of lime meet with a rounded clarified butter, drawing one in for sip after sip. That vibrancy extends to the lightly presented palate, where flavors of lime juice, lemon peels and crisp pear ride a rising wave of acidity across a tightly wound texture."
Whitcraft,Syrah,91.0,35.0,1,"This puts the spotlight on a single Dijon clone and delivers polished cherry fruit. It follows through with hints of graphite and the underlying minerality that is characteristic of this AVA. The wine is young and should be decanted, having spent just nine months in barrel prior to bottling."
White Hart Wine,Red Blend,93.0,40.0,1,"Thickly concentrated, this wine offers a wealth of crème brûléee richness and complexity, dotted in golden honey and a twist of lime. Supple and medium in build, it integrates the oak and ripeness at its core, finishing with a brightness of acidity that refreshes."
White Oak,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87.0,50.0,1,"The vineyard is planted to Dijon clones of Pinot Noir. The result is a concentrated, plush wine, herbal and savory with tightly hewn tannins, a tartness of cranberry and rhubarb, and a substantial finish of cinnamon, clove and darker fruit. The balance between the wine's richness and more ethereal components is nicely drawn."
White Rock Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,65.0,2,"From a field blend of Zinfandel, Alicante Bouschet and Petite Sirah, this wine is brick-red and earthy, inviting in dark, brambly fruit and just-right spice. With soft tannins and a long finish, it's classic Sonoma County Zin, fruity and in balance."
White Rock Vineyards,Chardonnay,90.5,50.0,2,"With a concentrated bouquet of black cherry and leathery earth, this straddles the richness of California fruit with an Old World layering of savory sumptuousness. Built with structure and subtle acidity, it is meant to be enjoyed at the table, a pork tenderloin or mushroom quiche among the pairing possibilities."
White Rose,Pinot Noir,88.67,95.0,3,"Winemaker Ryan Deovlet isn't afraid of prominent oak, so this comes on with a luscious butterscotch nose, and it immediately smells like it will be a silky wine. It is, with accents of vanilla and a touch of bitterness, but the overriding flavor is smokiness, reminiscent of the rustic Mexican liquor, Mezcal. This could easily handle pork carnitas."
Whitehall Lane,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,85.0,1,"Black as night in the glass, this heavy duty, Cabernet-led Bordeaux blend from one of the most visually stunning properties on the Central Coast is loaded with rich, luscious fruit and tannins that are built to last. There are stewed plums on the nose with warm slices of blueberry pie on the palate. Wait until at least 2019 for full enjoyment."
Whitehall Lane,Red Blend,91.0,25.0,1,"The 2008 Devotion is 41% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre and 29% Grenache. Winemaker Chris Dowsett notes that he is upping the percentage of Mourvèdre again in the 2009 version. It's a significant improvement, elevating this blend into a rarefied, tightly controlled, sculpted wine with wild berry and cherry, iron filings, dark chocolate and licorice, wrapped in firm, polished tannins."
Whitestone,Merlot,83.0,28.0,1,"This Sancerre-like effort shows amazing concentration and distinct, vineyard-driven flavors of grain and herb. Racy, textural, crisp and penetrating, it's lifted by a refreshing minerality. Lemon polish, citrus oil, a very delicate suggestion of honey in the nose and mouth, and above all a wonderful persistence make this a standout Sauvignon Blanc."
Whitman Cellars,Red Blend,88.0,24.0,2,"Pink grapefruit, a linear chalky component and the aromas of apricot jam on brie cheese rind show on the nose of this bottling from one of the region's oldest vineyards. There is tight focus to the palate, where green pear skins, pomelo pith, lemon zest and lime juice weave into an acidity that's strong yet expertly integrated."
Wild Coyote,Merlot,89.0,25.0,1,"This wine is 37% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with the rest split equally between Malbec and Syrah. Reticent aromas of vanilla and baking spices lead to full-feeling dark-fruit flavors, backed by lightly grainy tannins. The hang time on the finish is downright outrageous."
Wild Coyote,Syrah,85.0,25.0,1,"Waves of rich bacon fat, maple, caramelized black cherries, campfire smoke and an elegant touch of lavender show on the nose of this bottling, which includes 14% Counoise. Similar smoke shows on the palate, but it's more tart and acidic than expected, with underripe blackberry and black plum skin flavors. The tannins are fine-grained but firm. Drink 2018 through 2023."
Wild Coyote,Tannat,92.0,50.0,1,"This stellar bottling deftly combines both the bright and burned sides of the sipping experience, offering fresh crushed blueberries alongside caramel, cooked dark chocolate and charred toast on the nose. There's a great array of dried herbs once sipped, with flavors of dried blueberries, lamb char, espresso and pencil lead. Tons of depth."
Wild Coyote,Tempranillo,82.0,50.0,1,"Very inviting aromas of lemon curd, buttercream, white peach and pear blossom prove quite ripe but far from overdone on this blend of 40% Roussanne, 40% Marsanne and 20% Viognier. There is thinly focused but prevalent acidity to the sip, where peaches, lemon and cream flavos thrive. A well balanced and rich white Rhône blend, which is harder to pull off than it sounds."
Wild Coyote,Zinfandel,88.5,35.0,2,"Creamy bubbles rise through hay color in the glass, showing the slightest touch of salmon pink on the edges, with a lean and tight nose that shows tortilla dough, pink grapefruit rind and a sleek, steely gunmetal note. Crisp apple and sliced Meyer lemon flavors show on the palate, where the bubbles are foamy, the yeast is present but restrained and the style is very approachable."
Wild Hogge,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,89.0,32.0,1,"Showing incredible depth for such an affordable wine, Andrew Murray does it again with this widely available bottling. The gamy nose shows lamb, rosemary, uncracked peppercorns, light tobacco leaf, soy sauce and a touch of tar. Purple flowers rule the palate, with lavender, violet and blossoming rosemary notes, with thyme and white pepper spicing up boysenberry fruit."
Wild Hogge,Red Blend,92.0,34.0,1,"There's an honest suggestion of bacon and eggs at first in this wine, which follows with a tangy entry that sizzles on the palate. Full, luscious and honeyed in oak, it's a powerful expression that's also balanced between fruit and nuance."
Wild Horse,Chardonnay,93.0,35.0,1,"Lots of richness and a multi-layered personality make this deep-colored, full-bodied wine delicious and interesting too. It's a big red, with bold berry and black cherry flavors, an especially attractive texture that's velvety and firm at the same time, and a long, lingering finish."
Wild Horse,Pinot Noir,93.0,65.0,1,"A salty lick of saline brings the palate to attention before tingling acidity seals the experience: the wine's backbone a nicely balanced combination of generous oak that supports ripe fruit. Francois Freres and Taransaud barrels cradled the wine for 10 months, only 35% of it new, making for a robust yet elegant expression of the variety from this site."
Wild Meadows,Red Blend,86.0,11.0,1,"The old vine designation, though unregulated, is usually reserved for plantings at least a quarter century old. Though the first sniff suggests a wine that has been over-oaked, such is not the case. It has the concentration and fruit power—layers of citrus and stone fruit flavors—along with the depth and texture that older vines bring, to more than support the generous new oak."
Wild Ridge,Pinot Noir,90.0,50.0,1,"This 100% Sangiovese from this Sierra Foothills Sangiovese specialist has a giant mouthfeel, full of plummy and earthy dark cherry and caramel molasses. As big as the wine is, the tannins are softened and the wine has a long finish. An excellent wine to pair with Italian sausage, risotto or so many other Italian-inspired meals."
WildAire,Chardonnay,91.0,35.0,1,"A single-vineyard wine from Oregon can be a component rather than a complete wine, but here it is an absolute joy. Fragrant and complex, this offers pleasures for both nose and palate, with scents of leaf and spice and herb, leading into a surprisingly dense and textural blend of wild berry, rhubarb, melon and mixed tropical fruits. Fascinating and long, this is a fine example of Oregon Pinot at its most elegant and fascinating."
WildAire,Pinot Noir,91.5,40.0,2,"This opens with lots of spice, tart and light red fruits and some strongly herbal tannins. There is a big wash of sweet baking spice, source unknown, that offsets the stemmy and herbal quality of the fruit."
WildAire,Riesling,90.0,25.0,1,"The Rock Star Red is a 50/50 Cabernet/Syrah blend. The two grapes work well together in many wines, but here they seem a bit at odds. The Cabernet carries some green, herbal, pickle barrel flavors; the Syrah brings in pepper and spice, but neither has the ripeness to flesh out the wine sufficiently. There are flavors of plum and cooked cherry, then it hits some chewy tannins and stops short."
WildAire,Syrah,88.0,28.0,1,"A tart, all-purpose red, with 14 different grapes in the blend. The result, predictably, is generic. No particular variety dominates; it's a high acid red wine, with stiff tannins."
WildAire,Tempranillo,90.0,28.0,1,"Soft and approachable, with little evidence (in the mouth) of the 15.6% alcohol listed on the label, this is a pleasant, rather generically flavored red. Don't look for California-style jam; this is rather delicate, with strawberry and wild cherry fruit, light pepper, a hint of mint and light tannins."
WildAire,Viognier,91.0,19.0,1,"Coming from a vineyard best known for its Cabernet Franc, this wine offers aromas of fresh herbs, coffee, cherry and bittersweet chocolate. Cherry and chocolate flavors play well off of each other, with the finish lingering. The barrel influence plays a prominent role."
WildHaven,Merlot,84.0,15.0,1,"A playful blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Grenache, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah, this hearty bottling delivers something for everyone, from the austere, classic nature of the Bordeaux varieties to the fruitiness and savory leather tones of the Rhônes. It's made to be bold, black and enjoyable now; pack a bottle or two for your next adventures, eye patch optional."
Wilde Farm Wines,Red Blend,93.0,40.0,1,"A blend of 40% Cabernet Franc and 40% Malbec, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this appealing offering has aromas of vanilla, woodspice, raspberry and black tea. The cranberry and cherry flavors are restrained in feel, with tart acids that carry through the cranberry-filled finish."
Wilde Farm Wines,Syrah,92.0,38.0,2,"Pale yellow in color, this five-plus-year-old white has aromas of lees, dried apricot and flowers. The palate feels full bodied, but with lighter-styled flavors and a zing of acid on the finish."
Wilderotter,Barbera,88.0,29.0,1,"This tastes deep, ripe and yet very smooth and drinkable for its full body and firmly tannic texture. Aromas recall cedar, dark plums, blueberry and black cherry plus a whiff of mint, while the flavors are grand, dark and rich. Enjoy it now through 2019."
Wilderotter,Zinfandel,86.0,26.0,1,"Although this wine only saw 35% new French oak, the wood plays prominently, with aromas of toast and spice out in front of cherry and raspberry. The supple feel is where this wine shines, adding multiple layers to the concentrated flavors."
Wildewood,Pinot Noir,84.5,25.0,2,"There's no denying this wine's appeal with its aromas and flavors of dark fruit, café au lait, earth and herbs. It's restrained yet flavorful, with a lingering, coffee-filled finish."
WillaKenzie Estate,Chardonnay,90.0,26.5,2,"Barrel fermented in new and used French oak and aged sur lie for seven months, this appealing wine brings aromas of pear, spice, fig and papaya. The Sémillon blended in (16%) adds to the palate's richness and weight, with the pleasingly long finish contributing to the enjoyment."
WillaKenzie Estate,Pinot Gris,89.0,20.0,1,"Coming from vines planted in 1979 or earlier, this wine offers aromas of yellow apple, melon, honey and starfruit. It's lightly spritzy and drinks off dry, with a textured feel."
WillaKenzie Estate,Pinot Noir,88.33,45.83,6,"Rough, earthy and tannic, with simple, high-toned, black cherry fruit, and substantial tannins that seem to have been somehow smoothed over, leaving the wine a bit dull."
Willamette Valley Vineyards,Chardonnay,88.35,33.94,17,"Leather and dust, with thin raspberry fruit that is pretty well buried under the barnyard flavors."
Willamette Valley Vineyards,Pinot Noir,88.77,44.63,52,"Chock-a-block full of strawberry, black cherry and a sliver of orange peel, this wine is big-boned, well-structured and fleshy. Mouthfilling and juicy, the palate shows touches of black tea and tobacco, making for a lively tension between the earthiness and exuberance of fruit. Drink now through 2022."
Willamette Valley Vineyards,Riesling,84.0,14.0,1,"This Ponzi-owned vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA, yet is listed simply as Willamette Valley. Aromatically intense and intriguing, it opens quickly with scents of chamomile, plum, peach and apricot, leading to hints of honey and tea. Aged entirely in neutral oak, this wine fully engages the palate through a lingering, beautifully proportioned and optimally ripe finish."
Willamette Valley Vineyards,Sparkling Blend,87.0,55.0,1,"Wy'east is better than ever in this vintage, a divine balancing act with berry, plum, Asian spices and chocolate all in focus. From the opening scents, laden with complex and perfectly fused notes of blackberry, mineral, coriander and cacao, right on through the extended, captivating finish, this is a wine that is almost impossible to put down, yet will drink well at least through 2025."
Willful,Pinot Noir,90.0,41.67,3,"Shy in the glass, this wine needs more time in bottle to unravel its complexities of rose petal and cardamom, flanked by crisp red cherry and raspberry. Tangy acidity is the star and backbone of the lovely, structured wine, which is delightful now, but worth cellaring through 2023."
William Church,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,31.67,6,"This bottling spent 20 months in French oak (30% new), and incorporates fruit from Ponzi's Aurora, Abetina and Madrona vineyards. Superripe aromas and flavors conjure up a rich and riveting mix of black cherry with amaro-like botanical nuances. This profound wine is already irresistible, but stash a few bottles in your cellar, to drink now through 2030."
William Church,Cabernet Franc,91.0,36.0,1,"Plump blackberry and ripe black cherries meet with caramel sauce and a hint of slate on this nonvintage exploration of Petite Sirah, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. A sip reveals blackberry, dark chocolate, cola and a bit of smoke flavorings, proving plush yet brisk, ripe yet restrained with a rocky minerality."
William Church,Malbec,89.57,36.0,7,"A site planted to the Rued clone of Chardonnay in classic Russian River Valley Goldridge soils, Searby is expressive in honeysuckle and orange blossom floral tones. This balanced wine is soft and round, its time in oak reaching an apex on the finish."
William Church,Red Blend,89.0,30.62,8,"The deep, saturated color and vivid, smoky flavors indicate a monster wine, but the reality is more complex and interesting. It smells like boysenberry, grilled beef and black pepper, tastes grapey and berrylike but also roasted and savory. It is surprisingly light-bodied considering how flavorful it is."
William Church,Syrah,90.33,45.0,3,"Wood smoke and charcoal aromas lead to flavors like cola, steak sauce and cherries in this dramatic, Rhône-style wine blended from notoriously meaty Mourvèdre plus Grenache and Syrah. A touch of sweetness and light tannins complete the picture of this wine made by a longtime Rhône variety specialist."
William Church,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,90.0,34.0,1,"One of the producer's signature varieties, this impresses in its nutty gamy overview that recalls the sensations and smells of an Italian deli. Rich red fruit makes for a juicy core built around substantial tannins that become supple on the palate. The finish is about black pepper."
William Grassie,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.4,47.4,5,"High-pitched acidity helps balance the bigger, bolder elements of truffle earth, leather and cherry cordial than run freely in this full-bodied softly textured wine."
William Grassie,Malbec,90.0,49.0,1,"This wine's plum and Bing cherry flavors glide smoothly through the midpalate with moderate density. It was sourced from own-rooted vines from a half dozen vineyards, notably Temperance Hill and Sunnyside."
William Grassie,Red Blend,87.67,31.0,3,"This blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon offers lots of thyme and oregano on the savory nose as well as black plum, mocha dust and graphite. The palate is rather light bodied, with dried herbs and the slightest hint of green pepper, all set against richer black fruit and pencil shavings."
William Grassie,Rosé,88.0,18.0,1,"The nose on this wine from the Willow Creek area plays between the lighter elements of bright red cherries and heavier hints of tar, with a bit of sour plum thrown in as well. The palate is loaded with chalky tannins, offering flavors of black cherries and licorice, but it could use some more time in bottle."
William Grassie,Syrah,87.0,39.0,1,"Boldly flavored and full-bodied, this is marked by strong, spicy-sweet oak aromas and flavors. It has a massive richness of tannins, gobs of ripe boysenberry and black cherry character, and a very deep red color. Despite the hefty structure, it's drinkable now if accompanied by equally rich food."
William Harrison,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85.0,85.0,1,"This bottling comes from the winery's Rhinefarm Estate Vineyard near the town of Sonoma, planted to eight separate Pinot Noir blocks. Savory in cranberry and cassis and quite austere, it's balanced in aromas of rose petal and a taste of black tea. Tannins are ripe yet firm, providing structure to help age the wine further."
William Harrison,Cabernet Franc,87.0,65.0,1,"Oaky, spicy and tannic, this is showing some sharp edges around moderately ripe plum and cherry fruit. It's solid and substantial, a bit blocky, and currently showing more barrel influence than fruit. All estate fruit, 40% new French oak. Additional bottle age might improve the score."
William Harrison,Chardonnay,92.0,38.0,1,"The residual sugar is not indicated, but this is not a super-sweet dessert wine; it falls more into the off-dry camp. A mix of orange, peach and apricot fruit, slightly candied, it has buoyant acidity and a toasty finish from nine months in all new French oak. Foie gras anyone?"
William Hill Estate,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.67,95.0,3,"Deeply purple aromas of acai fruit and grape Jolly Rancher candies get a bit more serious with the scent of smoked cigars. The grape-juice element carries to the easy-to-drink, not overly complex palate, which will work well with food or just by itself."
William Hill Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.67,60.0,3,"Imagine sniffing barely ripe peach and guava through their skins to understand the brisk and subtle nose of this wine. The flavors are also subtle, but quite refreshing, with squeezed citrus and poached apple shining brightest."
William Hill Estate,Chardonnay,90.0,45.0,3,"This wine from the recently approved El Pomar District is tropically perfumed with lychee candy and a hint of passionfruit. Bouncy acidity on the front of the palate leads into red apple fruit and citrus skin bitterness, and wipes up with a zing on the palate."
William Hill Estate,Malbec,90.0,58.0,2,"Juicy in tropical mango, coconut flake and guava, this sophisticated Chardonnay is measured in texture and weight, the body lean with a touch of vanilla richness on the finish."
William Hill Estate,Merlot,87.0,17.0,1,"This is 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in neutral oak. It's bright and peppery and lightly herbal, with tart strawberry and cherry tomato flavors."
William Hill Estate,Petit Verdot,90.0,55.0,1,"Light cherry and pomegranate fruit tones dive into a darker beet-focused nose on this bottling, backed up by touches of crushed asphalt. The flavors are delicate, with a sparse plum-fruit backbone lifted by strong herbal components of tarragon, marjoram, pepper and a bit of juniper."
William Hill Estate,Red Blend,90.0,40.0,3,"Starting out brooding, this wine opens with notes of mortared violets, purple fruit, herbs and plum. The dark fruit flavors are dense and full, putting a focus on the purity."
William James,Syrah,93.0,29.0,1,"Thick black cherry, vanilla, licorice and kirsch aromas show on the nose of this blend of 40% Syrah, 34% Grenache and 26% Mourvèdre. The palate is also rich and juicy, with black currant, nutmeg and caramel-laced cappuccino flavors, bolstered by bright acidity."
William Knuttel,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,40.0,1,"This wine is 100% varietal, coming from old blocks at Dionysus and Upland vineyards. It enchants the senses with aromas of pure blackberry along with dried herb and coffee that are followed by restrained yet luxurious espresso and cherry flavors. The balance is impeccable and the finish lingers."
William Knuttel,Chardonnay,91.0,38.0,1,"Winemaker Bill Brousseau taps his family vineyard for this bottling that leans toward a more delicate style, offering light white flowers, yellow melon, tangerine peels, kumquat, Asian pear and a hint of clove and cinnamon spice. A baking-soda energy pops on the palate, where lemon blossoms and pink-grapefruit rinds collide for a tart chorus."
William Knuttel,Pinot Noir,91.0,45.0,1,"One of the four vineyards that this winery entirely uses as a monopole bottling, this wine shows smoked pork, baked raspberry, crushed rosebuds and a touch of sesame on the nose. The palate's backbone is a tangy cranberry fruit that is enhanced by pencil lead and cedar spice."
William Marie,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,29.0,1,"This is an austere, elegant study in power and grace, blending 53% Merlot with 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Substantial and tannin-defined as many of its brethren of this vintage, it shows cedar, pencil shavings and a touch of tobacco, more savory than fruit-driven. Drink now through 2023."
Williams Selyem,Chardonnay,92.94,57.35,17,"A touch of new oak adds complexity and a good, gripping sensation to this medium-bodied and nicely structured wine. Adding to the light toast and smoke aromas, the fruit flavors bring tart cherry and raspberry plus some bass notes of clove and black tea. The wine has an appetizing balance and persistent flavors. It will be best after 2018."
Williams Selyem,Gewürztraminer,89.0,40.0,2,"This wine is aged in neutral oak and shows salty lemon and guava notes atop a creamy, crisply layered texture. Bright and bold, it satisfies on the palate and should impress further as it opens in the glass, or even with a touch more time in the bottle."
Williams Selyem,Pinot Noir,94.46,69.44,48,"From Rick Longoria's own vineyard comes this high-toned, focused bottling showing Asian pear juice, hot toast and apple blossom on the stonefruit-driven nose. There is steel structure on the sip, which fresh with more fruity pear elements, but also bound to a chipped-slate minerality."
Williams Selyem,Port,92.0,40.0,2,"At first blush this reserve seems more oaky, more open and more overtly alcoholic than the just-released Leonetti 2008 Merlot and 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon. After many hours of breathing time it fills in with pretty plummy fruit, toast, caramel, whiffs of smoke, cedar and cigar box, and dry tannins."
Williams Selyem,Zinfandel,93.75,58.25,4,"Fragrant and lush with floral/citrus aromas, this stainless-fermented Chardonnay is inviting and seductive. Brilliant, bright fruit anchors a wine that is tense and dense and vividly thrilling. The acids are natural and flavors seamlessly run from lemon/lime to pineapple to orange, and keep on keeping on, with fresh, water-washed rock in the finish."
Willow Crest,Pinot Gris,86.0,14.33,3,Strong aromas and flavors like smoke and bacon seem heavy in this medium-bodied but tannic wine. A dish with bacon might bring it around.
Willow Crest,Riesling,86.67,14.67,3,"Rough, sinewy and oaky, this full-bodied wine is concentrated and thick, a robust expression of bitter black fruit and leather."
Willow Crest,Sauvignon Blanc,83.0,12.0,1,"Juicy blackberry and black currant coast across a softly layered wine that's approachable and ready to drink, dusted in tannins and dried herbs."
WillowBrook Cellars,Pinot Noir,89.75,40.5,4,"Sourced from what winemaker Don Corson calls “the best of the best”, this five-grape blend is modeled after Chateau St. Jean's Cinq Cépages. It shows a carefully sculpted frame, with rich, dark, smoky tannins chiseled into a tight foundation for the dark currant and black cherry fruit. Notes of pepper and spice add interest to the finish, which carries a hint of minerality."
WillowBrook Cellars,Zinfandel,85.0,32.0,1,"The wine is two-thirds Grenache, 30% Syrah and the rest Mourvèdre. It's warm and fruity, lightly spicy and finishing with tannins showing green tea and leaf. This is mostly Elerding fruit from the Horse Heaven Hills vineyard; balanced and firm."
Willowbrook,Pinot Noir,86.0,42.0,2,"The Jerome reserve is exactly what you want and expect in a reserve. Not just bigger, not just more of everything—it has that—but without sacrificing terroir or balance. Supple, veined with red fruits, purple fruits, smoke, earth and barrel toast, the wine moves sinuously across the palate into a full-bore finish. Lots of life ahead."
Wilridge,Barbera,87.25,27.25,4,"Mirabelle is the darkest, chewiest, most tannic of the three clonal selection Pinots offered by Vidon. It's a Pinot in Cab clothing. Chewy, dense, ripe fruit keeps it all in proportion, a thick black cherry core with rings of chocolate. Think Saturn in a glass."
Wilridge,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.75,34.75,4,"A sensational varietal Petit Verdot that's rich and velvety, lush and intense, with a hint of Bordeaux's typical herbiness, that evolves into some of the best blackberry, mocha and spicy chocolate you can imagine. Winemaker John Kinney had originally planned to blend the two barrels that eventually became this wine. Be glad he didn't. The grapes were sourced from Ghielmetti Vineyard, the primo vineyard to look for in Livermore wines."
Wilridge,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,20.0,1,"Tight and tannic, like red brick, bread and caramel, this Lodi Primitivo has 5% Barbera mixed in but the entire effort tastes of not-quite-ripe blackberries."
Wilridge,Chardonnay,87.0,18.0,1,"An inexpensive, large-production Pinot that's overly earthy and a little thin on the finish with a smidgen of residual sugar thrown in too, but reasonably priced and decently quaffable with food."
Wilridge,Grenache,87.0,23.0,1,One must strain to smell the ripe plum at first in this wine that is otherwise more tannic than juicy or flavorful. Buoyed by American oak and a dash or two of Syrah and Petite Sirah it's rightly priced.
Wilridge,Malbec,88.0,21.5,2,"Dark, dark, dark is this estate-grown Syrah, closed at the nose except for the profusion of alcohol, grippy with lots of oak and crazy, teeth-staining tannins."
Wilridge,Muscat Blanc,81.0,30.0,1,"Half of the wine was whole-cluster fermented, and only native yeast was employed. It's got a tart and tangy quality, with pure fruit flavors of cranberry, strawberry and raspberry. The acids are clean and the wine crisply refreshing."
Wilridge,Nebbiolo,86.5,27.25,4,"From the owners of another marquee vineyard nearby, Sun Chase, this wine is expressive and expansive on the palate, dark red-purple in color, thick and dense on the palate. Blackberry, black plum and black pepper rise to the fore, built along a continuum of earthy forest floor. Tannin and oak are interwoven well, before a soft finish."
Wilridge,Pinot Gris,84.0,40.0,1,"Aged in 100% once-filled barrels, this smooth and savory wine blends four different Dijon clones. The spicy raspberry and cherry fruit coats the tongue, wrapped in light caramel and toast. It's a very pretty, elegant wine, drinking nicely already, but one that should continue to hold together well through 2020."
Wilridge,Red Blend,85.0,20.0,2,"This is the most widely distributed, highest-production Pinot Noir from Archery Summit. It's forward and fruity, with generous, ripe strawberry and cherry fruit. There is a steely sheen to the finishing flavors, like licking a knife blade, and the tannins pack enough muscle to further improve the wine through 2018–2020."
Wilridge,Riesling,87.0,18.0,1,"The fermentation with the stems intact brings some earthy qualities front and center, to good effect. This is the most distinctive entry among the winery's eight Pinots, further enhanced by the use of wild yeasts. Scents of clover and hints of watercress and bark highlight the flavors of beetroot and brambly berry fruit. You will have fun playing this against a variety of potential food matchups."
Wilridge,Sagrantino,87.0,40.0,1,"The color of this full-bodied wine is deep red and aromas are dense with dark fruit like black plum and blueberry, accented with earthy nuances. The mouthfeel is rich and almost thick, as firm but fine-textured tannins coat the tongue and concentrated flavors of dark chocolate and blueberry soak through. This should improve through at least 2020."
Wilridge,Sangiovese,87.5,35.0,2,"One of the top Pinot rosés of the vintage, this is beautiful to look at, to sniff and to sip. The color of pale pink cherry blossoms, it matches rather delicate complexity to surprising concentration, pushing ripe cherry fruit front and center. It's finished dry, and should not be over-chilled, or you'll miss the lovely aromatics."
Wilridge,Syrah-Mourvèdre,86.33,33.0,3,"Chenin Blanc is quite rare in Oregon, and this wine, from vines planted just five years previously, may inspire others to follow suit. Aromas of fresh herb and citrus oil lead into a tangy palate with lime, lemon verbena and expressive minerality. The balance and length are just right, and the varietal character is in evidence throughout."
Wilridge,Touriga Nacional,88.0,23.0,1,"Not a shy wine, this looks very dark and smells smoky and meaty. It tastes extra ripe and rich, showing off both the grapes and the sweet-seeming oak with which the wine was apparently aged. There is a strong maple syrup and smoked bacon flavor, a thick, tongue-coating texture and lingering finish."
Wilridge,Viognier-Roussanne,83.0,20.0,1,"This tastes bold in flavor and feels lavish in texture. Aromas resemble red cherry, cinnamon and nutmeg, while the flavors are ripe and spread out on the palate, seeming to form layers of fruit, spice and maple. Smooth and flavorful, it's appealing from first sniff to finish."
Wilridge,Zweigelt,88.75,32.5,4,"Fully ripened in this exemplary vintage, this boasts fleshy cherry and plum fruit, with tasty confectionary highlights. Ten months aging in 25% new French oak contributes to those sweet notes, and a touch of sassafras and cola streaks across the finish."
Wilson,Petite Sirah,87.5,33.0,2,"This wine takes time to come around, but once it does, oak and pencil shavings season an herbal core that's tight and classic. Black licorice and espresso enter the fray, expanding on the palate's blackberry and cassis. Cellar through 2020–2022."
Wilson,Primitivo,86.0,40.0,1,"This wine is a blend of Grenache (49%), Syrah (20%), Cinsault (16%), Mourvèdre (9%) and Counoise. Complex aromas of raspberry, blueberry, dried herbs and pepper lead to reserved yet rich fruit flavors that put a premium on purity. Give it time to open up."
Wilson,Zinfandel,86.92,44.08,13,"One of the Hahn family's top brands, this bottling shows cola, clove and dense cranberry juice aromas, offering dense yet tart red fruit against uncrushed spice. Mossy earth plays into the palate, where more dried cranberry notes mix with thyme, dried sage, juniper and eucalyptus."
Winc,Cabernet Sauvignon,86.0,31.0,1,"Battalion­s of tannin accompany ripe fruit flavors in this bold, full-bodied wine made from Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot. A supportive wrap of astringency from layers of fine tannin bolsters the rich blackberry and blueberry flavors, while flashy, spicy, smoky, new-oak accents infuse everything from the aroma to the finish."
Winc,Pinot Noir,88.0,42.0,1,"An unusually vivid gold color is the first indication that this medium-bodied wine will turn up the dials on flavor. Aromas resemble wood smoke, nutmeg, sandalwood and vanilla, while flavors are subtly fruity but largely oaky in the form of marzipan, toasted bread and other savory nuances. It is gorgeous in a voluptuous way."
Wind Rose,Barbera,89.0,30.0,2,"Woody aromatics of myrrh and frankincense meld with crushed cinnamon, condensed hibiscus, red berries and black pepper on the nose of this bottling. Black cherry shows at the tip of the sip, then drops into incense, pine and juniper flavors, revealing cola and coffee notes toward the finish."
Wind Rose,Cabernet Sauvignon,85.0,22.0,1,"This tiny-production wine shows an attention to detail in the vineyard and cellar. The clonal selection shines, given partial barrel-fermentation, partial stainless steel, all aged in mostly neutral French oak. Honeysuckle aromas jump from the glass, followed by viscous, juicy tropical elements of mango and lychee. It finishes dry and lemony."
Wind Rose,Malbec,88.0,20.0,1,"Aromas of black raspberry, black cherry and a cinnamon spice are laid across a slate-driven minerality on the nose of this bottling. It's plush on the sip, with hibiscus and raspberry notes, lifted by pepper, camphor and white sage elements."
Wind Rose,Nebbiolo,87.0,30.0,1,"From the mighty Hyde in Carneros, this medium-bodied white blossoms with tropical fruit and briny minerality, a forceful combination that gives this wine both power and elegance. Textured in candied Meyer lemon, it finishes crisply and the right kind of sour."
Wind Rose,Pinot Grigio,88.0,16.0,1,"Slightly reductive on the nose, this bottling from a very coastal vineyard outside of Cambria shows mossy forest floor, jerked meat, dried cranberries, turned earth, sesame oil and salt on the nose. The palate combines concentrated, lush raspberry with bay leaf, lots of turned earth and chaparral seasonings."
Wind Rose,Primitivo,88.0,25.0,2,"Smooth and sultry purple fruit and flower notes get more specific on the black pepper and blackberry elements in this bottling from the family's original blocks, planted in 1992 and 1993. The palate is both dynamic and straightforward, with nuanced blueberry-blackberry fruits decorated by peppery spice that dances across solid structure into the long finish."
Wind Rose,Red Blend,88.0,19.33,3,"The winery's value bottling, this was vinified principally in stainless steel, with 25% in neutral oak. It's a chunky, earthy style, letting a bit of tart cherry fruit peek through. Tannins are drying, with a textural finish tasting lightly of concrete."
Wind Rose,Sangiovese,87.0,22.0,1,"This is the first release of the new vintage from Soléna. Primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry seem a bit disjointed, and there is a hole in the midpalate. A suggestion of rubber tire sets in as the wine finishes. More bottle age is in order."
WindVane,Chardonnay,90.0,40.0,2,"Scents and flavors of beet root, rhubarb and cranberry are front and center in this stiff, tart wine with root and acidic flavors. It spent 22 months in one-third new French oak, but that doesn't register on the palate."
WindVane,Pinot Noir,92.0,80.0,1,"This is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon blended with 16% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc. It shows a nice interplay of fruit and barrel with notes of cocoa, cherry, dry chocolate and toast supported by well-integrated tannins. The mid-palate still needs some time to fully come together but when it does, it will be a beauty."
Windemere,Chardonnay,92.0,25.0,1,"Aged 19 months in American and French oak (68% new), it's lush and appealing with notes of vanilla and other barrel spices accenting herbs and red fruit. The palate is creamy in feel with tart, mouthwatering acids that draw out the flavors for a long finish."
Windemere,Pinot Noir,93.0,40.5,2,"Designated unoaked, this flavorful Chardonnay proves the grape has more going on than its reputation suggests, when sourced from a great vineyard (such as Conner Lee) and carefully managed. Textural with melon, pear, apple and light tropical influences, this is long, complex and utterly delicious."
Winderlea,Pinot Noir,90.4,53.04,25,"This dry-tasting Riesling contains only 6.6 g/L of residual sugar. Balanced and fresh peach, pear and tangerine fruit flavors combine on the palate for a full, round and tasty take on the grape."
Windmill,Zinfandel,84.0,12.0,1,"Not a mere whole-cluster wine, the Stalker is made by drying the stalks separately and adding them to whole berries. It's slightly chalky as a result, with a green edge to the tannins and green tea flavors. Black cherry, espresso and cacao components also factor in. Give it another couple of years and drink after 2020."
Windrun,Pinot Noir,93.0,33.0,1,"Tight in tannin weight and breadth, this big-boned wine is muscular in leather, blackberry and mocha, and robust in power and ripeness. The force of its flavor finds additional strength and length on the finish."
Windstream,Chardonnay,90.0,25.0,1,"Crunchy red fruit is front and center in this vineyard-designate, well capturing the tone of the appellation. Raspberry, black tea and brooding tannins surround a light-bodied frame further highlighted with violet and cardamom."
Windstream,Pinot Noir,88.0,40.0,1,"Consistent with many other Timothy Malone Pinots, this artfully melds black cherry fruit with a broad streak of cola and refreshing minerality. There's a touch of black licorice and impressive balance throughout."
Windy Oaks,Pinot Noir,91.5,34.0,2,"Golden in color, this is a creamy voluptuous white wine, fermented and aged entirely in new French oak. Melon, spicy nutmeg and fig build flavor around a core of thick texture and concentration, finishing in buttery toast."
Wine Out West,Riesling,88.0,13.0,1,"Dark-pink-orange in color, this wine is muted in floral tones of beauty and simplicity. Crisp, clean and simple layers of creamy vanilla are mixed with Meyer lemon and white peach. Refreshing and light on its feet, it's memorable in its stony minerality and its full embrace of citrus intrigue."
Wine Saur,Red Blend,86.0,15.0,1,"Mid-weight and balanced in flavor and texture, this reserve-tier wine combines pungent jasmine aromas with flavors of crunchy green apple and Meyer lemon. The finish shows a toasty oak note, layered in a touch of salt."
Wine o'Clock,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.0,26.0,1,"Made entirely from this rare variety and fermented and aged in stainless steel, this is a picnic wine meant to be enjoyed without hesitation. It's a light-bodied celebration of lemon peel and chamomile that's light, dry and juicy."
Wineglass Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,45.0,1,This barrel-fermented wine has an aggressive toasty aroma that carries over into the flavors. Its ripe apple and buttered toast notes lead to a finish accented with coconut. A Chardonnay lover's Pinot Gris.
Winery by the Creek,Fumé Blanc,84.0,18.0,1,"Part saignée, part fermented specifically for rosé, this bone dry and elegant wine offers a cascade of strawberry, raspberry and tangerine flavors. Its acidity punches through, lifting the palate and bringing its texture and length into focus."
Winery by the Creek,Malbec,87.0,22.0,1,"An unusually bright-gold color and aromas like vanilla and nutmeg signal a complex style for this unusually textured and nicely viscous wine that is technically light bodied in terms of alcohol. Balanced out by good acidity, it is not overtly fruity but goes for complexity and spiciness that linger on the finish."
Winery by the Creek,Petite Sirah,89.0,40.0,1,"Barrel-fermented in half new, half neutral oak, this tasty wine offers crisp highlights of lemon and orange peel, along with substantial apple, kiwi and pear flavors. An appealing touch of crème brûlée comes out as it makes its graceful exit."
Winery by the Creek,Sangiovese,84.0,16.0,1,"Dried fruit flavors give a Port-like character to this full-bodied, mature and dry red wine. It smells like cherries and prunes and tastes juicy and ripe."
Winery by the Creek,Sauvignon Blanc,83.0,18.0,1,"A blend of Riesling and Muscat with a pinch of Gewürztraminer, this wine offers vibrant aromas of orange peel, fresh flowers, spice and jasmine that don't entirely meld. It drinks dry with light concentration and a slightly bitter finish."
Winery by the Creek,Sémillon,85.0,18.0,1,"Mostly Sangiovese, this wine appears to have seen some oxygen exposure that interferes with its blue fruit and herb aromas. It drinks quite sweet with a mixture of chocolate and cherry flavors."
Winery by the Creek,Tempranillo,83.0,26.0,1,"The fragrance is almost otherworldly; sweet, dense and lightly lifted. This is a sinewy wine, that begins with compact power and focused, tart red fruits—predominantly raspberry and currant. At first juicy and tart, with hours of breathing time the wine broadens out into a wider spectrum of Cabernet fruits; cassis, blackberry and black cherry."
Winery by the Creek,Zinfandel,85.0,26.0,1,"Bob Betz calls this his first-ever “reserve style” wine from Bordeaux varieties. It started with a single barrel of Red Willow Cabernet Franc and evolved into this six-barrel blend. Le Parrain opens with whiffs of smoke, gun metal and rock weaving through the dense red fruits. Pipe tobacco and licorice flavors come into play from the barrel aging. As the wine slowly opens, the flavors expand and blend, and the textural quality that Betz refers to expresses itself in a graceful, three-dimensional finish."
Wines Gone Wild,Rosé,87.0,14.0,1,"This is just the second varietal bottling of Marsanne—single vineyard at that—from McCrea. Firm and fleshy, with clear melon flavors, it shows a dash of cinnamon along the way. The finish brings on graham cracker accents, though only neutral oak was used."
Wines Gone Wild,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,14.0,2,"Light in color and only just faintly aromatic, Amador Cellars' Sangiovese tastes of red cherry and blueberry with a tight tannin structure that suggests giving it 3–5 years more time."
Winter's Hill,Pinot Blanc,87.33,28.67,3,"Blueberry, dried lilac, crushed violet and black pepper form a classic nose on this Merlot-led Bordeaux blend from Paso Robles' celebrated Westside. The well-integrated, complex palate features fruit, herbs, spice and tar, as if each one plays back-to-back solos."
Winter's Hill,Pinot Gris,87.25,22.5,4,"Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie and Winemaker Joey Tensley converge on a blend of Syrah, Merlot, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon that's worth sitting on until at least 2019. Woody, cigar box aromas pick up notes of camphor and flashes of red fruit, and the flavors fall in line around the cedar, with blueberry, black cherry and milk chocolate."
Winter's Hill,Pinot Noir,88.65,42.7,20,"An aromatic profile of crushed mint, hot gravel and red fruit introduces this blend of 83% Grenache and 17% Mourvèdre. It's lightweight on the palate, but with complex flavors of herb and spice that swirl around a core of blackberry fruit and finish with mouthwatering acidity."
Winter's Hill,Rosé,85.0,19.0,2,"Quirky, art-minded winemaker Matthias Sanguis crafts a stellar Syrah, with a lush bouquets of violets, blue raspberry, black peppercorns and vanilla. The palate, bound together with a lean acidic line down the middle, presents dark but tart cherries, sweet tobacco and the tang of plum peel."
Winter's Hill,White Blend,86.0,25.0,1,"This blend of 50% Syrah, 23% Petite Sirah, 17% Mourvèdre and 10% Grenache presents a delicious strawberry cake nose, backed up with dried purple flowers and cigar box backbone. On the palate, elegant purple fruits are laced with leather and pepper, finishing with a cleansing tartness."
Wise Villa,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,40.0,2,"One of two Sparkman Syrahs, Darkness showcases fruit from two stellar Yakima valley vineyards, Boushey and Olsen. A whiff of Syrah funk, herb and earth ties into dried blueberry with a brambly, plummy component. Lovely details of nutmeg with a streak of vanilla keep the flavors interesting through a long finish."
Wise Villa,Chardonnay,89.0,35.0,1,"This is pure Chenin Blanc from Kiona's 1976 planting, fermented in concrete eggs and left on the lees for five months. A pretty golden hue, this bone dry wine did not undergo malolactic and has retained its sturdy acid base. Rich with glycerine, it's scented with and has flavors of lemon oil, orange peel and candied pineapple."
Wise Villa,Petite Sirah,91.0,35.0,1,"Lightly toasted tobacco, blueberry pie and cedar scents lead the way on this single-vineyard Cab. Fresh blueberry on the palate combines with a great arc of flavors that ends in a chewed cigar finish."
Wise Villa,Red Blend,86.67,31.0,3,"Unctuous and ripe in caramel and toasty aromas, this is deep golden in color but completely crisp and balanced in the glass. The nose is so overwhelming that the flavors take time to show. Once they do, it's a celebration of green apple and melon enveloped in complex minerality and a supple body."
Wise Villa,Sangiovese,85.0,34.5,2,"Light, tart, slightly green fruit flavors don't add up to much. There is an undertone of old barrel or something not quite fresh. Simple and plain."
Wise Villa,Tempranillo,88.0,35.0,1,"This has the sharp, citrus skin phenolics characteristic of many Viogniers, but a rather soft middle tastes like green bananas more than citrus. Those banana flavors roll into the finish, then quickly fade."
Wise Villa,Torrontés,90.0,30.0,3,"Relatively low in alcohol (12.2% is the listing), this is thin on fruit but does offer soft flavors of yeasty bread dough, along with some stemmy tannins."
Wise Villa,Touriga Nacional,89.0,34.0,1,"Big, bold and unreservedly stemmy, this Carmenère pulls in enough black-cherry fruit to balance out the herbs. The assertive tannins carry notes of earth, dried leaf and dark chocolate."
Witness Tree,Pinot Noir,88.0,40.0,1,"A standout in the portfolio, this is a sleek, strong effort with tart purple fruits and mineral underpinnings. There's an ample whiff of smoke and a general earthiness around the tannins, with a hint of iron ore. The chalky finish is the only distraction."
Wm. Harrison,Cabernet Franc,86.0,65.0,1,"Olallieberries, strawberry blossoms, caramel, maple syrup and cola shows on the complex nose of this blend of 52% Grenache, 31% Syrah, 12% Mourvèdre and 5% Counoise. The palate shows concentrated boysenberry, tar and coffee flavors, proving more tart than the region's usually powerful Rhône bottlings, and a refreshing change of pace."
Wm. Harrison,Chardonnay,91.0,38.0,1,"Light and vivacious on the nose, this offers lime blossoms, Anjou pear skins and sharp white jasmine flowers. The aromas settle into a salted peach-candy character. Tonic, lime blossoms and lime-zest flavors show on the palate, quite bright and nearly tropical."
Wolff,Chardonnay,92.0,24.0,1,"Abacela makes up to four different Tempranillos in a given vintage, this being the entry-level bottle. And a fine introduction it is, with vivid red and black berries, a dusting of sweet spices, a gentle whiff of tanned leather, chalk and ample tannins. Aged in both French and American oak, 15% new, it is drinking quite nicely already."
Wolff,Pinot Noir,93.0,29.0,1,"This 15th edition of this nonvintage blend, sourced entirely from estate grapes (principally Tempranillo), is a sure-fire palate pleaser. Fresh and youthful, it's bursting with plush boysenberries, loganberries and blackberries, annotated with a streak of coffee and cacao."
Wolff,Red Blend,86.0,26.0,1,"Baked boysenberries, purple flowers and baking spice show on the nose of this widely available bottling. The palate is quite minerally, with crushed lava rocks, followed by cooked elderberry, black-cherry pie and a touch of clove."
Wolff,Teroldego,88.0,29.0,1,"Black-pepper-crusted beef, crushed graphite, dried mint, elderberries and blueberries show on the nose of this bottling. The palate reflects a juicy, fruit-forward style, with ripe mulberries and red plums lifted by star anise, clove and cinnamon."
Wolff,White Blend,90.0,22.0,1,"Aroma of freshly cut red apple, raspberry and cherry are followed by sweet jammy red and black-fruit flavors. It goes down easily."
Wonderment Wines,Sauvignon Blanc,87.0,30.0,1,"Light and muted, with sharp, leafy and herbal flavors. It seems to be drying out, leaving an impression of mushrooms rather than fruit. Drink now."
Wonderment Wines,Zinfandel,88.0,50.0,1,"There is dialed-high acidity on the front palate of this wine, followed by lean layers of pineapple and fig. Aged in 40% new French oak, the toast notes are subtle and the finish satisfyingly soft."
Wondrous,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.0,14.0,2,"Full body, plenty of tannin and subdued fruit flavors make this a tight, savory rather than fruity Syrah. It is definitely a food wine, with all the appetizing counterpoints for indulgent steaks, ribs or roasts."
Wood Family Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.33,46.67,3,"Key lime pie and chalk lead the nose on this affordable offering from a longtime Paso producer. The flavor profile is wide and welcoming, with apple, pear and citrus elements."
Wood Family Vineyards,Chardonnay,88.67,24.67,3,"Aged in a majority of neutral French oak, the wine has opening aromas that impart generous toasty characteristics before mellowing into nutty, vanilla swirls and a lingering taste of green apple."
Wood Family Vineyards,Red Blend,89.0,42.0,1,"Another ""dry"" Riesling that's not quite dry, this one starts off with spiced pears and hints of peaches that seem a bit soft at first, then turn gradually tarter and more focused on the finish."
Wood Family Vineyards,Syrah,84.0,24.0,1,"Slightly floral on the nose, with some pear and nectarine as well, this light-bodied wine blends sweet stone-fruit flavors with tart green apples on the palate, giving it a degree of balance."
Wood Family Vineyards,Zinfandel,87.0,32.0,6,"A wine this good makes you wish there were a lot more of it. Pure Sémillon from a single vineyard, fermented in stainless steel, it opens with lovely fragrances of linalool and citrus pith, softens up in the mouth, and brings grapefruit and a hint of wet stone. It has the power of Chardonnay with more complexity than most unoaked versions of that grape."
Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi,Chardonnay,86.5,8.0,2,"Drinking at its prime, the Isabella blends 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec and 11% Petit Verdot. Muscular and solid, the fruit flavors of cherry and plum are framed with ripe tannins. Accents of toasted walnuts, coffee and cream complete a thoroughly satisfying finish."
Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi,Zinfandel,84.0,8.0,1,"There's a slightly sour smell to this offering from Coomber Family, who produce “wines for animal lovers.” However, the sipping experience is pleasant enough, with hard cherry candy, a range of spices and a lingering licorice finish."
Woodenhead,Colombard,86.5,32.0,2,"Rustic, hearty aromas of tar, cola, herbs and burnt rhubarb make for an intriguing nose on this entry-level bottling from Testarossa. The sips feature cola and cherry flavors, with a very quick finish."
Woodenhead,Pinot Noir,91.0,57.0,4,"There's a tension between leanness and grip in this Cab, from the mountainous terrain of Atlas Peak. Black tea and tarragon intermingle between near-hidden layers of black fruit."
Woodenhead,Syrah,88.0,40.0,1,"The aromas of black fruit, vanilla and high-toned spice are brooding but display a sense of purity. The flavors are lighter styled, tart and supple, with bitters on the finish. Far from a big brawny bottle, it explores the variety's nuance."
Woodinville Wine Cellars,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90.5,30.0,6,"Very light in the glass and nimble throughout the sip, this is a promising young wine that may wind up quite excellent with some bottle age. Tightly wound black raspberry and strawberry fruit notes meet cinnamon, camphor and dewy eucalyptus on the nose, while the palate packs an array of thyme and bay leaf against a lighter cranberry fruit base."
Woodinville Wine Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.5,50.0,2,"From a two-acre block planted to the variety within this stately place, more famous for Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is herbal in dried sage, girded in big tannin and exhibiting plenty of density. Leathery black fruit, especially currant, and black pepper provoke the palate."
Woodinville Wine Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,92.0,50.0,1,"Assertive and delicious, this light-bodied and dry wine has dramatic aromas of wood smoke, wet stones and even diesel. Those are classic for the German grape varieties from which it was made, as are the light peach and white pepper flavors that ride an elegant texture and slightly sweet balance."
Woodinville Wine Cellars,Chardonnay,91.0,25.0,1,"Savory in personality and at first austere, this wine blossoms into a full-bodied, concentrated and tight-woven exploration of black cherry and dark chocolate, accented by 1% each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Elegant, it's also bold, and will successfully appeal to Cab drinkers."
Woodinville Wine Cellars,Malbec,91.0,39.0,2,"Rather elegant and well integrated aromas of stewed black cherries, clove, gingerbread and vanilla are reminiscent of a rich dessert. The palate is also full and flavorful with similar components as well as brown sugar, Vietnamese coffee, purple flowers and a lifting mint component. It's fruity but nuanced and fairly priced."
Woodinville Wine Cellars,Red Blend,88.33,28.33,3,A trove of wild strawberry wraps around a concentration of full-bodied smoothness in this deep and brooding wine marked by a juicy core and plenty of length on the finish.
Woodinville Wine Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,18.0,2,"Made from equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, with an additional 20% Malbec, this is a spicy, sturdy, full-bodied wine rich in restrained red fruit, leather and a healthy dose of tannin."
Woodinville Wine Cellars,Syrah,86.0,48.33,3,"Savory herb, fresh tobacco, dark cherry and anise aromas lead to elegant, pitch black fruit flavors. It brings plenty of outright appeal but should truly reveal its charms at the dinner table."
Woodinville Wine Cellars,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon,88.0,45.0,1,"All varietal, the aromas come off as a bit green, with notes of leafy fresh herbs, green tea, cedar and spice that haven't yet fully blossomed. The dark fruit flavors are generous while showing restraint and balance."
Woodstock Collection,Red Blend,91.0,72.0,1,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, deep and sappy, with the dark, licorice and coffee-infused complexity of Walla Walla's best bottles. Sharp and young, with a potent, liquorous finish, this explosive bottle of cassis-driven fruit should cellar well for a decade or more."
Woodstock Collection,Rosé,89.0,29.0,1,"The nose on the winery's annual Pomerol-focused blend of mostly Cabernet Franc and Merlot remains tightly wound, with purple fruit and tobacco just barely poking out. It's richly textured on the palate but the dark fruit flavors remain elegantly restrained throughout the sipping experience."
Woodstock Collection,White Blend,87.0,32.0,1,"Light salmon-pink in color, this refreshing wine is made from a combination of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, which all provide structure and complexity. Subtle in aroma and flavor, it is light and tart, leaning toward intriguing flavors of pomegranate and cranberry."
Woodward Canyon,Barbera,88.5,29.0,2,"Fragrant and soft, this sends up a chocolaty mix of strawberry and raspberry fruit scents and flavors. It's a barrel selection from a variety of vineyards, and is young enough to show a stiff, somewhat herbal edge to the tannins. Give it an hour or two in a decanter for best drinking."
Woodward Canyon,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93.5,79.0,2,"Minerals and earth lift the nose of this wine, with iron ore, rust and jet black soils alongside a touch of boysenberry fruit. The palate is sanguine as well, reflecting red volcanic dirts, with fruit trending toward violet and cranberry."
Woodward Canyon,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.35,61.75,20,"This is a fun and lively blend of 38% Grenache, 24% Cinsault, 21% Syrah and 17% Petite Sirah, with aromas of fresh wild berries and white pepper. The flavors are berry punch-like, with intriguing clove, licorice and anise."
Woodward Canyon,Chardonnay,92.5,57.0,2,"Like liquid toasted cinnamon, this Cabernet Sauvignon is texturally harsh."
Woodward Canyon,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,66.0,1,"This blend of equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel from the same site is a complex aromatic display of clove and bay. Simple and succulent, it's full-bodied and densely concentrated, emphasizing blackberry and strawberry flavors."
Woodward Canyon,Riesling,89.5,23.5,2,"Sourced entirely from old vine Tapteil fruit, this spent 32 months in French and American oak. It's loaded—as per usual with this winery—with generous, dark and smoky flavors of espresso, smoke and charcoal. But the fruit has the power and depth to handle it well, and as the wine breathes it smoothes out into a thoroughly luscious quaff."
Woodward Canyon,Sauvignon Blanc,91.75,26.0,4,"Smooth and spicy, matching bright, tight, sweet-tart lemony fruit to nicely integrated barrel notes of sandalwood and graham cracker. The sleek structure, balanced for cellaring as well as immediate enjoyment."
Wooldridge Creek,Red Blend,85.0,15.0,1,"Reserve caliber fruit—a throat-coating mix of blueberry, cherry and cassis—rolls into a rich, full throttle wash of barrel flavors. Toast, smoke, espresso and dark chocolate give the wine depth and gravitas. Ageworthy to be sure, but also enjoyable right now."
Work,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,82.0,75.0,1,"The first Washington wine to be released from the 2011 vintage hits the ground running, with ripe, round, rich flavors of honeyed pears and peaches. Succulent and fruity, it cuts its sharp acidity with 2% residual sugar, making for a wine with fine concentration and length."
Work,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,90.0,1,"A classically styled, beautifully made red, this is defined by its well-chiseled structure and sanguine characteristics, as well as notes of cranberry, dried herb and anise. Lush and full-bodied, it has additional elements of pencil shavings and meaty game, complex and interesting to the end. Enjoy best 2022 through 2032."
Work,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,75.0,1,"Aromas of fresh high-toned mortared herbs, raw meat, dried flowers, spice and dark fruit lead to broad yet elegant fruit and savory flavors. It brings a lovely sense of texture and freshness."
Workman Ayer,Red Blend,89.0,36.0,1,"Bold and spicy, this vineyard selection impresses with dusty tangy red and purple fruits. They are elevated with pineapple and citrus flavors from supporting acidity. The length and complexity are excellent, as is the entire lineup of 2014 Pinots from J. Christopher."
Workman Ayer,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,40.0,1,"The addition of 5% Merlot softens this wine, a lovely representation of the wild mountain appellation from a vineyard 2,000-feet up. Juicy and layered, the wine shows restraint and elegance amidst a woodsy forest component of lean, tart fruit and cocoa powder."
Workman Ayer,Viognier,88.25,21.0,4,"This wine is a blend of Grenache (45%), Mourvèdre (36%) and 19% Syrah. Reserved aromas of dark berry and herb lead to vibrant fruit flavors that display a lovely sense of texture and detail. The balance and combination of richness and restraint is exquisite, as is the finish. It impresses."
World's End,Cabernet Franc,86.0,50.0,1,"The aromas jump out of the glass, with notes of dried orange peel, fresh white flowers, herb, smoked meat, moist earth and potpourri. The palate is plush and lush with abundant fruit and savory flavors, with floral and gravel notes threaded throughout. It's as much about feel as flavor."
World's End,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.62,91.88,8,"A rich depth of flavor is at the heart of this wine, a mix of blueberry, blackberry and cherry that shows a generosity on the nose and palate. Bright acidity lifts the deeper, darker notes of toasted oak and cola."
World's End,Chardonnay,90.0,47.0,1,"Malbec makes up just over two-thirds of this blend, with the balance Cabernet. Aromas of bay leaf, plum, green herb and barrel spice are followed by sweet lush fruit flavors that bring a sense of layering and density. Give it some time to open up."
World's End,Merlot,89.0,47.0,1,"Tart and sappy, this compelling wine wraps its bright raspberry and cherry fruit in a veil of citrus and caramel. The various flavors entwine gracefully, with excellent balance and length. It's still young and forward, with primary flavors, but has the potential to age over the next decade."
World's End,Red Blend,88.0,102.0,1,"This is a full-bodied, fully hedonistic and feral wine, integrated in oak and tannin, that show a robust density on the palate of blackberry, wild sage and earth. With its robust ripeness and concentration, it features a brightness of acidity that helps complement its power."
Worthy,Chardonnay,84.0,31.0,1,"This fragrant, thoroughly delicious blend is the most widely available offering from this esteemed grower/producer. Floral highlights, ripe cherry fruit, and lightly herbal, slightly stiff tannins are in balance, and show the muscle and structure of a big wine still in its infancy. Tuck it away for a couple more years and watch it blossom."
Worthy,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,19.0,1,"Earth, mushroom and forest floor intrigue from sip one in this thick, densely structured effort from the great site. Cardamom, pine needle and cranberry contribute additional intrigue and spiciness to the palate, which is buoyed by bright, lengthy acidity and integrated oak."
Wrath,Chardonnay,88.8,28.2,5,"Dried red cherries, turned earth and wild herbs show on the nose of this bottling from the vineyard that winemaker Stephen Dooley shares with the Talley and Kynsi wineries. Tangy Montmorency cherries show strongly on the sip along with a thyme-lavender-rosemary potpourri touch, which is an intriguing combo that lingers long on the finish."
Wrath,Grenache,89.0,36.33,3,"Intensely perfumed this dark golden vineyard-designate is young and still resolving, youthfully fresh and alive. Coconut, Brazil nut and Asian pear give it context and texture, with a background invitation of homemade biscuit."
Wrath,Pinot Noir,91.43,41.36,14,"This is powerful wine made at a high level, a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Malbec and 8% Cabernet Franc. Muscular and dense, it offers a rich, ripe succulence of baked plum clafoutis, coconut, blackberry and clove within a dusty, gravelly brawn of dried herb and plush chocolate."
Wrath,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,35.0,1,"Made as a barrel and block selection from the producer's own estate vineyard along River Road, this is an inaugural release. It impresses in spicy rose, black tea and geranium, supple in tannin and structure with a robust, full-bodied lushness on the palate that lingers."
Wrath,Sauvignon Blanc,89.33,19.0,3,"Full-bodied and firm yet rounded in mouthfeel and generous in fruit flavors, this wine strikes a harmonious balance that makes it irresistible. It boasts blueberry, black cherry, dark chocolate and cinnamon flavors, its plush texture carrying them long into the finish."
Wrath,Syrah,92.33,29.67,3,"Lilac and olallieberry notes are enhanced by tobacco spice and white pepper on the nose of this rare Petite Sirah bottling from Santa Barbara County. Juicy and rich on the palate, it shows blackberry and blueberry fruit, accented with lavender and anchored with sticky tannins. The finish is marked by char and menthol."
Wrights Station,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,44.0,1,"This bottling from the cool-climate Jespersen Ranch offers baked black cherry, graphite, gingerbread and vanilla on the nose. There's a kick of white pepper on the palate, possibly owing to the 10% Syrah that's blended in, along with dark boysenberry fruit. The texture is grippy and serious for the grape."
Wrights Station,Chardonnay,90.75,32.5,4,"This classically styled red with 9% Merlot and 2% each of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot impresses with perfumed violet and its soft, smooth and succulent black cherry and currant flavor. Approachable and round, it has cedar and mocha undertones that make it memorable and compelling."
Wrights Station,Pinot Noir,91.71,44.71,7,"Bright, forceful and slightly reductive, this white is aged less than a year in neutral French oak, allowing the fruit to speak and offer richness on the midpalate. Gingerbread and lemongrass flavors accent its essential core of green apple fruit."
Wy'East Vineyards,Chardonnay,89.0,19.0,1,"Sanguine, leathery aromas show on the nose of this blend of 55% Syrah, 40% Mourvèdre and 5% Grenache, accented with dried elderberry, wild thyme, black plum and peppery spice. Woody flavors of bay leaf, black sage and rosemary show on the medium-bodied palate, with sour plum notes lifted by black pepper on the finish."
Wy'East Vineyards,Pinot Gris,91.0,19.0,1,"Still a bit fragmented, this offers a core of tight apple and peach fruit. It was barrel fermented (10% new) and that shell of barrel flavors has not yet smoothed into the fruit. Give it brisk aeration or another year in the bottle."
Wy'East Vineyards,Pinot Noir,88.6,35.6,5,"Aromas are light, with notes of potpourri, barrel spices, game and dark fruit. The black-cherry flavors are tart and puckering, also showing tannic grip. This wine seems disjointed at present."
Wölffer,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,84.0,40.0,1,"Candied red and purple fruit meets mocha and cola spice on the nose of this bottling, which is approachable and simple. The palate is tart with cranberry and plum skin flavors, lifted by dried ginger spice."
Wölffer,Rosé,87.0,29.0,1,"Aromas of whole green pepper, hot spice, cherry and baking spice are followed by lighter styled, tart, silky-feeling fruit and barrel flavors."
XIX,Cabernet Sauvignon,87.0,125.0,1,"Light and carbonic in tone, with a slight spritz to the acidity, this wine is ethereal, laced with black tea and tart cranberry flavors."
Y Rousseau,Cabernet Sauvignon,90.67,83.33,3,"This Bordeaux blend is a complex and sappy red with plenty of raspberry, cherry and cassis fruit flavor, tangy acids and ripe tannins. Young and tart, it is structured for age, compact and quite young. The oak brings in hints of butter and caramel."
Y Rousseau,Chardonnay,89.33,33.0,3,"This well-made wine features tangy flavors of citrus, nicely mingled with orange rind and a hint of grapefruit. Good texture, bracing acids, a food-friendly balance and some spicy complexity in the finish."
Y Rousseau,Colombard,89.8,20.8,5,"Neutral oak, 100% varietal. These three new releases from Cave B all taste of extremely young fruit, perhaps overcropped? In any event, without much going on. This is acidic, tastes like cranberry juice, with some volatility also."
Y Rousseau,Merlot,90.33,50.0,3,"Despite 15.1% alcohol, this is dull, one dimensional and rather light. The tannins are a little beefed up, but there's marginal fruit and everything seems a bit out of whack."
Y Rousseau,Tannat,88.75,24.0,4,"Barrel fermentation, with the full malolactic treatment, yields a ripe, buttery wine that sets up rich and plush on the palate. Despite the fat, buttery style it isn't overblown or flabby, and lingers through a clean, polished finish."
Yamhill Valley,Pinot Blanc,86.0,22.0,1,"A wonderful nose mixes pineapple/tropical fruits, honeysuckle and some spicy herbs. The crisp and clean flavors are of green berries, melon and vanilla. Best Buy."
Yamhill Valley,Pinot Blanc-Pinot Noir,85.0,16.0,1,"Delicate, elegant and floral, with light flavors of white peaches and citrus blossom carrying over to a lingering, nicely knit, stylish and elegant finish. Just 10% alcohol. Best Buy."
Yamhill Valley,Pinot Noir,87.29,29.86,7,"Pineapple, honeysuckle, baked apple and citrus all blend together in the nose. On the palate it is sweet but not too sweet, with good acid balance and just 10% alcohol. It adds up to a light, flavor-intensive dessert wine, with good concentration and appeal. Best Buy."
Yamhill Valley,Riesling,91.0,18.0,1,"The blend is 80% Zinfandel and 20% Petite Sirah. The nose is forward, with rich, ripe scents of plummy fruit and zingy spice. This is a lively, tart, zippy wine with attractive flavors. The fruit mingles plums, apples and berries; it's distinctive-very spicy and fairly lightweight, but still quite flavorful."
Yao Family Wines,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,225.0,1,"The blend is about two-thirds Pinot Gris and one-third Viognier. Pretty orange-blossom scents lead it off, and it has good acid balance and lots of lemony fruit. Yet it still feels like two separate wines coming together. Spice and pear flavors open up in the glass with a little swirling."
Yao Family Wines,Red Blend,92.0,48.0,1,"The blend is 79% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Franc and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is clear and bright, with sweet blueberry and cherry fruit and a pleasant whiff of barnyard. Very soft tannins and acids make for an easy-drinking red wine that would make a terrific house pour."
Yao Family Wines,Sauvignon Blanc,90.0,32.0,2,"This is 100% Cabernet from a 25-year-old estate vineyard. There’s plenty of vanilla and cassis in the nose, with some pickled volatile acidity lurking about. Firm and earthy, with a hint of mint and some dark, toasty streaks running through the red fruit. High-toned and slightly hot in the finish."
Yao Ming,Cabernet Sauvignon,94.0,625.0,1,"A pleasing shade of pale pink, this is a very austere bottling, with just faint touches of raspberry and tangerine on the nose. There is more light-red fruit and a hint of bubblegum on the palate, which offers decent tannic tension."
Yardstick,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.5,27.5,2,"This wine from the historic vineyard offers classic oaky aromas of smoke, butterscotch and salty roasted nuts. Smokiness lingers throughout the soft, excellently weighted palate that surrounds rich apple, nectarine and white peach flesh, with a citrus pith tension holding it together."
Yates Family Vineyard,Merlot,91.0,40.0,2,"With 4% Merlot, this Cab is aged just over two years in French oak and given almost as long in bottle before release. The result is satisfying, a swirl of savory black pepper, espresso, black cherry and tar smoothed out by dry tannins and restrained, toasty oak. The artist featured is Sonoma-based painter Keith Wicks."
Yellow Hawk Cellar,Red Blend,82.0,28.0,1,"From organically grown estate grapes, all of them Hanzell clone, this Pinot is light, earthy and elegant in its herbal composition and soft body. While approachable now, it has enough structure to last through 2018."
Yorba,Barbera,88.33,28.33,3,"Powerful and elegant aromas of tobacco, dark herbs, cedar and a touch of green pepper keep the nose entertained for quite a while. There's a peppery, meaty character to the palate, with purple fruits arising over time. This one will be even better in a few years."
Yorba,Red Blend,88.0,25.33,3,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), Merlot (25%) and Cabernet Franc from Klipsun, Ciel du Cheval, and Upchurch vineyards, this wine offers brooding notes of bittersweet chocolate, assorted red and black fruit, licorice, mineral and high-toned dried herbs. Reserved in style, it's full of coffee and cherry flavors, with mouthwatering acids and enough structure to go the distance."
Yorba,Rosado,87.0,28.0,1,"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc (60%) and Sémillon—all from Klipsun Vineyard—saw only eight months of neutral French barrel aging. It brings a pleasing assortment of fig, herbs, tropical fruit and corn silk notes with a broad, creamy texture and a drawn-out finish."
Yorba,Syrah,89.5,32.0,2,"There are light peach and honeysuckle aromas on this blend of 52% Grenache Blanc, 21% Viognier, 15% Picpoul Blanc and 12% Roussanne. The palate features a remarkably intriguing tension between ripe nectarine and lemon zest that holds through the entire sipping experience and beyond, with a refreshing mint character adding complexity. This vibrant wine will improve age into 2018 and beyond."
Yorba,Tempranillo,88.0,38.0,3,"A beautiful evocation of Washington fruit, it has concentration, balance and structure, and the clean berry/cherry fruit is amplified by polished tannins, bright acids and light splashes of peppery spice. This is one of the finest pure Washington Merlots to be released in many years."
Yorba,Zinfandel,90.0,28.0,1,"Lightness defines this wine, from its body to bouquet. Fresh-picked strawberry, cranberry and herb commingle nicely, but quite shyly, the fruit forwardness subtle and the structure refined. Spikes of mushroom and tea peak throughout."
Yorkville Cellars,Cabernet Franc,91.0,34.0,1,"Coming mostly from Stillwater Creek Vineyard, this wine is co-fermented with 4% Viognier. Dark fruit and orange peel aromas mix with sweet barrel spices. The blue fruit flavors are sweet and lush, carrying some warmth along with them."
Yorkville Cellars,Carmenère,88.0,35.33,3,"A charmingly seductive small lot from Tamas, a sister brand of Wente in the Livermore Valley. The wine has tremendous aromas of violet and oak that evolve into blackberry and cherry flavors, all dry and elegant at the end. Made from 88% Barbera and 12% Petite Sirah, serve this one with grilled meat."
Yorkville Cellars,Malbec,85.5,30.0,2,"Tight and precisely hewn, this is crystal clear and medium weight while pushing strawberry and cherry fruit into the core. Its 14 months in one-quarter new French oak added hints of vanilla custard."
Yorkville Cellars,Merlot,87.0,27.5,2,"The nose on this bottling is very familiar and approachable, with tons of baking spices like clove, star anise and vanilla alongside red cherries. The same red fruit upholds the palate, which is nuanced by eucalyptus and bay leaf as well as a graphite minerality."
Yorkville Cellars,Petit Verdot,87.0,29.33,3,"A lovely plum shade, this blends scents and flavors of pomegranate, cherry cola, Asian spice, black licorice and a dash of cacao. It's dense and penetrating, yet drinking well already. It spent nine months in 40% new French oak."
Yorkville Cellars,Sauvignon Blanc,88.0,18.0,1,"This is the first reserve Pinot Gris from the winery—half fermented in stainless, half in barrel. The wine feels as if it's very lightly oxidized, with dusty, tawny apple flavors that recall a good hard cider. Its power is in the persistent, bone dry finish, that never quits. Drink now through 2018."
Yorkville Cellars,Sparkling Blend,87.0,36.0,1,"From two blocks of a vineyard above Freestone that's strongly influenced by the ocean, this wine is marked by leathery pepper, baked cherry and an exotic mix of savory spice. Medium-bodied, it has a density that's both plush and lush."
Yorkville Cellars,Sémillon,87.0,20.0,1,"This wine is all bramble and brawn. High-octane in power and ripeness, it has a juicy core of mocha-laced blackberry fruit. Pencil shavings and gravel notes add a tease of minerality amongst all that richness."
Yorkville Cellars,White Blend,87.0,25.0,2,"Not quite as good as the 2007 Les Collines from this producer, but perhaps it just needs more bottle age. Light spritz and flavors of berry punch, along with not-yet-integrated barrel toast. Give it another year to fill out."
Young Inglewood,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94.0,75.0,1,"The Tempranillo has an agreeable entry, with pretty violet scents leading into tart raspberry and cherry fruit, amplified with a bit of barrel spice. It loses steam quickly, and the tannins turn chewy and a bit rough, but more bottle age may help smooth it out."
Young Inglewood,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,90.0,1,"Black cherry fruit anchors this pleasing bottle, nuanced with cola and a streak of chocolate. The tannins are smooth and supple, and the earthiness common in this AVA is carefully managed."
Young Inglewood,Chardonnay,94.0,60.0,1,"Big indeed, this is very dark and concentrated, with fruit-powered flavors wrapped in sweet baking spices. An impressive Petite Sirah that does not seem too tannic; the barrel flavors—vanilla, cinnamon, brown sugar—more than compensate, and the fruit is round and ripe enough to hold the focus."
Young Inglewood,Rosé,93.0,36.0,1,"Alexandria Nicole's Shepherds Mark is a Rhône blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, sourced from the Destiny Ridge (estate) vineyard. Barrel fermented in neutral oak, it presents an inviting floral blossom nose, leading into a delicious mix of citrus, white peach, melon and light tropical fruits. It's rich but never tiring."
Youngberg Hill Vineyards,Pinot Noir,87.6,43.0,10,"Roughly three-fifths Merlot and two fifths Cabernet Franc. Though the blend and oak treatment are quite similar to the 2005, this new release comes out with far better balance and structure. The oak flavors are lighter, the tannins are polished and lightly herbal, as befits Cabernet Franc, and there is a hint of steel in the backbone of this tight, svelte effort."
Z'IVO,Pinot Noir,86.0,25.0,1,"Bergevin's Bordeaux blend is almost jet black in color, thick with liquorous candied cherry and coffee scents. It's mostly Wahluke Slope (Stone Tree vineyard) fruit, and has the power to show for it. Black fruits, tar, coffee liqueur, chocolate, whiffs of tobacco make for a complex and compact wine that will reward cellaring."
Z. Alexander Brown,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.5,70.0,2,"Herb, spice, smoke and a whiff of roasted meat lead into a wine that is balanced and deep. This puts a focus on the dark side: black fruits, tar, coffee and smoke. It's grainy and tannic, and the tannins and toast may eventually outrun the fruit. But it's a good effort in a Washington style, that captures the black olive and herbal leanings of the Bordeaux grapes."
Z. Alexander Brown,Pinot Noir,86.0,20.0,1,"Supple and scented with a sweet mix of fruit, coffee and mocha, this expressive red blend (53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 8% Cab Franc, 8% Syrah) tastes of bright black cherry fruit, coffee grounds, some grainy tannins and a long finish that brings in pepper, spice and chocolate. Very accessible and full-flavored, it is built for immediate drinking rather than cellaring."
Z. Alexander Brown,Red Blend,88.33,20.0,3,"This is the fifth vintage for this rare Washington version of Petite Sirah. It is almost jet black in the center, purple at the rim, tight and tannic with plenty of acid sculpting the earthy, black cherry fruit. Loaded into the finish are layers of earth, iodine, tar and licorice; it's very well made and retains just enough roughness to satisfy lovers of this often rustic grape."
ZD,Cabernet Sauvignon,88.67,196.67,3,"This has a sweet charm to it, with a rich lemon flavor. This would be fine as a light dessert wine with lemon cake."
ZD,Chardonnay,89.5,71.25,4,"Quite tart and perhaps just a bit underripe, this red checks in at barely 12% alcohol. It has a bit of a Band-Aid scent that competes with the light berry flavors."
ZD,Pinot Noir,90.5,69.25,4,"Herbal and short, this offers a very light watermelon flavor, along with plenty of herb and tomato leaf notes. It's on the slender side, with a quick-to-fade finish."
Za Zin,Zinfandel,92.0,15.0,1,"Isolated as a single clone, this limited bottling comes across as sharp and grassy, with some sour plum fruit. The finish carries a hint of asparagus."
Zaca Mesa,Cabernet Sauvignon,92.0,48.0,1,"A lovely single-vineyard Chardonnay that's subtle and complex in pear, lemon and melon, integrated, soft on the palate and completely composed. The mouthfeel is creamy but bright, layers of grapefruit and tangerine accented by a slight tropical vibe."
Zaca Mesa,Chardonnay,90.5,22.0,2,"This wine bursts from the bottle with rich and appealing fragrances and flavors of grapefruit, pineapple and citrus. Tart and expressive, it seems to gain extra dimensions from fermentation with wild (native) yeasts. It holds a floral character that is most intriguing."
Zaca Mesa,G-S-M,91.0,20.0,1,"Deep plum and sweet tobacco leaf aromas mesh with sour and candied blueberry in this layered and luxurious wine from Petite Sirah specialists MCV. The palate is pleasantly broad, with chocolate and smoked cactus flavors, reminiscent of tequila. Both the tannins and acidity are proper and smooth."
Zaca Mesa,Pinot Blanc,89.0,22.0,1,"Heftier than the producer's Platt Vineyard Pinot, this estate-grown wine features astoundingly bright acidity around dense black cherry fruit. It saw 10% stem inclusion during fermentation and was aged in 20% new oak for just over a year, a recipe that works to buoy the wine and give it plenty of complexity."
Zaca Mesa,Pinot Noir,92.5,48.0,2,"Slightly cloudy with a lighter, cranberry juice color, this multi-layered wine begins with a nose of strawberry, pomegranate and black cardamom. It is deliciously refreshing on the palate, with rounded tomato and smashed berries dancing with eucalyptus and bay leaf, providing fruit-meets-spice excellence."
Zaca Mesa,Rhône-style Red Blend,90.5,27.5,4,"Aged more than two years in air-dried French oak, this is classic Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon, velvety and plush. It boasts juicy blackberry and black cherry fruit aromas and flavors, with weighty oak and a mix of coconut flake and chocolate that linger on the finish."
Zaca Mesa,Rhône-style White Blend,90.33,20.0,3,"Black cherry, leather, tar and nose-tickling clove aromas mix with a tad of green pepper on the nose of this signature bottling. The wine is very elegant in structure and memorable in flavors of peppercorn and cherry pie, all while retaining an acidic tartness."
Zaca Mesa,Rosé,89.0,18.0,4,"This estate Chardonnay is keeping stylistically with the winery's other offerings, though a tad weightier and richer in oak and crème brûlée. Fresh peach, pineapple and anise intermingle on the palate, with a silky yet complex texture. There is a palate-refreshing hint of lime on the finish."
Zaca Mesa,Sauvignon Blanc,89.0,22.0,1,"Bold and beautiful, this powerful Zin has a deep, dark color that's practically black but with a brilliant ruby rim. Brooding aromas suggest wood smoke, black pepper and boysenberry. There is an impressive density in texture, as firm tannins and acidity support the rich array of flavors."
Zaca Mesa,Syrah,91.29,55.5,14,"Juicy strawberry and raspberry fruits form the base of an aromatic profile that also picks up some sagebrush and dried cake frosting. Though lighter in body, the flavors emerge continually on the palate, from ripe berries to tomato stew to cola to mint. Serve with roasted chicken or turkey or even a rich pasta.  Bargetto has been making wine since 1933."
Zaca Mesa,Viognier,90.0,18.0,2,"Bloody, barely charred game aromas meet with slightly dusty raspberry and tomato in this unforgettable and unfiltered Bonny Doon experience, a blend of 30% Syrah, 28% Grenache, 22% Mourvèdre and 20% Cinsault. The sanguine sense carries to the palate, but so does a basket of red fruit, from cherry to pomegranate. A chalky tannic backbone will keep it drinking nicely for as long as patience holds."
Zagan's Fire,Sauvignon Blanc,83.0,15.0,2,"Light and floral, this is a complex, well-integrated Chardonnay that's bursting in just-sliced pineapple, with a layering of butterscotch and caramel. It's richly textured yet nicely balanced between savory and sweet. The acidity upholds the wine from entering into dense territory, a celebration of one heck of a sunny vintage in a glass."
Zagan's Fire,Verdelho,82.0,15.0,1,"Though given extra bottle age prior to release, this remains a bit stiff and tannic. Floral highlights and smoky tannins book-end the black fruits. Deep cassis and a bit of licorice wind through the finish. This is a blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petit Verdot, 8% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc."
Zenaida Cellars,Cabernet Sauvignon,91.0,28.0,1,"Crisp and penetrating, with great fruit purity, the wine's core bears cassis and black cherry flavors. The tannins are supple, even silky, and the finish is smooth, with dark accents."
Zenaida Cellars,G-S-M,93.0,35.0,2,"Complex and finessed, this has loads of flavor. The pretty cherry and plum notes are framed with a milk chocolate accent. The modest alcohol in no way diminishes the concentration."
Zenaida Cellars,Red Blend,91.5,33.0,2,"This is a particularly fine vintage for the popular Dr. Wolfe's, maintaining the customary blend of Primitivo, Lemberger and Petite Sirah. Dark and smoky, with dense flavors of berry, cassis, licorice and dark chocolate, it is far more substantial than most red blends in this price range."
Zenaida Cellars,Rhône-style White Blend,89.0,32.0,1,Though only aged in 30% new oak—half French and half Hungarian—the wood is far out front here with notes of vanilla and butterscotch overtaking the cherry. It's light in style with vanilla flavors throughout.
Zenith,Pinot Noir,90.33,35.0,3,"A pretty coppery color reminiscent of the rosés of southern France, this unusual blend of Mourvèdre, Syrah, Malbec and Viognier is done via the saignée (bleeding the tanks) method. Muted flavors of dried peach, banana and cantaloupe combine in an interesting way, but the finish has off-flavors."
Zenith,Tempranillo,87.0,30.0,1,This wine offers a sizable mouthful of blackberry and softened though persistent and present tannins. On the nose a whiff of rubber glove mars the wine.
Zepaltas,Chardonnay,91.67,43.33,3,"Crimson is half Merlot, one-third Cab Franc, the rest a mix of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. There's some volatility in the nose, with bright, spicy strawberry fruit swathed in light chocolate. The midpalate drops out."
Zepaltas,Pinot Noir,90.75,41.5,4,"This reserve wine is a four grape, Bordeaux-style blend, with Cabernet Sauvignon holding the principal spot. The flavors are diffuse, lightly herbal and peppery, with little concentration or definition."
Zepaltas,Rhône-style Red Blend,88.0,16.0,1,"As tasty as a pear tart, this combines mild pear, vanilla and almond flavors on a smooth texture. Medium bodied, balanced slightly to the soft side, and quite fruity, it will make a satisfying glass at cocktail time or with dinner."
Zerba Cellars,Red Blend,86.25,19.75,4,"Tart cran-apple fruit—some of it from 35-year-old vines—is at the heart of this vineyard-designated cuvée. It has a woody/earthy undertone, tart acids and some stiffening tannins."
Zero One Vintners,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86.0,15.0,1,"Dried cherries, black slate, brown spice and leather greet the nose on this affordable red from the esteemed regional producer that makes many Zinfandels each vintage. The palate shows black cherries and a plum skin acidity, with some rocky elements providing further intrigue."
Zero One Vintners,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,33.0,4,"A ripe, soft and well-integrated package of mountain fruit stars in this vineyard-designate, from a site high atop the Mayacamas Mountains that is famous for Zin. Spicy cinnamon spins itself through husky layers of black fruit and leather."
Zero One Vintners,Chardonnay,86.0,15.0,1,"Light and delicate on the nose with lime blossoms and damp herbs, this top-end bottling from Fred Brander shows lots of peppery energy once sipped. The tense palate is more about texture than flavors, yet wet cement, ripe lime, grass and oregano do make flashy appearances."
Zero One Vintners,Red Blend,86.0,12.0,1,"This wine, combined with 10% Petite Sirah, impresses in grip and softness, offering big, rich waves of raspberry, cinnamon and allspice, before unveiling a leathery finish. An all-around likable wine, it's ready to enjoy now."
Zero One Vintners,Riesling,89.0,14.67,3,"There's a reductive element to the nose of this wine, indicating the powerful nature of the vintage but also the wine's youth. Let it open to unveil an intensity of baked apple and white peach, along with heartier highlights of crème brûlée and vanilla toast. With a medium body and length, it has enough acidity to remain vibrant. It's sourced from a who's who of the region's vineyards."
Zero One Vintners,Sauvignon Blanc,86.0,13.0,4,"The aromas on this wine are quite reserved, while the flavors bring down a hammer of rich, tightly coiled, jammy black fruit flavors. If the aromas and flavors come together it goes up a notch or two."
Ziata,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92.0,100.0,1,"The purple flowers and pomegranate fruits that hit the nose first on this bottling give way quickly to savory elements of rosemary and roasted fennel. That savoriness carries to the palate, as does an earthy character, lifted by pine and juniper-berry spice."
Ziata,Pinot Noir,91.67,50.0,3,"This is a rich wine, with notes of buttermilk, toasted macadamia nut, bright Meyer lemon and orange blossom, all delivered in a measured manner. The palate shows walnut oil, orange bitters, coconut, pineapple and Gala apples, proving quite ripe but balanced by ample acidity."
Ziata,Red Blend,90.0,100.0,1,"Poached apple, tart nectarine skins and a tiny whiff of petrol decorate the nose of this single-vineyard study that received 14% new oak. It's clean and easy on the palate, with Golden Delicious apples, cement stoniness and a pear skin tartness."
Zimri Cellars,Pinot Gris,86.0,16.0,1,"A light, straightforward and focused wine, 100% varietal, this offers cranberry, mushroom and a complexity of tannin and oak. High acidity dances around fresh layers of strawberry and raspberry on the palate, with a grippy, cinnamon-spiced finish."
Zimri Cellars,Pinot Noir,88.0,30.0,2,"The inaugural release of this producer's GSM blend is comprised of 55% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 12% Mourvèdre. Jammy and dense in blackberry, espresso and leather, it offers a mouthful of flavor and intensity without ever becoming over the top."
ZinPhomaniac,Zinfandel,87.17,19.0,6,"The oak (40% new French and American) is up front, with aromas of barrel spices, cocoa and generous amounts of vanilla followed by cherries and blue fruit. This wine is velvety in feel, displaying a mixture of fruit and barrel that carries through the finish. The oak influence is heavy but the appeal is impossible to ignore."
Zinderella,Zinfandel,90.0,25.0,1,"There's brilliant black cherry and blackberry richness on the nose of this blend of 10 grapes, from Syrah to Malbec to Touriga Nacional, as well as a mineral character of cold asphalt, clay and mud. The palate offers earthy and delicious flavors, with dried strawberry and olallieberry as well as black pepper and cappuccino."
Zinfandelic,Zinfandel,85.25,19.25,4,"This powerful wine that also holds 5% Cabernet Franc shyly packs a punch. At first it comes off as elegant, soft and highly approachable. Faint notions of blackberry and black cherry are highlighted amidst a concentrated, tannic build."
Zinke,Rhône-style Red Blend,92.0,38.0,1,"Gentle on the front palate, this gorgeously rendered Cabernet Sauvignon, with smatterings of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, develops weight and body as it goes, while retaining classic restraint. Cherry and cassis counterpoise layers of toasty oak, cedar and silky tannins, finishing balanced."
Zinke,Syrah,92.0,45.0,2,"Aromas of a raspberry torte with flaky crust mix with cardamom and marjoram spices on another compelling wine from the region's historic producer. Tart cranberries kick off the palate, followed by wet slate and graphite minerality in the midpalate that barely hide riper fruits. It culminates in a cola-laced finish."
Zocker,Grüner Veltliner,90.33,20.0,3,"The producer continues to hit it out of the park with this vintage of Pinot, offering a gorgeously balanced interpretation of a marquee vineyard site. Rose petal and lavender aromas evolve into flavors of rosemary, high-toned orange peel, dried cherry and cranberry on the palate, keeping things ethereal throughout. Smooth and medium bodied, the tannins are coy and the entire experience memorable."
Zocker,Riesling,91.0,20.0,2,"Tropically layered in glazed pineapple and generously vibrant Asian pear, this wine offers heartiness at the beginning that evolves in the glass into a compellingly balanced wine. The oak is there, but well-integrated."
Zoetic Wines,Pinot Noir,93.0,65.0,2,"This blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon delivers notes of savory herbs, vanilla, cocoa and dark plum surrounded by a salty brine. The cranberry and blackberry flavors exhibit depth, elegance and purity, with a mesmerizing mouthfeel that leads to a hyper-extended, fruit-filled finish."
Zoetic Wines,Sauvignon Blanc,85.5,27.0,2,"A blend of Syrah and Grenache, still hard and tannic. The flavors of earth, coffee and dark toast conceal whatever the fruit might have to say, leaving a trail of bitterness in the finish."
Zotovich Cellars,Chardonnay,93.0,36.0,2,"The Santa Cruz producer Bargetto ventures into Lodi to make this old-vine Zin and unfortunately something gets lost in translation. The wine comes off a little bitter, like blackberries picked too soon."
Zotovich Cellars,Pinot Noir,88.0,36.0,2,"Warming spice, cherry and plum on the nose and palate give this wine a food-friendly edge. A touch of smoke and mocha adds appeal. Pair with grilled meats, pastas."
Zotovich Cellars,Viognier,89.0,28.0,1,"Tropical fruits, flowers and citrus lead this appetizing Chardonnay from Peconic. On the palate, the wine has some depth, with lemon/grapefruit citrus, pear and apple. A good everyday white."
Zucca,Malbec,83.0,28.0,1,"This wine offers lychee, apple and pear on the nose and palate and is both fresh and floral. Mouthwatering with a lingering finish. Pair with grilled poultry, salads, fruit or Indian cuisine."
Zucca,Rosé,87.0,18.0,1,"Citrus, apple, spice and flowers on the nose and palate give this pretty wine dimension. It's a simply good sip that will pair well with spicy cuisine and seafood."
Zynthesis,Zinfandel,84.0,11.0,1,"This Riesling has a zingy but complex character, starting with the pear, lemon and vanilla on the nose and the honey, apricot and lemon on the palate. It's elegant but easy drinking, and a great accompaniment to richer ethnic cuisine."
a-non-ah-mus,Grenache Blanc,91.0,24.0,1,"Citrus, spice and pear on the nose give way to waves of spice, white fruit and flowers on the palate. A pretty wine with a soft finish."
a-non-ah-mus,Syrah,87.0,37.0,1,"Cherry, blueberry, tea…this combination of Cab Franc from the Finger Lakes, Merlot from Long Island, and Baco Noir from the Hudson Valley is aged 24 months in oak and offers ample spice because of it. The black fruit/red berry is balanced by a minerality and a clean finish."
de Lancellotti,Pinot Noir,91.2,43.0,5,"This has a candied cherry color, vivid strawberry and cotton candy aromas, and on first sip a freshness that's almost startling. On second sip it's more like a light red wine, delicate, medium-bodied, very fruity but easy on the palate."
ded.reckoning,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.0,20.0,1,"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc (65%) and Sémillon comes from Sagemoor, Boushey and Klipsun vineyards. It starts out barrel-forward with aromas of char and toast followed by citrus oil, spice and herbs. The concentration of the tropical fruit flavors is light and elegant but shows pleasing nuances and a good sense of balance."
ded.reckoning,Merlot,88.0,20.0,1,"Flowers, melon and stone fruit inform the aromas and flavors of this unctuous, weighty and viscous wine, smooth with a lingering taste of ripe peach on the finish. Tiny percentages of Riesling and Gewürztraminer figure into the mix, too."
flipflop,Red Blend,81.0,7.0,1,"Rich in plum, black cherry and blackberry, this wine is subtle in cinnamon and dried herb, with additional embellishments of leather and earth. Soft and subdued, it's approachable and versatile."
iNapa Wine,Cabernet Sauvignon,83.0,80.0,1,"This wine is half Viognier with the rest Grenache Blanc and Roussanne. It offers aromas of almond, lees and peach. It's unctuous in feel but lighter in style with a touch of bitterness that distracts."
j.brix,Grenache,86.0,34.0,1,"This rare varietal bottling has lightly volatile aromas of Dimetap, raspberries, woodspice and herbs. Cranberry, raspberry and rose-hip flavors are full bodied and show purity. Drink now."
j.brix,Pinot Noir,91.0,36.0,1,"Lees notes take the lead on this unusual wine, followed by aromas of apricot, almond butter and cream. It drinks a hair off dry with a lightly creamy feel."
j.brix,Riesling,88.0,25.0,1,"Toasted oak and vanilla give this wine substance and style. It's fuller bodied and robust on the palate, still young and holding on to some weight. A touch of grapefruit spruces up the proceedings, providing crispness just in time."
kukkula,Grenache-Syrah,91.0,45.0,1,"Leather, dried cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sagebrush aromas are woven into a decent if not entirely lively nose. Lots of chopped fresh and dried herbs arise once sipped, along with gravel, black fruit and sticky tannins."
kukkula,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.71,42.86,7,"This elegant bottling is named after the late actor-turned-vintner's daughter, who still runs the company. It features well-integrated aromas of cherry, rhubarb and smoke. That smoke also shows on the palate, where piquant raspberry, dried lavender, thyme, rosemary and allspice sizzle toward a lively finish."
kukkula,Syrah,92.0,47.5,2,"Richly layered red fruit accents an explosion of firm lengthy tannin, alongside dashes of clove and cinnamon, in this hearty full-bodied red. Robust and concentrated, it shows oaky bursts of vanilla and smoke on the finish."
pb,Pinot Gris,92.0,18.0,1,"Mulberry, cherry, iron, raw beef and roasted pork aromas make for a gamy entry to this bottling, which also shows bay leaf and sage on the nose. Those sagebrush qualities are strong on the palate, which is reminiscent of an Asian-spiced meat dish, with rhubarb and pomegranate lending freshness."
un4seen,Red Blend,85.0,10.0,1,"Reticent aromas of lemon peel, honeysuckle, meringue, tangerine, sea salt and chalk show on the nose of this top-end white from one of the region's pioneering properties. Rounded pear and apple show on the palate, but it's chalky and restrained, with a vein of grapefruit peel and lime pith."
Écluse,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.67,46.0,3,"Housed within a beautifully artful bottle, this blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon does justice to both sides of the equation, offering clove, cedar and juicy black cherry within soft, rounded corners of texture. It's fleshy, lush and full bodied."
Écluse,Cabernet Sauvignon,93.0,41.0,2,"Bountiful and rich black fruits of black currant and black cherry meet with dark clove and other baking spices as well as a hint of maple on the nose of this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend. The palate's chalky structure is soft, allowing strong spice to rise amidst the black fruit in the midpalate, followed by a wave of plummy purple-flower flavors. The finish is all acid, which makes for a compelling combo of sensations."
Écluse,Red Blend,93.0,38.0,2,"This is a well-composed and memorable wine. It offers a wealth of complexity in dusty graphite and black cherry, teased by wisps of soy and tobacco. The finish shows spicy clove that lasts for days."
Écluse,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.33,38.0,3,"Soft supple tannins open a gateway of big bold respectable power and flavor in this vineyard designate from the famous Napa Valley grower. Black pepper, mountain-like sage, milk chocolate, cedar and pencil shavings all rise to the fore of this impressive, complex, interwoven wine that should do well in the cellar and be enjoyable now."
Écluse,Rhône-style White Blend,88.0,28.0,1,"This wine exudes classic aspects of the appellation, combining power with graceful elegance and finesse, though that finesse is more tightly wound in this vintage. Plummy and thick in dusty tannin, it's a structured, lovingly crafted and complex wine, eager to be cellared and enjoyed at its best 2026–2031."
Écluse,Syrah,92.0,38.0,1,"Richness makes this wine exceptional, while it still keeps its varietal personality. Aromas are grapy, almost jammy, then the flavors are quite fruity and berrylike, accented by mineral and chocolate notes. A finely tannic texture braces everything for an appetizing mouthfeel."
Élevée Winegrowers,Pinot Noir,93.0,45.0,3,"This vibrant wine shows how well this grape variety does in Amador County. It melds beautiful, pure, almost jammy aromas and flavors with a rich, layered and soothing texture. The color is quite dark, the aromas drip blackberry and boysenberry, the flavors are deep and the mouthfeel broad."
Órale,Rhône-style Red Blend,91.0,30.0,1,"This wine showcases the producer's prowess with two varieties, adding 25% Petite Sirah into the mix. Woody, funky earth meets tobacco and black tea while firm, soft tannins provide structure and luxury. A generous helping of chocolate adds warmth to the flavors."
àMaurice,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,91.0,44.0,4,"The Pfeiffer Vineyard also contributes fruit for the winery's excellent Unity bottling. Here, its grapes are the whole show, and the wine is focused and substantial. It drills down with precise flavors of peach and pear with a touch of citrus, all showing excellent length and depth."
àMaurice,Cabernet Sauvignon,89.33,65.0,3,"Strong cedar notes greet the nose alongside charred red bell pepper, crushed gravel and elderberry fruit. Pencil shavings are prominent on the very full and complex palate, giving nuance to black plums, roasted beef, charcoal and dark chocolate."
àMaurice,Chardonnay,90.0,28.0,1,"A classy, spicy oak aroma and very concentrated fruit flavors highlight this full-bodied and firmly tannic wine. It's so layered and saturated with delicious dark fruit that the impression stays on the tongue and palate for a long finish."
àMaurice,Malbec,90.8,40.4,5,"This well-balanced wine tastes more nimble than the huge bottle it comes in. The wine has oak and balsam aromas, fresh raspberry and cherry flavors, full body and just-right moderate tannins for good grip on the palate. This is a great example of a high-alcohol wine that doesn't taste extreme and is very enjoyable."
àMaurice,Marsanne-Viognier,89.0,35.0,1,"Predominantly Merlot, this Bordeaux-style blend includes 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Cab Franc and 11% Malbec. Given extra bottle age prior to release, it's drinking quite nicely, with plum and black cherry fruit, a rich layer of mocha, and a firm finish with polished tannins and lemony acids."
àMaurice,Red Blend,89.0,18.0,1,"This is a fluid, fruit-laden, well-balanced blend. Spicy and herbal purple fruits are highlighted with cayenne pepper, chocolate and a pleasing hint of violets."
àMaurice,Syrah,89.67,43.83,6,"Always a fine value in the Gorman lineup, this new Zachary's Ladder is the best yet. It's half Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Syrah, and 10% Petit Verdot, yielding a plush, mouthfilling wine that remains light on its feet. Credit the lively acidity that elevates mixed red berry fruits and finishes with a kiss of milk chocolate."
àMaurice,Syrah-Grenache,93.0,34.0,1,"Impressive in its size and weight, this wine has tart fruit flavors of pomegranate and blueberry, with a dusting of coffee grounds. Tannins are ripe, firm and sleek, and the structure impactful. This needs even more bottle age or some hours of aeration."
àMaurice,Viognier,90.5,34.0,2,"The producer blends 57% Chardonnay from the Maldonado Vineyard with 39% Sauvignon Blanc and 4% Viognier for this fresh, floral white. On the palate, apple and lemon flavors are buttressed by a core of laser-like acidity. A fresh pear note lasts long into the finish, proving the wine's ability to be both creamy and crisp."
